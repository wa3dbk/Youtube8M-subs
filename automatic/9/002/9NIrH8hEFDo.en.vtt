right here you have your your ball stud

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.019 
right here you have your your ball stud
for<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:25.800> rear<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> Shack<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.670> you

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
for the the rear of the Shack and you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.110 
for the the rear of the Shack and you
pop<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.019> off<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.470> real<00:00:28.650> quick

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.410 

now<00:00:34.690> you<00:00:34.750> can<00:00:34.930> see<00:00:35.170> this<00:00:35.560> one<00:00:35.770> has<00:00:35.950> I<00:00:36.250> have<00:00:37.090> four

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
now you can see this one has I have four

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.700 
now you can see this one has I have four
millimeters<00:00:37.990> past

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.380 

the<00:00:42.220> the<00:00:42.610> x1<00:00:42.970> mounts<00:00:43.840> or<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.200> actual<00:00:45.390> cross

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
the the x1 mounts or the actual cross

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.410 
the the x1 mounts or the actual cross
member<00:00:46.780> on<00:00:46.810> the<00:00:47.020> pod<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:51.010> normally<00:00:51.490> most

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
member on the pod now normally most

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.570 
member on the pod now normally most
people<00:00:52.840> are<00:00:52.900> running<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.200> damper<00:00:54.070> disc<00:00:54.310> as

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
people are running the damper disc as

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.270 
people are running the damper disc as
well<00:00:55.180> as<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:58.480> know<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:59.050> with<00:00:59.830> a<00:00:59.860> typical

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
well as you know the with a typical

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.650 
well as you know the with a typical
chakra<00:01:00.580> set<00:01:00.730> up<00:01:00.820> if<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.150> of<00:01:01.240> the<00:01:01.330> damper

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
chakra set up if the of the damper

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.170 
chakra set up if the of the damper
discounters<00:01:02.230> and<00:01:02.410> and<00:01:03.160> so<00:01:03.400> I<00:01:03.430> would<00:01:03.640> think<00:01:03.820> for

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
discounters and and so I would think for

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.020 
discounters and and so I would think for
a<00:01:04.980> typical<00:01:05.980> application<00:01:06.070> this<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:06.730> anymore

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
a typical application this is anymore

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
a typical application this is anymore
like<00:01:07.620> two<00:01:08.620> millimeters<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.960> you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
like two millimeters and to what you

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.980 
like two millimeters and to what you
have<00:01:11.230> the<00:01:11.380> damper<00:01:11.740> disks<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.430> damages<00:01:12.850> is<00:01:13.360> the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
have the damper disks the damages is the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.600 
have the damper disks the damages is the
graphite<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:14.830> probably<00:01:15.100> about<00:01:15.220> two

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
graphite is probably about two

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.859 
graphite is probably about two
millimeters<00:01:15.970> tall<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.650> I<00:01:17.680> got<00:01:17.830> four<00:01:18.070> on<00:01:18.220> here

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
millimeters tall but I got four on here

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.680 
millimeters tall but I got four on here
and<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:21.340> think<00:01:21.610> I<00:01:21.700> was<00:01:21.850> significant<00:01:22.450> at<00:01:22.540> least

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
and I think I was significant at least

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.730 
and I think I was significant at least
for<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:22.900> for<00:01:23.229> asphalt<00:01:23.380> racing<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:25.740> this

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
for a for asphalt racing this this

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.890 
for a for asphalt racing this this
height<00:01:26.979> back<00:01:27.220> here<00:01:28.050> was<00:01:29.050> extremely<00:01:29.800> sensitive

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
height back here was extremely sensitive

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.010 
height back here was extremely sensitive
I'm<00:01:32.790> putting<00:01:33.790> traction<00:01:34.240> into<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.540> car

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.450 

basically<00:01:38.770> as<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:41.110> I<00:01:41.350> brought<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:42.220> know<00:01:42.310> this

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
basically as as I brought you know this

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.020 
basically as as I brought you know this
this<00:01:42.700> height<00:01:42.940> down<00:01:43.210> closer<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.790> make<00:01:45.909> the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
this height down closer to to make the

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.980 
this height down closer to to make the
shock<00:01:46.240> level<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:48.100> know<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.970> more<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.750> shot

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
shock level you know the more the shot

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.390 
shock level you know the more the shot
got<00:01:50.200> towards<00:01:50.500> level<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.909> more<00:01:53.400> on

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
got towards level the more on

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.139 
got towards level the more on
power-steering<00:01:55.119> but<00:01:55.479> also<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.770> less<00:01:57.040> for<00:01:58.000> the

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
power-steering but also the less for the

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.980 
power-steering but also the less for the
decrease<00:01:58.899> in<00:01:59.200> overall<00:01:59.770> rear<00:02:00.130> traction<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
decrease in overall rear traction and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.980 
decrease in overall rear traction and
the<00:02:02.200> higher<00:02:02.619> this<00:02:02.860> this<00:02:03.250> rises<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:04.479> creates

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
the higher this this rises it creates

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.510 
the higher this this rises it creates
push<00:02:05.470> but<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.979> car<00:02:06.190> also<00:02:06.340> locks<00:02:06.670> down<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:09.369> in

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
push but the car also locks down so in

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.440 
push but the car also locks down so in

if you're for some reason really locked

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.390 
if you're for some reason really locked
down<00:02:25.870> which<00:02:26.140> doesn't<00:02:26.440> happen<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.800> ton<00:02:27.010> but<00:02:27.250> if

bring this ball stud you know further
down<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:33.610> will<00:02:33.700> help<00:02:33.880> out<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.989> car<00:02:35.200> Road

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
down and that will help out the car Road

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.050 
down and that will help out the car Road
steering<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.010> again<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.880> really

steering and again it's it's a really

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.820 
steering and again it's it's a really
fine

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
fine

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.220 
fine
it's<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.920> fine<00:02:39.130> line<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.760> know<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.390> was<00:02:40.630> changing

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
it's a fine line you know I was changing

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.310 
it's a fine line you know I was changing
half<00:02:41.470> millimeter<00:02:42.450> increments<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.870> then<00:02:44.200> you

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
half millimeter increments and then you

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.050 
half millimeter increments and then you
could<00:02:44.470> feel<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.920> on<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.190> track<00:02:45.400> was<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.880> was

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
could feel it on the track was I was

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.240 
could feel it on the track was I was
completely<00:02:46.840> amazed<00:02:47.230> by<00:02:47.470> how<00:02:47.620> different<00:02:48.040> was

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
completely amazed by how different was

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.440 
completely amazed by how different was
just<00:02:48.519> in<00:02:48.700> half<00:02:48.880> millimeter<00:02:49.329> increments<00:02:49.690> now

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
just in half millimeter increments now

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.199 
just in half millimeter increments now
you<00:02:52.450> can<00:02:52.630> also<00:02:52.750> change<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:53.549> height<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:54.970> in

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
you can also change this height to in

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.360 
you can also change this height to in
the<00:02:55.299> front<00:02:55.709> near<00:02:56.709> your<00:02:57.670> front<00:02:57.820> ball<00:02:58.150> stud

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
the front near your front ball stud

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.080 
the front near your front ball stud
again<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.400> don't<00:03:00.579> know<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.829> haven't<00:03:02.910> done<00:03:03.910> that

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
again I don't know I haven't done that

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.449 
again I don't know I haven't done that
as<00:03:04.360> much

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
as much

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.080 
as much
simply<00:03:06.459> because<00:03:06.579> it's<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> little<00:03:06.970> more

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
simply because it's a little more

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.699 
simply because it's a little more
inconvenient<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.410> reach<00:03:08.650> this<00:03:08.890> ball<00:03:09.130> stud

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
inconvenient to to reach this ball stud

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.720 
inconvenient to to reach this ball stud
saying<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.860> though

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.550 

this<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.480> typically<00:03:15.810> what<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.080> would<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.409> is

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
this is typically what I would this is

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.780 
this is typically what I would this is
the<00:03:16.709> one<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:16.950> would<00:03:17.129> actually<00:03:17.250> raise<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.760> lower

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
the one I would actually raise and lower

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.190 
the one I would actually raise and lower
on<00:03:18.060> f103<00:03:18.709> but<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:20.780> don't<00:03:21.780> have<00:03:21.900> as<00:03:22.080> much

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
on f103 but I don't have as much

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.930 
on f103 but I don't have as much

carpet<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.720> this<00:03:25.170> adjustment<00:03:25.739> seems<00:03:26.010> in

carpet this this adjustment seems in

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.479 
carpet this this adjustment seems in
general<00:03:27.209> seems<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.629> be<00:03:27.780> less<00:03:30.830> less<00:03:31.830> effective

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
general seems to be less less effective

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.220 
general seems to be less less effective
or<00:03:32.670> maybe<00:03:32.940> just<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.209> little<00:03:33.239> more<00:03:33.480> or<00:03:33.959> less

detractions<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.079> little<00:03:43.260> different<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.650> it's

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
detractions a little different and it's

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.460 
detractions a little different and it's
rubber<00:03:44.099> tires<00:03:44.370> as<00:03:44.579> well<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.140> seems<00:03:46.349> to

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
rubber tires as well so it that seems to

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.110 
rubber tires as well so it that seems to
make<00:03:46.650> things<00:03:46.950> more<00:03:47.190> sensitive<00:03:49.819> now<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:50.879> other

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
make things more sensitive now the other

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.589 
make things more sensitive now the other
thing<00:03:51.360> too<00:03:51.569> is<00:03:51.599> is<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.590> right<00:03:52.769> height<00:03:53.150> at<00:03:54.150> the

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
thing too is is the right height at the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:01.850 
thing too is is the right height at the
front<00:03:55.079> I<00:03:57.260> don't<00:03:58.260> know<00:03:58.349> if

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.330 

it's<00:04:02.430> easy<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.850> tell<00:04:03.120> necessarily<00:04:04.020> or<00:04:04.110> not<00:04:04.340> but

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
it's easy to tell necessarily or not but

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.300 
it's easy to tell necessarily or not but
this<00:04:06.210> car<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:08.570> you<00:04:09.570> know<00:04:09.860> it's<00:04:10.860> basically<00:04:11.130> your

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
this car is you know it's basically your

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.540 
this car is you know it's basically your
your<00:04:11.640> your<00:04:12.030> right<00:04:12.180> height<00:04:12.420> back<00:04:12.630> here<00:04:13.550> is

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
your your right height back here is

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.520 
your your right height back here is
lower<00:04:15.350> than<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> right<00:04:16.530> hand<00:04:16.590> up<00:04:16.830> front<00:04:18.530> and

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
lower than the right hand up front and

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.770 
lower than the right hand up front and
generally<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.280> found<00:04:20.640> that<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.510> more<00:04:21.690> you

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
generally I found that the more you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.110 
generally I found that the more you
raise<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.140> right<00:04:22.290> height<00:04:22.530> at<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.710> front<00:04:23.120> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
raise the right height at the front the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.310 
raise the right height at the front the
more<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.450> car<00:04:24.660> is<00:04:24.810> going<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:24.990> be<00:04:25.080> able<00:04:25.170> to

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
more the car is going to be able to

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.930 
more the car is going to be able to
watch<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:26.220> more<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.490> car<00:04:26.670> is<00:04:26.760> going<00:04:26.880> to

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
watch and the more the car is going to

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.570 
watch and the more the car is going to
be<00:04:27.060> able<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.450> have<00:04:28.970> stability<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:32.430> that's

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
be able to have stability and that's

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.420 
be able to have stability and that's
actually<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:32.940> pretty<00:04:33.120> good<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:34.250> pretty<00:04:35.250> good

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
actually a pretty good a pretty good

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.370 
actually a pretty good a pretty good
adjustment<00:04:35.580> just<00:04:36.120> because<00:04:36.480> it<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:37.140> doesn't

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
adjustment just because it it doesn't

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.370 
adjustment just because it it doesn't
totally<00:04:38.210> change<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.360> way<00:04:39.600> your<00:04:39.780> car<00:04:39.990> drives

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
totally change the way your car drives

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.310 
totally change the way your car drives
in<00:04:40.710> terms<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.330> steering<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.450> stuff<00:04:42.630> but<00:04:42.870> it

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
in terms of steering and stuff but it

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.890 
in terms of steering and stuff but it
does<00:04:43.530> it<00:04:43.800> will<00:04:43.920> take<00:04:44.130> away<00:04:44.340> some<00:04:44.370> steering<00:04:45.090> but

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
does it will take away some steering but

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.180 
does it will take away some steering but
it<00:04:45.960> generally<00:04:46.170> locks<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.590> car<00:04:46.800> down<00:04:46.980> a<00:04:47.010> little

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
it generally locks the car down a little

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.430 
it generally locks the car down a little
more<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.430> think<00:04:47.610> it's<00:04:47.730> more<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:48.440> an

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
more I think it's more of a an

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.420 
more I think it's more of a an
adjustment<00:04:49.860> for<00:04:50.130> coming<00:04:51.060> out<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:51.390> the<00:04:51.450> corner

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
adjustment for coming out of the corner

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.040 
adjustment for coming out of the corner
to<00:04:53.430> raise<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.790> front<00:04:54.030> end<00:04:54.180> up<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:56.400> know<00:04:56.460> that

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
to raise the front end up you know that

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.810 
to raise the front end up you know that
generally<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.110> just<00:04:58.170> try<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.560> run<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.190> rears

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
generally I just try to run the rears

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.810 
generally I just try to run the rears
about<00:05:00.210> as<00:05:00.330> low<00:05:00.510> as<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.690> can<00:05:00.750> get<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:03.260> cuz

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
about as low as you can get it cuz

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.180 
about as low as you can get it cuz
that's<00:05:06.260> pretty<00:05:07.260> much<00:05:07.380> it<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.620> mean<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:07.800> have<00:05:08.010> this

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
that's pretty much it I mean I have this

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.840 
that's pretty much it I mean I have this
thing<00:05:08.370> adjust<00:05:08.790> it<00:05:08.910> out<00:05:09.030> right<00:05:09.240> now<00:05:09.450> to<00:05:10.850> you

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
thing adjust it out right now to you

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.460 
thing adjust it out right now to you
know<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.060> number<00:05:12.480> two<00:05:12.690> adjuster<00:05:13.140> with<00:05:13.320> the

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
know the number two adjuster with the

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.230 
know the number two adjuster with the
the<00:05:13.860> axle<00:05:14.160> all<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:14.640> know<00:05:14.730> flipped<00:05:15.090> over

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
the axle all that you know flipped over

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.700 
the axle all that you know flipped over
so<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.510> axle<00:05:15.810> all<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.020> way<00:05:16.110> up<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.410> that's<00:05:16.500> as

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
so the axle all the way up and that's as

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.970 
so the axle all the way up and that's as
much<00:05:16.860> as<00:05:17.010> you<00:05:17.100> can<00:05:17.220> get<00:05:17.400> out<00:05:17.460> of<00:05:17.610> it

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
much as you can get out of it

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.130 
much as you can get out of it
but<00:05:19.980> the<00:05:20.100> front<00:05:20.870> generally<00:05:21.870> you<00:05:21.930> want<00:05:22.080> to

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
but the front generally you want to

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.840 
but the front generally you want to
start<00:05:22.320> trying<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:22.650> raise<00:05:23.100> up<00:05:23.340> if<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:23.580> want<00:05:23.760> the

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
start trying to raise up if you want the

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.870 
start trying to raise up if you want the
car<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.060> launch<00:05:24.770> so<00:05:25.770> those<00:05:26.610> are<00:05:26.760> a<00:05:26.790> couple

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
car to launch so those are a couple

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.800 
car to launch so those are a couple
simple<00:05:27.330> things<00:05:28.040> that<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:29.790> was<00:05:30.240> able<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.540> fool

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
simple things that I was able to fool

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.540 
simple things that I was able to fool
around<00:05:30.900> with<00:05:31.110> when<00:05:31.980> I<00:05:32.040> went<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.340> Memphis

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
around with when I went to the Memphis

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.700 
around with when I went to the Memphis
TCS<00:05:33.180> race<00:05:33.450> and<00:05:33.750> that<00:05:33.810> was<00:05:33.990> that<00:05:34.410> worked<00:05:34.590> out

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
TCS race and that was that worked out

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.230 
TCS race and that was that worked out
pretty<00:05:34.770> well<00:05:35.040> for<00:05:35.220> me<00:05:37.820> you<00:05:38.820> know<00:05:38.910> in<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.060> end

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
pretty well for me you know in the end

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.720 
pretty well for me you know in the end
just<00:05:39.990> to<00:05:40.080> also<00:05:42.110> review<00:05:43.110> this<00:05:43.730> this

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
just to also review this this

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.290 
just to also review this this
adjustments<00:05:45.300> still<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:47.490> track<00:05:47.790> they<00:05:48.000> had<00:05:48.150> was

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
adjustments still the track they had was

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.110 
adjustments still the track they had was
it<00:05:48.480> was<00:05:48.630> um

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
it was um

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.650 
it was um
VHT<00:05:51.770> enhanced<00:05:52.770> let's<00:05:53.070> put<00:05:53.220> it<00:05:53.280> that<00:05:53.310> way<00:05:53.460> and<00:05:53.790> I

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
VHT enhanced let's put it that way and I

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.190 
VHT enhanced let's put it that way and I
was<00:05:55.290> able<00:05:55.410> to<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:56.010> really<00:05:56.540> put<00:05:57.540> a<00:05:57.570> lot<00:05:57.630> of<00:05:57.900> angle

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
was able to to really put a lot of angle

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.390 
was able to to really put a lot of angle
on<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.470> first<00:05:58.710> day<00:05:58.890> when<00:05:59.160> there<00:05:59.280> was<00:05:59.370> more

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
on the first day when there was more

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.100 
on the first day when there was more
traction<00:05:59.910> I<00:06:00.150> was<00:06:00.270> actually<00:06:00.630> able<00:06:00.810> to<00:06:00.930> put<00:06:01.080> a

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
traction I was actually able to put a

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.450 
traction I was actually able to put a
lot<00:06:01.260> of<00:06:01.380> angle<00:06:01.620> in<00:06:01.680> the<00:06:01.830> arms<00:06:02.100> in<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.250> car

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
lot of angle in the arms in the car

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.850 
lot of angle in the arms in the car
responded<00:06:02.910> well<00:06:03.140> but<00:06:04.140> by<00:06:04.290> the<00:06:04.350> second<00:06:04.710> day<00:06:04.830> I

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
responded well but by the second day I

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.450 
responded well but by the second day I
was<00:06:04.890> I<00:06:05.220> was<00:06:05.430> bringing<00:06:05.640> things<00:06:05.910> back<00:06:06.920> to<00:06:07.920> normal

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
was I was bringing things back to normal

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.540 
was I was bringing things back to normal
the<00:06:08.850> normal<00:06:09.180> way<00:06:09.300> I<00:06:09.330> run<00:06:09.570> it<00:06:09.690> and<00:06:09.840> I<00:06:10.550> found

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
the normal way I run it and I found

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.850 
the normal way I run it and I found
actually<00:06:12.080> you<00:06:13.080> know<00:06:13.170> it<00:06:13.230> was<00:06:13.350> it<00:06:13.500> was<00:06:13.590> nice<00:06:13.710> to

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
actually you know it was it was nice to

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.170 
actually you know it was it was nice to
be<00:06:13.980> able<00:06:14.040> to<00:06:14.220> kind<00:06:14.400> of<00:06:14.430> go<00:06:14.550> through<00:06:14.730> this<00:06:14.910> stuff

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
be able to kind of go through this stuff

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.620 
be able to kind of go through this stuff
and<00:06:15.360> review<00:06:17.030> some<00:06:18.030> of<00:06:18.060> the<00:06:18.150> ideas<00:06:18.480> I<00:06:18.510> had

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
and review some of the ideas I had

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.090 
and review some of the ideas I had
because<00:06:18.960> just<00:06:19.140> sometimes<00:06:19.560> it's<00:06:19.680> good<00:06:19.800> to<00:06:19.830> test

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
because just sometimes it's good to test

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.410 
because just sometimes it's good to test
things<00:06:20.250> over<00:06:20.580> and<00:06:20.640> over<00:06:20.730> just<00:06:21.030> to<00:06:21.120> make<00:06:21.270> sure

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
things over and over just to make sure

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.820 
things over and over just to make sure
you<00:06:21.510> really<00:06:21.780> got<00:06:21.930> a<00:06:21.960> lock<00:06:22.440> on<00:06:22.470> what's

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
you really got a lock on what's

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.330 
you really got a lock on what's
happening<00:06:23.220> and<00:06:23.940> you<00:06:25.070> know<00:06:26.210> raising<00:06:27.210> this<00:06:27.330> up

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
happening and you know raising this up

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.590 
happening and you know raising this up
just<00:06:29.340> helped<00:06:29.550> to<00:06:29.730> make<00:06:29.910> that<00:06:30.090> car<00:06:30.330> less

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
just helped to make that car less

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.310 
just helped to make that car less
sensitive<00:06:31.110> and<00:06:31.260> easier<00:06:31.590> to<00:06:31.680> drive<00:06:32.180> so<00:06:33.320> you

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
sensitive and easier to drive so you

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.960 
sensitive and easier to drive so you
know<00:06:34.490> there's<00:06:35.490> nothing<00:06:35.610> wrong<00:06:35.910> with

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
know there's nothing wrong with

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.730 
know there's nothing wrong with
flattening<00:06:36.450> the<00:06:36.600> arm<00:06:36.780> out<00:06:36.960> you<00:06:37.500> know<00:06:37.590> it

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
flattening the arm out you know it

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.260 
flattening the arm out you know it
really<00:06:38.130> does<00:06:38.310> seem<00:06:38.460> to<00:06:38.520> help<00:06:38.760> the<00:06:38.880> car<00:06:39.060> and<00:06:39.210> you

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
really does seem to help the car and you

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.290 
really does seem to help the car and you
can<00:06:39.420> still<00:06:40.340> have<00:06:41.340> you<00:06:41.730> can<00:06:41.880> still<00:06:42.090> put

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
can still have you can still put

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.600 
can still have you can still put
steering<00:06:42.660> in<00:06:42.840> the<00:06:42.900> car<00:06:43.140> but<00:06:43.350> it's<00:06:43.470> not<00:06:43.610> you

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
steering in the car but it's not you

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.090 
steering in the car but it's not you
know<00:06:44.700> too<00:06:44.760> crazy<00:06:45.620> the<00:06:46.620> one<00:06:46.740> thing<00:06:46.920> I<00:06:46.980> was

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
know too crazy the one thing I was

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.980 
know too crazy the one thing I was
surprised<00:06:47.460> about<00:06:47.490> though<00:06:47.870> changing<00:06:48.870> the

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
surprised about though changing the

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.450 
surprised about though changing the
actual<00:06:49.320> position<00:06:49.470> of<00:06:49.800> the<00:06:51.860> camber<00:06:52.860> plate<00:06:53.100> feel

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
actual position of the camber plate feel

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.580 
actual position of the camber plate feel
for<00:06:53.670> different<00:06:53.700> cambers<00:06:54.390> I<00:06:54.570> actually<00:06:55.350> was

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
for different cambers I actually was

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.290 
for different cambers I actually was
finding<00:06:55.980> that<00:06:56.130> going<00:06:56.430> to<00:06:56.640> two-and-a-half<00:06:58.160> was

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
finding that going to two-and-a-half was

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.430 
finding that going to two-and-a-half was
actually<00:07:00.300> taking<00:07:00.600> a<00:07:00.690> little<00:07:00.840> bit<00:07:01.050> of<00:07:01.140> traction

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
actually taking a little bit of traction

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.720 
actually taking a little bit of traction
away<00:07:01.770> from<00:07:01.980> the<00:07:02.100> car<00:07:02.310> because<00:07:02.490> you're<00:07:02.580> just

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:02.730 
away from the car because you're just

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.250 
away from the car because you're just
riding<00:07:02.910> on<00:07:03.180> that<00:07:03.450> that<00:07:03.600> player<00:07:03.780> is<00:07:03.900> right<00:07:04.110> on

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
riding on that that player is right on

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.350 
riding on that that player is right on
the<00:07:04.350> inside<00:07:04.650> of<00:07:04.680> the<00:07:04.770> tire<00:07:04.980> and<00:07:05.670> sometimes

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
the inside of the tire and sometimes

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.910 
the inside of the tire and sometimes
that<00:07:06.510> can<00:07:06.630> help<00:07:06.780> I<00:07:06.960> think<00:07:06.990> if<00:07:07.260> your<00:07:07.410> car<00:07:07.620> the

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:07.920 
that can help I think if your car the

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.210 
that can help I think if your car the
front<00:07:08.130> end<00:07:08.250> is<00:07:08.340> sliding<00:07:08.700> too<00:07:09.060> much<00:07:09.290> but<00:07:10.290> at

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
front end is sliding too much but at

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.470 
front end is sliding too much but at
that<00:07:11.460> particular<00:07:11.610> race<00:07:12.030> I<00:07:12.150> don't<00:07:12.180> think<00:07:12.420> the

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
that particular race I don't think the

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.700 
that particular race I don't think the
car<00:07:12.660> was<00:07:12.750> actually<00:07:13.050> sliding<00:07:13.320> too<00:07:13.560> much

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
car was actually sliding too much

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.710 
car was actually sliding too much
actually<00:07:13.920> thing<00:07:14.220> you<00:07:14.310> need<00:07:14.460> to<00:07:14.490> have<00:07:14.730> a<00:07:15.000> little

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
actually thing you need to have a little

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
actually thing you need to have a little
bit<00:07:16.010> more<00:07:17.010> of<00:07:17.070> a<00:07:17.540> up<00:07:18.540> and<00:07:18.810> down<00:07:18.960> camber<00:07:19.440> angle

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 
bit more of a up and down camber angle

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.440 
bit more of a up and down camber angle
like<00:07:19.860> you<00:07:20.040> know<00:07:20.130> one<00:07:20.400> or<00:07:20.580> one<00:07:20.760> I<00:07:20.790> had<00:07:21.030> one<00:07:21.180> point

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.450 
like you know one or one I had one point

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.080 
like you know one or one I had one point
five<00:07:21.690> and<00:07:22.080> I<00:07:23.040> felt<00:07:23.280> like<00:07:23.400> that<00:07:23.460> actually<00:07:23.790> put<00:07:24.060> a

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
five and I felt like that actually put a

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.110 
five and I felt like that actually put a
little<00:07:24.210> more<00:07:24.360> tire<00:07:24.600> on<00:07:24.810> the<00:07:24.900> track<00:07:25.170> and<00:07:25.380> and

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 
little more tire on the track and and

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.650 
little more tire on the track and and
helped<00:07:27.120> the<00:07:27.270> car<00:07:27.680> to<00:07:28.910> steer<00:07:29.910> better<00:07:30.180> because

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 
helped the car to steer better because

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.690 
helped the car to steer better because
you<00:07:31.590> weren't<00:07:31.740> waiting<00:07:31.920> for<00:07:32.190> the<00:07:32.250> car<00:07:32.430> to<00:07:32.460> start

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:32.700 
you weren't waiting for the car to start

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.920 
you weren't waiting for the car to start
sliding<00:07:33.000> or<00:07:33.300> rolling<00:07:33.480> onto<00:07:33.780> the<00:07:34.020> to<00:07:34.380> the<00:07:34.500> tire

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
sliding or rolling onto the to the tire

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.830 
sliding or rolling onto the to the tire
so<00:07:36.930> just<00:07:37.560> a<00:07:37.650> couple<00:07:37.770> of<00:07:37.950> quick<00:07:38.160> things<00:07:38.370> to

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 
so just a couple of quick things to

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.550 
so just a couple of quick things to
mention<00:07:40.280> anyway<00:07:41.280> I<00:07:41.660> think<00:07:42.660> that's<00:07:42.900> all<00:07:43.110> I

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 
mention anyway I think that's all I

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.180 
mention anyway I think that's all I
really<00:07:43.740> have<00:07:43.920> to<00:07:44.010> say<00:07:44.220> it

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.190 
really have to say it

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.250 
really have to say it
you
