00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.150
 due and let's start by preparing 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.489
 all we will need is 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:50.899

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:59.300

00:00:50.899 --> 00:01:01.899
 cut the union and for the chicken we go 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.530
 make thin slices 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.689
 like this in a big fire stove 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.090

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.659

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:27.770
 once it is dissolved 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:30.049

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.999
 will bring to a boil and we will leave 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.039
 boil all this gently during 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:36.679
 five to six thousand and during that time there 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.289
 I do that my rice then we add 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:44.359
