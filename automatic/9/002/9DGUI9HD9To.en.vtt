00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.770 
energies the end of the world the
biggest<00:04:50.639> problem<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:51.150> we<00:04:51.330> don't<00:04:51.660> have

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
biggest problem is that we don't have

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.689 
biggest problem is that we don't have
much<00:04:52.050> information<00:04:52.320> first<00:04:52.979> of<00:04:53.100> all<00:04:53.250> let's<00:04:53.460> take

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
much information first of all let's take

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.570 
much information first of all let's take
it<00:04:54.210> step<00:04:54.479> by<00:04:54.660> step<00:04:54.840> who<00:04:55.289> could<00:04:55.590> be<00:04:55.740> that<00:04:56.009> big<00:04:56.310> of

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
it step by step who could be that big of

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.670 
it step by step who could be that big of
a<00:04:56.610> threat<00:04:56.970> Hydra<00:04:57.720> I<00:04:57.960> doubt<00:04:58.199> it<00:04:58.380> would<00:04:58.500> be

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
a threat Hydra I doubt it would be

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.500 
a threat Hydra I doubt it would be
anyone<00:04:59.010> acting<00:04:59.430> out<00:04:59.550> of<00:04:59.580> greed<00:04:59.910> even<00:05:00.270> Haider

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
anyone acting out of greed even Haider

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.330 
anyone acting out of greed even Haider
wouldn't<00:05:00.900> want<00:05:01.110> an<00:05:01.229> apocalypse<00:05:01.680> well<00:05:02.100> there

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
wouldn't want an apocalypse well there

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.189 
wouldn't want an apocalypse well there
is<00:05:02.460> someone<00:05:02.850> I<00:05:02.880> can<00:05:03.000> think<00:05:03.330> of<00:05:03.539> who<00:05:03.600> wouldn't

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
is someone I can think of who wouldn't

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.260 
is someone I can think of who wouldn't
care<00:05:04.530> about<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.889> consequences<00:05:05.240> Ultron

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
care about the consequences Ultron

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.029 
care about the consequences Ultron
because<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.900> who<00:05:07.050> do<00:05:07.199> you<00:05:07.289> think<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.770> could

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
because the who do you think it could

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.890 
because the who do you think it could
detect<00:05:08.340> Ultron's<00:05:08.789> activity<00:05:09.240> with<00:05:09.389> your<00:05:09.570> radar

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
detect Ultron's activity with your radar

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.960 
detect Ultron's activity with your radar
okay<00:05:10.350> I'll<00:05:10.530> try<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:10.919> have<00:05:11.070> a<00:05:11.100> detected<00:05:11.550> activity

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
okay I'll try I have a detected activity

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.700 
okay I'll try I have a detected activity
that<00:05:12.150> appears<00:05:12.479> to<00:05:12.630> match<00:05:12.780> Ultron's<00:05:13.260> energy

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
that appears to match Ultron's energy

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.650 
that appears to match Ultron's energy
patterns<00:05:14.070> that<00:05:14.400> conformity<00:05:15.030> degree<00:05:15.360> of<00:05:15.510> the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
patterns that conformity degree of the

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.870 
patterns that conformity degree of the
energy<00:05:15.990> patterns<00:05:16.349> is<00:05:16.560> 12%<00:05:17.039> what<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.729> heck

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
energy patterns is 12% what the heck

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.370 
energy patterns is 12% what the heck
does<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.150> even<00:05:18.330> mean<00:05:18.570> I<00:05:18.930> don't<00:05:19.139> know<00:05:19.199> what

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
does that even mean I don't know what

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.810 
does that even mean I don't know what
that<00:05:19.530> means<00:05:19.740> but<00:05:19.860> elet's<00:05:20.099> is<00:05:20.280> something<00:05:20.669> I

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
that means but elet's is something I

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.370 
that means but elet's is something I

alright here we go finally a frickin
mission<00:05:24.750> let's<00:05:25.020> do<00:05:25.289> this<00:05:25.440> Black<00:05:25.740> Widow<00:05:25.979> you

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
mission let's do this Black Widow you

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.290 
mission let's do this Black Widow you
will<00:05:26.310> be<00:05:26.400> first<00:05:26.669> get<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.060> bit<00:05:27.300> different<00:05:27.960> guys

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
will be first get a bit different guys

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.580 
will be first get a bit different guys
catches<00:05:30.300> with<00:05:30.449> some<00:05:30.750> powerful<00:05:30.930> attacks<00:05:31.380> on

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
catches with some powerful attacks on

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.529 
catches with some powerful attacks on
these<00:05:31.770> nobodies<00:05:32.130> okay<00:05:32.669> here<00:05:32.940> we<00:05:33.030> go<00:05:33.060> so<00:05:33.479> I

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
these nobodies okay here we go so I

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.000 
these nobodies okay here we go so I
guess<00:05:33.570> that<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.080> first<00:05:34.110> battle<00:05:34.650> was<00:05:34.740> just

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
guess that the first battle was just

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.219 
guess that the first battle was just
like<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.220> preview<00:05:35.699> of<00:05:35.760> leader<00:05:36.360> levels<00:05:36.840> perhaps

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
like a preview of leader levels perhaps

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.649 
like a preview of leader levels perhaps
take<00:05:37.680> that<00:05:37.919> take<00:05:38.520> my<00:05:38.729> strengths<00:05:39.180> okay<00:05:39.419> this

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
take that take my strengths okay this

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.270 
take that take my strengths okay this
will<00:05:39.810> take<00:05:40.020> me<00:05:40.139> somewhere<00:05:40.320> I<00:05:40.470> suppose<00:05:40.590> looks

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
will take me somewhere I suppose looks

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.580 
will take me somewhere I suppose looks
like<00:05:41.490> a<00:05:41.520> wipey<00:05:41.849> wipey<00:05:42.000> do<00:05:42.720> a<00:05:42.750> little<00:05:43.080> EDD

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
like a wipey wipey do a little EDD
