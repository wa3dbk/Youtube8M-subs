00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
what it can do so let me just spawn a

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.359 
what it can do so let me just spawn a
pig<00:00:14.309> here<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:15.150> as<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.450> saw<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.900> just<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.920> this

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
pig here so as you saw it just it this

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.599 
pig here so as you saw it just it this
can<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:17.880> send<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.449> flying<00:00:18.740> so<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:20.039> can<00:00:20.189> spam

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
can just send it flying so you can spam

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.849 
can just send it flying so you can spam
this<00:00:21.060> cannon<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:21.570> much<00:00:21.779> as<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.140> want<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.560> it's

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
this cannon as much as you want it it's

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.609 
this cannon as much as you want it it's
up<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:24.680> on<00:00:26.029> this<00:00:27.029> case<00:00:27.449> there<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
up to you and on this case there is a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.919 
up to you and on this case there is a
chance<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.849> made<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.210> survival

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
chance that this can be made in survival

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.810 
chance that this can be made in survival
but<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> zero<00:00:32.460> point<00:00:32.700> zero

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
but like it's like a zero point zero

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.810 
but like it's like a zero point zero
zero<00:00:33.030> zero<00:00:33.329> zero<00:00:33.660> zero<00:00:34.200> zero<00:00:34.680> zero<00:00:35.040> one

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
zero zero zero zero zero zero one

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.600 
zero zero zero zero zero zero one
percent<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.840> can<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:38.219> because

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
percent that you can do this but because

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.160 
percent that you can do this but because
like<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.910> mobs<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.750> almost

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
like the mobs like it's almost

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.040 
like the mobs like it's almost
impossible<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:41.340> them<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> get<00:00:42.570> into<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
impossible for them to get into the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.229 
impossible for them to get into the
cannon<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.739> oh<00:00:47.010> my<00:00:47.610> god<00:00:47.789> most

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
cannon so as you can see oh my god most

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.470 
cannon so as you can see oh my god most
of<00:00:48.390> them<00:00:48.539> landed<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.469> Obsidian<00:00:50.070> blocks<00:00:50.480> so

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
of them landed on the Obsidian blocks so

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.130 
of them landed on the Obsidian blocks so
yeah<00:00:51.719> um<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> may<00:00:54.840> fly<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.140> back<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.780> that's<00:00:57.989> why

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
yeah um so may fly it back so that's why

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.770 
yeah um so may fly it back so that's why
it<00:00:58.199> basically<00:00:58.620> looks<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.850> inside<00:01:00.539> there

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
it basically looks like so inside there

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.789 
it basically looks like so inside there
are<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:01.199> cows<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.629> that's<00:01:03.629> those<00:01:04.229> cows<00:01:04.559> are

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
are some cows and that's those cows are

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.820 
are some cows and that's those cows are
what<00:01:05.180> those<00:01:06.180> cows<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> things<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.080> are

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
what those cows are the things that are

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.910 
what those cows are the things that are
sending<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.000> pigs<00:01:09.659> flying<00:01:10.020> though<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> think

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
sending the pigs flying though I think

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.219 
sending the pigs flying though I think
that<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.340> machine<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.570> thing<00:01:13.049> might

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that this machine like this thing might

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.770 
that this machine like this thing might
work<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.010> chickens<00:01:14.640> cuz<00:01:14.939> they<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.360> like

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
work on is chickens cuz they can like

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.039 
work on is chickens cuz they can like
sort<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.259> guess<00:01:16.710> fly<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
sort of I guess fly and this but the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.550 
sort of I guess fly and this but the
other<00:01:19.259> mobs<00:01:19.619> such<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.400> cows<00:01:23.780> okay<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.840> that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
other mobs such as cows okay so that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.010 
other mobs such as cows okay so that
Carol<00:01:25.890> did<00:01:26.100> okay<00:01:26.400> okay<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.270> actually<00:01:27.509> for

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
Carol did okay okay and actually for

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.740 
Carol did okay okay and actually for
some<00:01:28.140> reason<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.549> actually<00:01:29.850> sort<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.270> send

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
some reason it can actually sort of send

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.460 
some reason it can actually sort of send
you<00:01:31.520> okay<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.150> actually<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.780> work<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
you okay so I actually can work on you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.700 
you okay so I actually can work on you
as<00:01:34.680> well<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:37.049> doesn't<00:01:37.290> work<00:01:37.500> as

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
as well but it like it doesn't work as

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.310 
as well but it like it doesn't work as
well<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.930> okay<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.229> cow<00:01:40.409> sent<00:01:41.070> flying<00:01:45.320> so

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
well so okay so that cow sent flying so

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.730 
well so okay so that cow sent flying so
some<00:01:46.890> land<00:01:47.479> around<00:01:48.479> here<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:49.320> some<00:01:49.470> reason

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
some land around here for some reason

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.469 
some land around here for some reason
but<00:01:49.920> um<00:01:51.170> like<00:01:52.170> mostly<00:01:52.970> depends<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.060> how<00:01:54.240> much

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
but um like mostly depends on how much

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.850 
but um like mostly depends on how much
cows<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.530> put<00:01:55.799> as<00:01:56.009> your<00:01:56.210> fuel<00:01:57.439> like<00:01:58.439> it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
cows you put as your fuel like it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.429 
cows you put as your fuel like it
depends<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.520> how<00:01:59.820> much<00:02:00.509> how<00:02:01.380> many

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
depends on that how much how many

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.670 
depends on that how much how many
calfrac<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.640> as<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.939> saw<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.719> it's<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
calfrac so as you saw like it's the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.510 
calfrac so as you saw like it's the
Machine<00:02:04.979> sent<00:02:05.219> me<00:02:05.340> flying<00:02:07.039> so<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.129> depends<00:02:08.399> on

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
Machine sent me flying so it depends on

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.130 
Machine sent me flying so it depends on
how<00:02:08.670> many<00:02:08.849> animals<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.539> pull<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> back

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
how many animals you pull out the back

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.080 
how many animals you pull out the back
on

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
on

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.250 
on
like<00:02:12.900> how<00:02:13.400> far<00:02:14.400> your<00:02:14.610> animals<00:02:14.970> will<00:02:15.269> get<00:02:15.810> be

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
like how far your animals will get be

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.390 
like how far your animals will get be
sent<00:02:16.530> flying<00:02:17.300> like<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.810> yeah<00:02:19.170> um<00:02:19.440> all<00:02:20.040> depends

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
sent flying like so yeah um all depends

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.839 
sent flying like so yeah um all depends
on<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.610> cows<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.040> more<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> put<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
on the cows so the more you put the

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.160 
on the cows so the more you put the
further<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.510> go<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:27.090> I'm<00:02:27.569> trying<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.900> try<00:02:28.110> to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
how to how to build it so you can pick

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.300 
how to how to build it so you can pick
any<00:02:45.569> book<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.900> want<00:02:46.049> besides<00:02:46.709> sand<00:02:47.010> or<00:02:47.160> gravel

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
any book you want besides sand or gravel

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.210 
any book you want besides sand or gravel
first<00:02:47.700> our<00:02:47.910> fold<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.920> some<00:02:49.920> am<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:52.650> basically

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
first our fold and some am so basically

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:12.270 
first our fold and some am so basically
make<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.519> three<00:02:53.880> by<00:02:54.060> five<00:02:55.040> rectangle

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.770 

okay<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:14.020> after<00:03:14.200> you've<00:03:14.530> done<00:03:14.740> that<00:03:15.000> um<00:03:16.000> build

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
okay so after you've done that um build

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.460 
okay so after you've done that um build
three<00:03:17.110> blocks<00:03:17.440> out<00:03:17.680> at<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.520> front<00:03:18.790> so

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
three blocks out at the front so

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.470 
three blocks out at the front so
basically<00:03:20.470> in<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.709> middle<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:21.160> then<00:03:21.970> after

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
basically in the middle and then after

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.940 
basically in the middle and then after
that<00:03:22.660> place<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.980> blocks<00:03:24.790> on<00:03:25.180> top<00:03:25.240> of<00:03:25.780> on<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
that place the blocks on top of on the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.640 
that place the blocks on top of on the
edge<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.700> ones<00:03:27.880> out<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.150> edge<00:03:34.410> okay<00:03:35.410> and

edge the ones out of the edge okay and
then<00:03:35.830> place<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.190> block<00:03:36.489> in<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.760> middle<00:03:37.060> to

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810
