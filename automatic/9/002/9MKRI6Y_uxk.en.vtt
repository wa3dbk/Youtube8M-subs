00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.080
 lescure 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.520
 remember me is a capcom game develop 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.199
 in France by the Parisian studios 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.150
 other notes that their first game is 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.310
 an action adventure game on pc on 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.930
 playstation 3 / xbox is happening in 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.840
 the future in paris or more exactly one 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.760
 neo paris in 2084 is at the center of this 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.050
 story on aniline a young woman who 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.089
 is amnesic we stole her 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.680
 memories and in the sense of the story of 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.030
 remember me as its name indicates it 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.280
 is this whole story of remembrance of 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.930
 memory with a society memories that 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.079
 steals people's memories for purposes 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.079
 commercial 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.770
 then he handed me started playing already 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.120
 it must be remembered it's a beat them 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.199
 all this is a game oriented on 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.239
 fighting obviously there is a story there 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.739
 there is a little exploration but it's 90% 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.540
 we will say about the interest of the game in the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.769
 gameplay it's fighting fights 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.509
 melee that is inspired not bad 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.640
 of batman arkham city to know that this 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.180
 are fights with bare hands with ba 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.899
 pretty mechanical systems of combos 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.820
 interrupted regularly by the 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.320
 need to counter or more exactly 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.090
 to dodge ie when a 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.200
 enemy around you a point 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.610
 exclamation above the head he 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.649
 must be pressed on the cross 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.000
 on playstation to dodge the shot and 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.280
 keep up your combo so that's 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.390
 relatively simple but that's off to 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.649
 adventurous thread because you're going 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.119
 unlock stage loans ie 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.289
 in fact properties that you go 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.070
 put in your combo there is a little 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.780
 complicated I will try to do 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.039
 simple in fact you can choose if 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.479
 your combo will do some damage 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.830
 we will treat you, that is to say we 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.140
 choose and if for example the touch 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.490
 square in the carey carey carey carey va 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.600
 be square or squares care 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.560
 of power so where you can 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.420
 put a few properties that you 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.159
 want to have four in the game a 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.140
 bonus bonus bonus bonus 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.360
 of energy and a multiplier that goes into 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.340
 make bonus office for all 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.619
 other properties that I did not mention 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.600
 it's relatively complex relatively 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.619
 complete one understands easily where I 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.570
 want to get to it unfortunately I find 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.740
 it's still a little bit simple to know 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.090
 that's interesting discovered this 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.170
 system during and first 3 4 hours 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.360
 then we quickly fall in circles 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.380
 always use the same combo is 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.460
 so on it I think the game 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.100
 could have gone further in a small 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.989
 little disappointed in any case on the end of the game 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.640
 for this system of combat and combos 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.390
 configurable but overall need the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.440
 to point out it's something quite 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.440
 unique to remember me 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.049
 so obviously we can talk about 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.580
 remember me not to mention his direction 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.769
 artistic more generally of the 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.110
 proposition that is made around neo 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.180
 paris this city since 2000 84 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.760
 futuristic half in ruins because 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.530
 that it was destroyed meanwhile that has 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.940
 been proposed by other modes me I 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.129
 I'll be very frank it's really nice 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.120
 the sets that are proposed is a 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.440
 game that is very visually generous 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.209
 that is, the game is rather 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.040
 fluid more togo there are a lot of 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.930
 details and no decor that was 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.010
 duplicate ie that there is 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.420
 many colors obviously but do not 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.819
 are not all alike there is really 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.349
 a desire to go for originality 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.370
 in the scenery never recomposed 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.290
 twice the same environment 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.940
 so we're going for a walk on the roofs of 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.319
 paris and futurist obviously in the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.629
 paris metro futurism gaps are 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.549
 despite everything at our Paris metro and 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.430
 in a lot of places more or less 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.530
 familiar with 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.090
 Parisian walker so here it is 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.560
 facades that can be recognized from 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.879
 color architectures of the bric it 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.650
 kind of things it seems a little bit 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.670
 familiar so here is there a real 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.159
 want to go get a direction 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.540
 quite unique artistic far away eventually 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.530
 American or Japanese cannons 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.120
 can have right and left 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.200
 this is something that I really 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.859
 technically appreciated it's rather 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.780
 solid in any case the version 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.450
 playstation 3 shot very well this is a 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.769
 beautiful game a beautiful french game with also 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.780
 a character design that has the merit in 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.489
 any case try something 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.439
 so it's really I find a beautiful 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.950
 game with a real good direction 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.720
 artistic 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.250
 my only regret 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.050
 is that our remember me finally the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.190
 game is very linear the sets are 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.720
 very little permissive ie 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.070
 can climb but only to 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.380
 places indicated by the game with 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.570
 yellow arrows so no way finally 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.070
 to get on the roof of the city to get 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.450
 stroll the neighborhoods as we 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.400
 wish it's not an open world it's 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.840
 really a hallway game with some 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.640
 chapters that are delineated with a 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.110
 beginning an end and a cutscene at 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.370
 middle so the structure of the game and 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.690
 maybe a little disappointing the game of 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.220
 head lacks a little ambition of this 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.840
 point of view there in any case it's nice to 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.290
 look and for once and this is a 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.580
 quality 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.740
 remember me does not look like others 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.370
 action games released on consoles of 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.370
 salon this year 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.510
 on the other hand small or even a big box 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.370
 yellow for the story of remember me 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.169
 I expected many things 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.549
 especially because at the origin of this 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.530
 history we have an amazigh who is a 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.560
 recognized author of the literature of 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.699
 science fiction and yet I have to 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.840
 to say things very bluntly I was 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.770
 very disappointed by the story I find 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.479
 not interesting 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.270
 the elements were there yet we are 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.010
 at the magnificent bet the whole story of 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.570
 flight the memory of modification of 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.949
 memories of amnesic ninine who is going 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.050
 search his past his identity 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.110
 possibly the moral ambiguity the 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.580
 thinking precisely about the morality of 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.900
 actions ni line and about stealing 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.040
 memories or change memories 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.110
 to people she is nasty 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.850
 or no, it's something 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.590
 which is quite ambiguous in this story 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.600
 is however never evoked very 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.220
 clear 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.580
 we all we have is a girl who 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.200
 fate of his amnesia that makes kung fu 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.310
 and who will kill monsters because 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.080
 she has a big heart a beautiful soul 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.240
 and finally she has no more 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.400
 motivation that the bosses people are talking about a 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.450
 passing caricatures to the possible I'm going 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.660
 not quote you the replicas 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.010
 I leave you the surprise but it's I 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.020
 find it really badly written what 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.580
 the robots that feel the valves the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.720
 wicked one is a villain who does not 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.610
 form a kind of combat aircraft 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.410
 leave attack he takes out a poem 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.640
 while he knows how to kill him is a scholar 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.670
 crazy who is completely crazy but kind 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.810
 at the most basic level of things 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.190
 finally here it is a casting that comes 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.860
 Dorothee club is really not 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.730
 super interesting for whom for that 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.620
 who has already read a little bit of 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.640
 sf literature and that over 18 years ago 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.100
 just honestly I find 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.900
 that it is a scenario for children 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.160
 for teenagers it's not going much 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.260
 higher up the elements were there 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.640
 yet I do not understand the dialogues 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.570
 in addition to the French version good there 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.740
 on it we do not all agree 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.310
 writing but I'm not convinced 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.050
 by the vf 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.190
 so that's the story is not going to interest 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.420
 again it's a beat them all 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.040
 levi flights are not always 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.260
 interesting at the story level in the 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.030
 quiz bayonetta bim ares i domain are 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.470
 not necessarily references yet 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.960
 not sometimes some enemies and mijoux 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.100
 and so you must not buy remember 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.660
 it for its history contrary to this 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.070
 that certain elements of communication 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.090
 some men have been able to believe 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.140
 it's not a game that's more 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.330
 intelligent than others because he 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.300
 tackles futuristic themes on it at 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.400
 side deus ex it's celine so here it is 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.870
 it's a game the action what makes 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.230
 action he does it right but 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.880
 the story 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.740
 personally all the ambiguities 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.450
 moral of nini etc i did not believe at all 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.080
 the characters are missed and so there 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.080
 above we recommend it 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.379
 so remember me is probably not the 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.490
 game of the year but it's not either 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:27.990
 a bad game it's a game that has me 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.610
 pleasantly surprised i'm going i'm going 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.889
 France very it's a game that I liked 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.409
 I liked to finish I played a little 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.780
 dozen hours and I must say that this 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.889
 he does in action rather pleased me 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.360
 I am rather clients we will say 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.680
 Batman fights to the system 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.240
 parametric combos some will not like 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.039
 not the Japanese school of pullet by 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.599
 example is that it is not necessarily its 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.620
 cam 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.090
 nevertheless here I would like to point out a 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.620
 quite remarkable work on the 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.030
 artistic direction I think that's where 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.190
 above the game is worth a look on the 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.419
 weight at a high price but for fans of 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.069
 science fiction it can be interesting 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.930
 to have this universe a bit cyberpunk 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.009
 we will discover in neo paris but 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.870
 only regret finally not I say them 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:02.550
 it's about the story that plays finds 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.810
 is not at the level and on the universe 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.740
 more generally ie that beats 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.210
 all doors are closed one can 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.280
 never returned to the stores the NPCs 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.659
 down does not speak already he has very little and 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.789
 when we often gave up talking robot 

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:13.650
 no we see it's a pretty empty world 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:16.349
 pretty hollow I think other modes 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.030
 could have used a little more time 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:19.379
 and ways to improve his game 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.610
 I hope for a sequel 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:22.530
 there is the potential but clearly is going 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.909
 not far enough in this world that we have 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.400
 want to re discover so anyway 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:28.469
 a recommendable purchase may not be 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.490
 now maybe not at this price but 

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:31.490
 to watch for action fans 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:37.830
 it 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.830
 sad record
