00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:07.129
 hi these are the two tricks they 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.460
 we are going to teach today the first 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.800
 is the egg trick that need a 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.150
 half liter bottle 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.330
 the container with the yolk and the clear and 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.330
 a small container to find what 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.119
 has to do is press the part of 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.579
 down the half liter bottle to 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:34.850
 that sucks then this is the first thing 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:38.899
 carefully put it on the yolk and 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.460
 suck then transfer it 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:47.890
 carefully to the illicit potes 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:52.440
 and so we separate the yolks from the white 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.440
 now comes the trick of the coin 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.610
 hello friends and pretty trick 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.310
 Today I'm going to show you how the 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.780
 trick of the coin 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.770
 the ingredients are 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.390
 or things are a bottle with water 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.810
 for stability 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.720
 a strip of paper of three centimeters 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:20.210
 by 13 centimeters long and here 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.850
 we have 600 760 pesos that are coins 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.190
 100 coin of 10 a coin of 50 and a 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.110
 presentation 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.130
 I the trick is 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.070
 and take out the paper 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.950
 move the coin 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.030
 we place the paper 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.030
 we place the 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.460
 760 pesos 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.159
 and now how we get the paper without moving 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.979
 no easy coin 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:59.009
 we stretch the paper and hit 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.009
 strong and the currency does not hurt
