00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
all night for an exam you've known about

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.590 
all night for an exam you've known about
for<00:00:04.170> at<00:00:04.230> least<00:00:04.500> two<00:00:04.859> months<00:00:05.040> or<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:06.210> enjoy

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
for at least two months or you enjoy

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.570 
for at least two months or you enjoy
heart<00:00:06.960> palpitation<00:00:07.529> either<00:00:07.680> way<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.429> need

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
heart palpitation either way you need

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.720 
heart palpitation either way you need
caffeine<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.420> using<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.840> yeah<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.950> which<00:00:11.429> is

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
caffeine and using it yeah so which is

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.890 
caffeine and using it yeah so which is
it<00:00:12.000> light<00:00:12.570> roast<00:00:13.099> roast<00:00:14.099> which<00:00:14.519> has<00:00:14.759> more<00:00:15.630> zing

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
it light roast roast which has more zing

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.550 
it light roast roast which has more zing
a<00:00:19.789> common<00:00:20.789> thought<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.750> dark<00:00:22.050> roast<00:00:22.320> has

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
a common thought is that dark roast has

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560 
a common thought is that dark roast has
more<00:00:22.769> caffeine<00:00:23.010> because<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.699> appears<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.539> be

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
more caffeine because it appears to be

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.920 
more caffeine because it appears to be
more<00:00:24.930> dense<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.160> if<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.640> ask<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.970> specialist

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
more dense and if you ask a specialist

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.500 
more dense and if you ask a specialist
they'll<00:00:28.590> say<00:00:28.740> light<00:00:29.160> roast<00:00:29.460> because<00:00:30.060> dark

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
they'll say light roast because dark

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.820 
they'll say light roast because dark
roast<00:00:30.720> would<00:00:30.929> be<00:00:31.080> more<00:00:31.199> caffeine<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
roast would be more caffeine in the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.190 
roast would be more caffeine in the
roasting<00:00:32.250> process<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.300> neither<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:34.050> these

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
roasting process but neither of these

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.060 
roasting process but neither of these
are<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> full<00:00:35.190> truth<00:00:35.670> let<00:00:36.540> science<00:00:37.070> explain

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
are the full truth let science explain

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.920 
are the full truth let science explain
during<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.610> roasting<00:00:38.940> process<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.450> caffeine

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
during the roasting process the caffeine

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.350 
during the roasting process the caffeine
content<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> beans<00:00:40.829> barely<00:00:41.610> changes<00:00:42.149> at

content of the beans barely changes at

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
content of the beans barely changes at
all<00:00:42.390> well<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.260> seems<00:00:43.620> reasonable<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.489> heat

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
all well it seems reasonable that heat

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.180 
all well it seems reasonable that heat
would<00:00:45.120> cause<00:00:45.390> caffeine<00:00:45.989> destruction<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
would cause caffeine destruction the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.709 
would cause caffeine destruction the
roasting<00:00:47.700> temperature<00:00:48.149> would<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
roasting temperature would have to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.340 
roasting temperature would have to
exceed<00:00:49.050> 600<00:00:49.680> degrees<00:00:50.550> Fahrenheit<00:00:51.350> most

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350

start off small and green as they head
into<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> grocery<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:08.130> good<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> think<00:01:08.549> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
into the grocery it's good to think of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
into the grocery it's good to think of
this<00:01:08.729> roasting<00:01:09.270> process<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.869> similar<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
this roasting process as similar to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.550 
this roasting process as similar to
popping<00:01:11.670> popcorn<00:01:12.180> after<00:01:13.140> about<00:01:13.320> eight

minutes in the roaster the beings will

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.539 
minutes in the roaster the beings will
begin<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.810> pop<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.920> when<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.189> they

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
begin to pop and when they do they

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.090 
begin to pop and when they do they
increase<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:17.970> size<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.930> they<00:01:19.350> begin<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> brown

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
increase in size as they begin to brown

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.420 
increase in size as they begin to brown

about<00:01:23.790> ten<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.509> twelve<00:01:24.540> minutes<00:01:25.409> into<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
about ten or twelve minutes into the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.920 
about ten or twelve minutes into the
roast<00:01:26.100> which<00:01:26.790> signals<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> bean<00:01:27.689> has

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
roast which signals that the bean has

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.830 
roast which signals that the bean has
been<00:01:28.080> fully<00:01:28.500> roasted<00:01:29.220> however<00:01:29.759> Roasters<00:01:30.659> can

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
been fully roasted however Roasters can

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.050 
been fully roasted however Roasters can
remove<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> beans<00:01:31.439> earlier<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.610> achieve<00:01:32.909> a

so<00:02:02.500> when<00:02:02.650> brewing<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:03.040> cup<00:02:03.220> of<00:02:03.340> coffee

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
so when brewing a cup of coffee

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.730 
so when brewing a cup of coffee
if<00:02:03.940> scoops<00:02:04.450> are<00:02:04.690> used<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.140> measure<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.530> beans

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
if scoops are used to measure the beans

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.460 
if scoops are used to measure the beans
then<00:02:06.430> a<00:02:06.700> light<00:02:07.060> roast<00:02:07.270> beans<00:02:07.600> will<00:02:07.780> fit<00:02:08.140> into<00:02:08.350> a

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
then a light roast beans will fit into a

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.010 
then a light roast beans will fit into a
scoop<00:02:08.950> therefore<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.759> scoop<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.509> light<00:02:10.840> roast

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
scoop therefore a scoop of light roast

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.670 
scoop therefore a scoop of light roast
beans<00:02:11.380> will<00:02:11.950> yield<00:02:12.250> more<00:02:12.850> caffeinated<00:02:13.480> coffee

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
beans will yield more caffeinated coffee

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.560 
beans will yield more caffeinated coffee
however<00:02:14.680> if<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.490> beans<00:02:15.730> are<00:02:15.970> being<00:02:16.239> measured

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
however if the beans are being measured

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.960 
however if the beans are being measured
by<00:02:16.780> weights<00:02:17.230> more<00:02:17.860> dark<00:02:18.250> bro<00:02:18.400> experience<00:02:18.790> will

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
by weights more dark bro experience will

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.150 
by weights more dark bro experience will
be<00:02:19.090> included<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.020> therefore<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.590> dark<00:02:20.920> roast

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160
