00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.510
 follow from now tips 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.140
 coloring and how to let the hair 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.140
 more silky and soft glossy dyed 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.400
 if what is being asked for more in the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.070
 sensation of the year is coloration or 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.050
 lights on in the summer they come hard 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.810
 total is everyone who whiten hair 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.480
 in tunes usually the songs are 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.080
 which is more made of the hall the lights them 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.050
 received less than tincture, not they 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.730
 receive more because the lights are 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.100
 made with a decolorant on the holding 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.160
 of the theme a higher percentage of 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.899
 ammonium ammonia then she racked wire 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.270
 so it's actually grid but this movie 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.340
 then becomes more dry with lights and 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.430
 for example decided to make a 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.199
 coloring and dislike the result she 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.969
 has a minimum time to apply 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.460
 again how it works 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.680
 if you lightened your hair and did not like it 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.140
 want to give a darkened it is easy to do 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.460
 now if you choose your profile and want 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.900
 give a clear and have to give a 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.210
 analyzed we have to take time 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.520
 there because what will be done to 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.070
 think and even own hair gives a gun 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.700
 self-regenerate how to 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.079
 keep the brightness of the lights is enough 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.759
 treatment that helps maintain this 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.409
 brightness but what is widely used in 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.659
 salon when the client is with the hair 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.970
 duller has lights is the color wash 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.920
 toner gives you a salad on the wire is 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.350
 colorless toners that are 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.450
 only to brighten any 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.680
 difference between wicks made with 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.290
 paper is or touches the first 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.869
 playing there it hurts more still it hurts more 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.399
 and the cap we do not have an exact notion 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.869
 Where are we taking this wick? 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.430
 because the hair is all pulled back 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.829
 is to put of this class 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.869
 so we're going with needle is pulling the 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.869
 people do not have an exact notion of 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.520
 People are picking up the paper. 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.799
 aluminum is different than the process 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.810
 more correctly then more rigorous so 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.119
 some chickens exactly where it was 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.280
 exactly what I 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.710
 I'll give okay where I want to create more 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.300
 where you want to clear from - so I can 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.090
 balance this issue well 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.630
 and for smoothing it is ideal to do 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.070
 art coloring and lights before or 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.620
 after 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.450
 this question of straightening is also 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.760
 relative you have to analyze the wire well 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.190
 which has quite a fifth that is not 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.830
 it is compatible with smoothing then 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.740
 Oh I always advise that person will 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.470
 to smooth does not lighten to the thread always leave 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.870
 natural hair or at most in the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.850
 natural tone does not vary always use 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.830
 a toner does not use anything with ammonia 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.710
 because it may be that straightening does not 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.630
 to be compatible with the mother obliged 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.240
 Now let's do a brief break. 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.800
 you can not miss an interview so 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.980
 Expected with the singer and composer 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.580
 Oswaldo Montenegro does not leave the front 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.750
 TV 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.750
 We'll be back soon.
