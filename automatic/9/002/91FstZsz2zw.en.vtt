ten hours and I believe an hour and GT a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.219 
ten hours and I believe an hour and GT a
time<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.820> two<00:02:00.090> minutes<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.509> real<00:02:00.689> life<00:02:00.869> times

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
time is two minutes in real life times

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.749

you've got one minute left or one hour
left<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.510> guess<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> special<00:02:28.590> crate

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
left I guess for the the special crate

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.039 
left I guess for the the special crate
drop<00:02:29.069> before<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.489> drops<00:02:30.180> onto<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> map<00:02:30.720> and

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
drop before it drops onto the map and

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.110 
drop before it drops onto the map and
you<00:02:31.379> can<00:02:31.769> pause<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.280> game<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.760> go<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.000> your

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
you can pause the game you go to your

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.670 
you can pause the game you go to your
map<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.360> you'll<00:02:33.690> look<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.290> will<00:02:34.440> see<00:02:34.650> a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
map and you'll look and you will see a

to this green circle or the special
crate<00:03:01.110> drop<00:03:01.670> if<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:03.569> well<00:03:03.870> some<00:03:04.079> people<00:03:04.170> will

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
crate drop if it well some people will

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.569 
crate drop if it well some people will
have<00:03:04.500> helicopters<00:03:04.739> too<00:03:05.129> people<00:03:05.400> know<00:03:05.489> about

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
have helicopters too people know about

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.789 
have helicopters too people know about
this<00:03:05.849> method<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.780> will<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.410> most<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
this method but you will be most the

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.050 
this method but you will be most the
people<00:03:08.099> there<00:03:08.250> unless<00:03:08.519> there's<00:03:08.579> somebody

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
people there unless there's somebody

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.880 
people there unless there's somebody
just<00:03:09.450> already<00:03:09.750> over<00:03:10.079> there<00:03:10.230> yeah<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.680> was<00:03:10.769> my

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
just already over there yeah that was my

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.710 
just already over there yeah that was my
case<00:03:10.980> that's<00:03:11.430> why<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.610> doesn't<00:03:11.760> work<00:03:11.910> 100%<00:03:12.209> of

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
case that's why it doesn't work 100% of

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.140 
case that's why it doesn't work 100% of
the<00:03:12.810> time<00:03:13.019> because<00:03:13.379> sometimes<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:14.250> spawns<00:03:14.910> in

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the time because sometimes it spawns in

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.270 
the time because sometimes it spawns in
where<00:03:15.780> people<00:03:16.230> are<00:03:16.380> already<00:03:16.799> at<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.220> those

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
where people are already at and those

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.009 
where people are already at and those
are<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.519> lucky<00:03:17.730> people<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.359> once<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.840> crate

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
are just lucky people so once the crate

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.440 
are just lucky people so once the crate
drops<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:20.100> want<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.519> just<00:03:20.760> go<00:03:20.910> over<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.299> that

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
do every time I end up getting killed

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.900 
do every time I end up getting killed
but<00:03:37.650> sometimes<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.310> can<00:03:38.459> kill<00:03:38.609> off<00:03:38.760> these

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
but sometimes you can kill off these

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.580 
but sometimes you can kill off these
people<00:03:39.239> win<00:03:39.359> this<00:03:39.510> gang<00:03:39.720> attack<00:03:40.049> too<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.500> then
