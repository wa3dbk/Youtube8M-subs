five to twenty five silver per run and
the<00:03:17.650> nice<00:03:17.799> thing<00:03:17.829> about<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.579> is<00:03:18.819> that<00:03:19.000> you

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
the nice thing about it is is that you

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.530

you have control over you know what your
expected<00:03:23.019> result<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.920> stick<00:03:24.639> to<00:03:24.760> your

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
expected result is you stick to your

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.500 
expected result is you stick to your
prices<00:03:26.069> versus<00:03:27.069> doing<00:03:27.880> some<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.359> other

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
prices versus doing some of the other

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.210 
prices versus doing some of the other
things<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:28.930> I've<00:03:29.109> been<00:03:29.260> making<00:03:29.440> videos<00:03:29.620> on

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
things that I've been making videos on

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.199 
things that I've been making videos on
like<00:03:30.519> buying<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:32.190> loot<00:03:33.190> bags<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:33.849> opening

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
like buying the loot bags and opening

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.640 
like buying the loot bags and opening
them<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:34.569> hoping<00:03:34.930> there's<00:03:35.170> something<00:03:35.410> in

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
them and hoping there's something in

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.960 
them and hoping there's something in
them<00:03:35.769> that's<00:03:35.950> where<00:03:36.519> you're<00:03:36.670> going<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.849> make

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
them that's where you're going to make

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.460 
them that's where you're going to make
us<00:03:37.150> piece<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.660> silver<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.730> think<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:39.849> is<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
us piece of silver to I think this is a

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.659 
us piece of silver to I think this is a
better<00:03:41.470> approach<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.849> consistent<00:03:43.920> income<00:03:44.920> a

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.150 

couple<00:03:48.669> of<00:03:48.760> pointers<00:03:49.380> I've<00:03:50.380> noticed<00:03:50.829> and<00:03:51.069> I'm

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
couple of pointers I've noticed and I'm

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.550 
couple of pointers I've noticed and I'm
not<00:03:51.700> really<00:03:51.940> sure<00:03:52.060> why<00:03:52.510> but<00:03:52.780> when<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:52.989> put<00:03:53.319> in<00:03:53.440> an

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
not really sure why but when I put in an

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.990 
not really sure why but when I put in an
order<00:03:53.769> for<00:03:54.359> 250<00:03:55.359> say<00:03:55.720> green<00:03:55.989> wood<00:03:56.169> logs<00:03:56.910> at<00:03:57.910> a

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
order for 250 say green wood logs at a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.420 
order for 250 say green wood logs at a
certain<00:03:58.180> price<00:03:58.419> then<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.810> have<00:03:58.959> another<00:03:59.430> by

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
certain price then I have another by

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.170 
certain price then I have another by
order<00:04:00.790> at<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:00.940> hundred<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:03.400> same<00:04:03.609> price<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
order at a hundred the same price the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.470 
order at a hundred the same price the
100<00:04:04.720> will<00:04:04.870> fill<00:04:05.109> in<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.380> 251<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.669> I<00:04:07.150> really

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
100 will fill in the 251 and I really

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.430 
100 will fill in the 251 and I really
don't<00:04:07.660> know<00:04:07.810> what<00:04:08.849> is

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
don't know what is

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.270 
don't know what is
catalyst<00:04:11.440> behind<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:12.069> but<00:04:12.400> I've<00:04:12.940> actually

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
catalyst behind that but I've actually

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.039 
catalyst behind that but I've actually
cancelled<00:04:15.280> by<00:04:15.520> orders<00:04:15.910> for<00:04:16.090> 250<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:16.780> put<00:04:16.959> them

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
cancelled by orders for 250 and put them

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.810 
cancelled by orders for 250 and put them
in<00:04:17.170> for<00:04:17.380> 100<00:04:17.829> or<00:04:17.950> 200<00:04:19.049> because<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.200> it<00:04:20.820> I've

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820

in for 100 or 200 because of it I've
also<00:04:22.090> noticed<00:04:22.480> that<00:04:23.910> when<00:04:24.910> there<00:04:25.150> are<00:04:25.330> buy

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540

it's<00:06:33.800> down<00:06:34.070> to<00:06:34.430> copper<00:06:34.910> I<00:06:35.120> think<00:06:35.390> I'll<00:06:35.690> buy<00:06:35.870> a

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
it's down to copper I think I'll buy a

it's down to copper I think I'll buy a
thousand<00:06:36.500> and<00:06:36.620> create<00:06:36.950> some<00:06:37.100> ingots<00:06:37.430> and<00:06:38.050> if<00:06:39.050> I

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
thousand and create some ingots and if I

thousand and create some ingots and if I
don't<00:06:39.320> need<00:06:39.470> the<00:06:39.620> income<00:06:39.770> from<00:06:40.010> it<00:06:40.370> I'll<00:06:40.820> build

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
don't need the income from it I'll build

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:55.659 
don't need the income from it I'll build
a<00:06:41.150> house<00:06:41.330> from<00:06:41.570> them<00:06:41.870> or<00:06:41.960> something

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 
so if this run had been a thousand

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.570 
so if this run had been a thousand
rawhide<00:07:01.040> instead<00:07:02.040> of<00:07:02.419> 150<00:07:03.419> I<00:07:03.600> would<00:07:03.900> have<00:07:04.020> made

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580
