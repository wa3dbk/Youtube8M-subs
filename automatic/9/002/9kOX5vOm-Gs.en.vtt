00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.530
 me son were made well then all 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.360
 guys we're fifa blatters in this 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.700
 new episode of buying and selling boys 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.130
 we used as a bedimo player 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.230
 guys a player who will give us a 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.260
 nice nest egg of credits for those who are not 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.240
 even for those who still have you guys 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 this was part of the area but 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.949
 it will cost 600 and we make a couple of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.140
 offers from ok until we do twenty 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.910
 to offer fifteen offers and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.680
 let's see how many he could think of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.899
 that I will succeed think 67 because anyway 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:47.039
 he is not a fairly followed player 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:50.399
 here it is here 94 which is not bad it goes 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.600
 very well with the principles of disregard 9 that 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.000
 we're going to put all almost 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.920
 market has as many as 700 youngsters 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.829
 then a square of 100 credits which 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.049
 to start is not bad bedino here it is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.299
 here guys put it at 720 that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.740
 obviously we don't shoot because of that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.479
 at least we resell it immediately and then there 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.340
 we want to earn those 50 credits in 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.460
 but wait an hour longer 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.990
 Well I honestly decide for the half 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.400
 seven hundred however at least the first one 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.470
 moment 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:26.090
 and here is a terrible split third 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.090
 pÃ¨rimo we are waiting for this one 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.070
 let's also put this another let's say that 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.380
 this method includes doing 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.689
 enough there is enough work well 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.579
 and I also recommend a timetable for doing so 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.119
 because this is not done at all times 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:44.119
 this method but means it is done in 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.740
 from 6 to 7 when there is none at all 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.060
 to anyone because even doing a 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.689
 calculation even friends are not 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.000
 seven 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.850
 and here are guys like we can see 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.409
 we sold all our came 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.530
 guys then this method we can 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.329
