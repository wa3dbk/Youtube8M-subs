00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.690
 if you are thinking of undergoing a 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.629
 rhinoplasty the prominent surgeon 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.240
 augusto arriola explains what is the 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.500
 process that you must follow to have the 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.500
 profile dreamed 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.869
 rhinoplasty is a surgery that is 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.220
 intended to be a morphological change of 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.070
 the nose this is the external form and is 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.629
 aimed at getting the concepts of 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.060
 current beauty that are dictated by 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.910
 the 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.880
 to western culture and that consists 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.910
 in slightly lower the back of the nose 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.430
 leave it straight or slightly curved and 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.530
 lift the tip lightly by 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.060
 course also in some cases 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.780
 take advantage to correct some defect 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.340
 physiological function of respiration 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.160
 good in general this surgery applies 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.110
 for men and women not age is a 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.850
 important point that has already been 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.340
 discussed about a decade ago 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.990
 because in the past it was thought that 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.540
 They should be operated after 18 years 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.460
 henceforth already done studies 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.940
 pertinent anatomical and has 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.790
 determined that 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.100
 a patient is male or female with 14 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.260
 years up can already performed the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.770
 surgeries now one wonders and what is 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.100
 the importance of this is very simple no 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.369
 there is no surgery that gives us happiness 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 then if a patient before with the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.840
 old concept was operated from the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.970
 18 and now appeals at 14 that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.190
 patient will have four more years of 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.310
 a better self-esteem and a life more in 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.310
 it's something that has no comparative point 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.070
 I do not have 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.070
 A) Yes 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.869
 there is a type of surgery for each 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.909
 patient because it depends on the pathology 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.310
 that you may have of the alterations 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.009
 morphological can have or desire the 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.560
 patient then a clear example of 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.620
 this is when a patient and already operated 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.420
 a nose and did not like the result 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.819
 then you definitely have to do 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.160
 a plastic exordium consisting of a 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.500
 external sensation in the area of ​​the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.630
 column another clear example is that 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.099
 patient that says doctor I do not want 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.930
 to do anything to me on the tip of henna 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.630
 just as it is, just remove me and the 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.060
 surgeon must respect that desire because 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.549
 is the patient looking for that result and 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.580
 you have to keep it there is also the 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.170
 patient that says doctor me in addition to 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.700
 change in the external way I want 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.709
 improve the function of means because the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.540
 right thing is always covered very 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.519
 well then a ring is made or I accept 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.680
 plastic that modifies the shape and 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.130
 inside we also modify the function of 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.130
 this nose 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.310
 this surgery 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.320
 underestimated in our midst 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.200
 they treat it as if we were to operate 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.940
 help make surgery so serious 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.130
 how to operate an appendix a vesicle by 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.480
 so we need to do exams 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.920
 auxiliary blood and heart 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.140
 specifically in this type of surgeries 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.210
 we are very exhaustive in the sense of 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.130
 see what the coagulation profile is 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.140
 of filippa definitive so that the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.600
 patient with all the elements 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.210
 under control 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.310
 and of course the surgical risk that 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.750
 is the cardiology test to be 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.750
 sure that the heart is 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.810
 before surgery the patient must 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.180
 do a search for a surgeon 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.489
 plastic that are the ones that are dedicated to 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.980
 this type of surgeries are we the 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.900
 that we modify the nose and it 's like 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.150
 when one is going to operate from the uterus or 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.739
 ovary looking for a gynecologist if not 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.840
 has operated on the gallbladder or puncture in 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.849
 general if one is going to be operated the analysis 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.470
 you have to find a plastic surgeon and 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.139
 consequently he has to look for one 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.950
 that has all the accreditations 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.169
 university which is the diploma 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.669
 university that accredits him as 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.360
 It has been a university course 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.259
 training 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.819
 then a membership to a society that 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.259
 was for example to social but it is not 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:34.840
 plastic surgery Brazilian society 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.219
 that by the fact of demanding some 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.319
 much higher standards 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:42.120
 makes the patient have a 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:42.120
 confidence when operating with this doctor
