00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
it works and if you see it freezes the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.270 
it works and if you see it freezes the
day<00:00:50.210> is<00:00:50.600> pretty<00:00:50.900> so<00:00:51.170> frozen<00:00:53.470> if<00:00:54.470> I<00:00:54.710> touch<00:00:55.010> this

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
day is pretty so frozen if I touch this

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.040 
day is pretty so frozen if I touch this
little<00:00:55.550> part<00:00:55.910> right<00:00:55.970> here<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:59.510> white<00:00:59.780> thing

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
little part right here the white thing

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.530 
little part right here the white thing
disappears<00:01:00.710> for<00:01:01.100> some<00:01:01.340> reason<00:01:01.820> I<00:01:02.059> know<00:01:02.239> what's

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
disappears for some reason I know what's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.920 
disappears for some reason I know what's
wrong<00:01:02.780> with<00:01:02.840> this<00:01:03.170> part<00:01:03.970> so<00:01:04.970> should<00:01:05.540> I<00:01:05.630> change

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
wrong with this part so should I change

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.260 
wrong with this part so should I change
the<00:01:06.170> whole<00:01:06.350> screen<00:01:06.710> or<00:01:09.399> why<00:01:10.399> what<00:01:10.970> do<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.149> guys

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
the whole screen or why what do you guys

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.950 
the whole screen or why what do you guys
think

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.150 

you<00:01:14.960> see<00:01:15.170> I<00:01:15.580> bent<00:01:16.580> a<00:01:16.880> little<00:01:16.970> bit<00:01:17.270> this<00:01:17.570> part

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
you see I bent a little bit this part

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.980 
you see I bent a little bit this part
and<00:01:19.960> then<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:20.990> works<00:01:21.350> perfectly

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
and then it works perfectly

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.859 
and then it works perfectly
just<00:01:23.990> by<00:01:24.140> bending<00:01:24.470> this<00:01:24.860> part<00:01:25.160> but<00:01:25.399> if<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.869> leave

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
just by bending this part but if I leave

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.310 
just by bending this part but if I leave
it<00:01:28.119> then<00:01:29.119> it<00:01:29.270> doesn't<00:01:29.300> work<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:29.960> see<00:01:30.170> my

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
it then it doesn't work you see my

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.060 
it then it doesn't work you see my
finger<00:01:30.710> over<00:01:30.830> here<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:33.350> hour<00:01:33.500> doesn't

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
finger over here and the hour doesn't

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.320 
finger over here and the hour doesn't
move<00:01:34.250> because<00:01:34.640> it's<00:01:34.820> frozen<00:01:36.580> unless<00:01:37.580> I<00:01:37.729> I<00:01:38.000> hold

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
move because it's frozen unless I I hold

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.190 
move because it's frozen unless I I hold
this<00:01:38.479> part<00:01:41.200> then<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.350> works<00:01:43.900> hope<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:45.020> guys

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200

so thank you very much I was thinking
about<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.979> inverter<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.909> power<00:01:53.150> better<00:01:53.570> but

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
about the inverter the power better but

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.160 
about the inverter the power better but
uh<00:01:54.530> I<00:01:54.950> don't<00:01:55.460> think<00:01:55.670> so

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
uh I don't think so

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.040
