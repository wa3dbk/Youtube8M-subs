tips<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.820> tricks<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.420> let's<00:00:27.779> take<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> look

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
tips and tricks so let's take a look

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.650 
tips and tricks so let's take a look
alright<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> really

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
alright so here we have a really

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.659 
alright so here we have a really
colorful<00:00:31.109> image<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.890> want<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> talk<00:00:32.369> about

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
colorful image and I want to talk about

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.100 
colorful image and I want to talk about
how<00:00:32.820> we're<00:00:32.940> going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> adjust<00:00:33.480> those<00:00:33.660> colors

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
how we're going to adjust those colors

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.160 
how we're going to adjust those colors
the<00:00:35.030> hue/saturation<00:00:36.030> adjustment<00:00:36.120> layer<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the hue/saturation adjustment layer is a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.600 
the hue/saturation adjustment layer is a
great<00:00:37.590> way<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.160> it's

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
great way to do that it's

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.220 
great way to do that it's
non-destructive<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.420> anything<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.079> do

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
non-destructive so anything that we do

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.740 
non-destructive so anything that we do
here<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.920> turned<00:00:41.129> off<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.510> can

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
here can be turned off and on so I can

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.270 
here can be turned off and on so I can
pull<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.020> saturation<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.160> can

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
pull the saturation and we can

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.830 
pull the saturation and we can
desaturate<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.450> saturate<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> image<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.840> I

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
desaturate or saturate the image and I

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.229 
desaturate or saturate the image and I
can<00:00:48.989> pull<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> hue<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> you'll<00:00:50.700> see<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.059> all

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
can pull the hue and you'll see that all

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.930 
can pull the hue and you'll see that all
of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.600> colors<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.649> image<00:00:52.680> are<00:00:53.190> going<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
of the colors in the image are going to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
of the colors in the image are going to
change<00:00:54.149> dramatically<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.530> let's<00:00:55.739> talk<00:00:55.949> about

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
change dramatically but let's talk about

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.209 
change dramatically but let's talk about
how<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:57.020> selectively<00:00:58.020> let's<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.100> go

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
how to do this selectively let's just go

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.130 
how to do this selectively let's just go
ahead<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.680> delete<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.629> let's<00:01:03.629> change<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
ahead and delete this let's change the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
ahead and delete this let's change the
color<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.769> my<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.189> boy's<00:01:05.369> shirt<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:05.970> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
to do that we're going to start with a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440 
to do that we're going to start with a
selection<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> shirt<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.270> going<00:01:09.390> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
selection of just the shirt I'm going to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.660 
selection of just the shirt I'm going to
use<00:01:09.540> my<00:01:09.720> quick<00:01:09.990> select<00:01:10.380> tool<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:11.430> I'm<00:01:11.549> going

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
use my quick select tool and I'm going

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.030 
use my quick select tool and I'm going
to<00:01:11.729> option<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.270> alt-click<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:13.409> deselect<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
to option or alt-click to deselect the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.090 
to option or alt-click to deselect the
area<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.310> don't<00:01:14.400> want<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.780> looks<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:16.259> I'm

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
area I don't want that looks good I'm

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.429 
area I don't want that looks good I'm
going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> come<00:01:17.400> back<00:01:17.580> into<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> same

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
going to come back into the same

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.149 
going to come back into the same
hue/saturation<00:01:19.439> adjustment<00:01:19.530> layer<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
hue/saturation adjustment layer and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.280 
hue/saturation adjustment layer and
you'll<00:01:20.430> see<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.909> we've<00:01:21.030> created<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.659> mask

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you'll see that we've created a mask

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.140 
you'll see that we've created a mask
when<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.830> went<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.119> that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
when we went in there and what that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.200 
when we went in there and what that
means<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:24.930> anything<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.820> only

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
means is that anything we do is only

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.440 
means is that anything we do is only
going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.600> affect<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.710> region<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.450> these

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
going to affect that region and these

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.780 
going to affect that region and these
sliders<00:01:30.810> work<00:01:31.140> fine<00:01:31.470> there's<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> much<00:01:32.579> better

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
sliders work fine there's a much better

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.969 
sliders work fine there's a much better
way<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.479> we're<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> use<00:01:34.770> this

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
way to do this we're going to use this

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.690 
way to do this we're going to use this
on<00:01:35.189> image<00:01:35.640> tool<00:01:35.909> right<00:01:36.329> here<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.890> all

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
on image tool right here and with it all

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.200 
on image tool right here and with it all
we<00:01:38.880> need<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.570> click<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.650> drag<00:01:40.909> left<00:01:41.909> or

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
we need to do is click and drag left or

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.200 
we need to do is click and drag left or
right<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.320> saturate<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.180> desaturate<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
right to saturate or desaturate the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.179 
right to saturate or desaturate the
image<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.840> where<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.799> gets<00:01:46.979> really

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
image and where this gets really

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.069 
image and where this gets really
interesting<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.509> hold<00:01:48.720> down<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
interesting is if I hold down the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.249 
interesting is if I hold down the
command<00:01:49.259> key<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.970> change<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.659> color<00:01:51.930> I'm

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
command key I can change the color I'm

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.359 
command key I can change the color I'm
changing<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> hue<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.600> fly<00:01:54.840> here<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:56.009> I

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
changing the hue on the fly here so I

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.060 
changing the hue on the fly here so I
get<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> color<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.119> want<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.860> even

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
get the color I want and then I can even

get the color I want and then I can even
adjust<00:01:59.369> the<00:02:00.170> lightness<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.430> he's

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
adjust the lightness of it so now he's

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.690

got a lighter blue shirt okay that was

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.850 
got a lighter blue shirt okay that was
pretty<00:02:05.880> easy<00:02:06.000> now<00:02:06.960> let's<00:02:07.200> look<00:02:07.409> at<00:02:07.500> how<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.680> do

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
pretty easy now let's look at how to do

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.750 
pretty easy now let's look at how to do
that<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.310> black-and-white<00:02:09.080> selectively

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
that with black-and-white selectively

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.890 
that with black-and-white selectively
alright<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.060> there's<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.300> black<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.569> white

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
alright so there's a black and white

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.710 
alright so there's a black and white
adjustment

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
adjustment

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.360 
adjustment
they<00:02:13.780> are<00:02:13.930> here<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.380> I'm<00:02:14.860> going<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.010> click<00:02:15.220> on

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
they are here and I'm going to click on

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.460 
they are here and I'm going to click on
that<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.540> whole<00:02:16.660> image<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.050> black<00:02:17.230> and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
white so in order to mask off that area

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.770 
white so in order to mask off that area
I'm<00:02:20.710> just<00:02:20.980> going<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.130> hold<00:02:21.280> down<00:02:21.490> my<00:02:21.550> option<00:02:22.060> or

the<00:02:45.700> density<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.390> mask<00:02:46.770> which<00:02:47.770> will<00:02:47.800> just

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
the density of the mask which will just

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.920 
the density of the mask which will just
chew<00:02:48.310> right<00:02:48.490> through<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.600> information

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.920 
chew right through it to the information
behind<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:51.310> can<00:02:51.490> feather<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.910> edges<00:02:52.450> of

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
behind it and I can feather the edges of

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.170 
behind it and I can feather the edges of
the<00:02:53.050> mask<00:02:53.200> as<00:02:53.440> well<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:54.340> soften<00:02:54.550> things<00:02:54.880> out<00:02:55.150> a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.140 
the mask as well to soften things out a
little<00:02:55.360> bit<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:56.490> there<00:02:57.490> you<00:02:57.610> see<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.970> using

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
little bit so there you see that using

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.410 
little bit so there you see that using
masks<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.380> on<00:02:59.560> image<00:02:59.860> control<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:01.209> can

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
masks and the on image control you can

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.250 
masks and the on image control you can
adjust<00:03:02.230> hue<00:03:02.620> saturation<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:04.030> even<00:03:04.660> selective
