00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.100 

I<00:02:39.620> like<00:02:40.620> how<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.950> comes<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.360> actual

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
I like how it comes with the actual

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.980 
I like how it comes with the actual
string<00:02:43.440> itself<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.460> if<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.700> were<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.240> plan<00:02:45.810> on

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
string itself so if you were to plan on

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.620 
string itself so if you were to plan on
using<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:46.770> cosplay<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.580> could<00:02:47.910> do<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.420> I

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
using it for cosplay you could do so I

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.140 
using it for cosplay you could do so I
believe<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:52.200> actual<00:02:52.770> toy<00:02:52.980> only<00:02:53.370> plays<00:02:53.700> more

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
believe this actual toy only plays more

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.770 
believe this actual toy only plays more
melody<00:02:54.600> as<00:02:54.750> well<00:02:55.080> but<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.040> also<00:02:56.270> opens<00:02:57.270> and

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
melody as well but it also opens and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.730 
melody as well but it also opens and
closes<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:59.540> this<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.600> very<00:03:00.810> accurate<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
closes and this is very accurate to the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:11.420 
closes and this is very accurate to the
design<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.970> anime<00:03:03.480> version<00:03:10.040> as<00:03:11.040> well<00:03:11.310> as

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
design of the anime version as well as

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.640 
design of the anime version as well as
the<00:03:11.610> inside<00:03:12.090> as<00:03:12.360> well<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:15.990> product<00:03:16.440> takes

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
the inside as well so this product takes

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.370 
the inside as well so this product takes
the<00:03:17.010> round<00:03:17.670> flat<00:03:18.120> batteries<00:03:18.690> as<00:03:18.960> well<00:03:18.990> that

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
the round flat batteries as well that

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.010 
the round flat batteries as well that
you<00:03:19.470> typically<00:03:19.920> see<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.550> toys<00:03:20.820> like<00:03:21.300> this<00:03:21.630> and

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
you typically see in toys like this and

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.700 
you typically see in toys like this and
it<00:03:22.590> has<00:03:22.770> an<00:03:23.130> on/off<00:03:23.760> switch<00:03:23.790> as<00:03:24.510> well<00:03:24.710> this

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
it has an on/off switch as well this

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.350 
it has an on/off switch as well this
already<00:03:25.890> has<00:03:26.220> batteries<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.880> there<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.270> I'll

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
already has batteries in there so I'll

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:40.230 
already has batteries in there so I'll
just<00:03:27.540> show<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.750> how<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.080> works

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.690 

so<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:41.050> press<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.680> center<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.520> the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
so you just press the center of the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:57.780 
so you just press the center of the
locket<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.870> it's<00:03:56.050> not<00:03:56.230> like<00:03:56.530> em<00:03:56.770> for<00:03:57.220> example

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
locket so it's not like em for example

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.530 
locket so it's not like em for example
with<00:03:57.940> Sailor<00:03:58.240> Moon<00:03:58.480> where<00:03:58.780> it<00:03:59.110> actually

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
with Sailor Moon where it actually

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.020 
with Sailor Moon where it actually
shouts<00:04:01.540> out<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.170> transformation<00:04:03.030> sequence

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
shouts out the transformation sequence

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.570 
shouts out the transformation sequence
at<00:04:04.330> all<00:04:04.540> which<00:04:04.960> is<00:04:05.170> quite<00:04:05.590> saddening<00:04:06.160> there

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
at all which is quite saddening there

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.340 
at all which is quite saddening there
there<00:04:07.390> you<00:04:07.540> go<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:13.480> that's<00:04:13.690> literally<00:04:14.200> it

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
there you go and that's literally it

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.580 
there you go and that's literally it
that's<00:04:14.920> all<00:04:15.160> it<00:04:15.370> does
