00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
track and the main reason I made this

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.300 
track and the main reason I made this
track<00:00:36.370> was<00:00:36.880> to<00:00:37.270> see<00:00:37.510> how<00:00:38.080> you<00:00:38.140> guys<00:00:38.560> liked<00:00:39.010> it

track was to see how you guys liked it

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.010 
track was to see how you guys liked it
and<00:00:39.810> if<00:00:40.810> it<00:00:41.320> matches<00:00:42.040> up<00:00:42.280> to<00:00:42.700> the<00:00:42.910> Mario<00:00:43.510> Kart<00:00:43.600> 8

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
and if it matches up to the Mario Kart 8

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.910 
and if it matches up to the Mario Kart 8
DLC<00:00:44.610> pack<00:00:45.610> 2<00:00:45.940> which<00:00:46.330> will<00:00:46.630> have<00:00:46.870> anymore

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
DLC pack 2 which will have anymore

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.150

drop<00:00:48.670> I<00:00:49.030> mean<00:00:49.390> an<00:00:49.630> animal<00:00:50.080> crossing<00:00:50.710> of<00:00:50.830> course

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
drop I mean an animal crossing of course

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.530 
drop I mean an animal crossing of course
I<00:00:52.950> honestly<00:00:53.950> think<00:00:54.310> this<00:00:54.610> one<00:00:54.880> will<00:00:55.060> be<00:00:55.330> better

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
I honestly think this one will be better

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.080 
I honestly think this one will be better
but<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:57.040> Wii<00:00:57.250> U<00:00:57.430> does<00:00:57.790> have<00:00:58.150> HD<00:00:58.930> graphics<00:01:00.090> also

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
but the Wii U does have HD graphics also

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.420 
but the Wii U does have HD graphics also
in<00:01:01.660> this<00:01:01.840> course<00:01:02.170> if<00:01:02.500> you<00:01:02.650> hit<00:01:02.920> one<00:01:02.950> of<00:01:03.130> these

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
in this course if you hit one of these

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:11.639 
in this course if you hit one of these
creatures<00:01:04.089> you<00:01:07.229> get<00:01:08.229> damaged<00:01:08.829> by<00:01:09.130> it<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.780> try

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
creatures you get damaged by it so try

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.569 
creatures you get damaged by it so try
to<00:01:11.679> avoid<00:01:11.920> them<00:01:13.409> especially<00:01:14.409> this<00:01:15.009> one<00:01:15.280> this

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
to avoid them especially this one this

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.649 
to avoid them especially this one this
has<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.359> effect<00:01:16.719> of<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:17.109> Cadillac<00:01:18.659> that'll

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
has the effect of a Cadillac that'll

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.560 
has the effect of a Cadillac that'll
cost<00:01:19.960> you<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.259> lot<00:01:20.469> of<00:01:20.649> time<00:01:21.149> there's<00:01:22.149> also<00:01:22.329> a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
cost you a lot of time there's also a

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.149 
cost you a lot of time there's also a
few<00:01:23.070> shortcuts<00:01:24.070> on<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.520> strap<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.799> I<00:01:26.920> just

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
few shortcuts on the strap but I just

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.060 
few shortcuts on the strap but I just
really<00:01:27.549> liked<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:27.999> idea<00:01:28.030> of

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
really liked the idea of

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.960 
really liked the idea of
crossing<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:31.340> mean<00:01:32.340> even<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.790> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
crossing in it and I mean even if it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.960 
crossing in it and I mean even if it
wasn't<00:01:33.450> supposed<00:01:34.050> to<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.740> an<00:01:34.890> animal<00:01:35.340> crossing

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
wasn't supposed to be an animal crossing

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.490 
wasn't supposed to be an animal crossing
of<00:01:36.120> course<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:37.350> would<00:01:37.590> still<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.490> fun

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
of course it would still be really fun

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.320 
of course it would still be really fun
now<00:01:40.500> here<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.190> something<00:01:41.760> they<00:01:41.910> can<00:01:42.119> put

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
now here this is something they can put

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.800 
now here this is something they can put
it<00:01:42.450> Mario<00:01:42.840> Kart<00:01:43.200> 8<00:01:43.410> I<00:01:43.880> guess<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.119> saw<00:01:45.510> there

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
it Mario Kart 8 I guess you saw there

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.650 
it Mario Kart 8 I guess you saw there
it's<00:01:46.080> like<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> slab<00:01:47.040> did<00:01:47.340> turn<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.450> can

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
it's like a slab did turn so they can

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:57.580 
it's like a slab did turn so they can
use<00:01:49.400> Mario<00:01:50.400> Kart<00:01:50.759> 8<00:01:51.140> anti-gravity<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.440> that

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.460 

so<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:59.369> one<00:01:59.729> lap<00:01:59.970> but<00:02:00.509> after<00:02:00.900> 1<00:02:01.140> minute

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
so that's one lap but after 1 minute

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.570 
so that's one lap but after 1 minute
passes<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.550> sky<00:02:02.880> becomes<00:02:03.860> orange<00:02:04.860> which<00:02:05.399> is

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
passes the sky becomes orange which is

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.320 
passes the sky becomes orange which is
supposed<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.770> sunset<00:02:07.770> which<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.940> really

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
supposed to be sunset which is really

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.850 
supposed to be sunset which is really
neat<00:02:09.570> and<00:02:11.420> here's<00:02:12.420> just<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.900> shortcut<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.680> need

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
neat and here's just a shortcut you need

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.530 
neat and here's just a shortcut you need
one<00:02:14.130> mushroom<00:02:14.610> for<00:02:16.580> I'm<00:02:17.580> going<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.090> take<00:02:18.330> this

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
one mushroom for I'm going to take this

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.940 
one mushroom for I'm going to take this
route<00:02:18.870> again<00:02:19.550> but<00:02:20.660> I'll<00:02:21.660> probably<00:02:21.959> take<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
route again but I'll probably take the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.670 
route again but I'll probably take the
other<00:02:23.190> route<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.820> lap<00:02:24.060> three<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.959> can<00:02:25.410> show

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
other route the lap three so I can show

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.030 
other route the lap three so I can show
it<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.780> biggest<00:02:30.780> shortcut<00:02:31.739> I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
it to you this is the biggest shortcut I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.420 
it to you this is the biggest shortcut I
think<00:02:32.519> this<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.880> also<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.420> faster<00:02:33.959> out<00:02:34.310> if<00:02:35.310> you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
think this is also the faster out if you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.490 
think this is also the faster out if you
have<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.580> one<00:02:36.030> mushroom<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.690> can<00:02:37.049> just<00:02:37.260> cut

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
have a one mushroom you can just cut

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.850 
have a one mushroom you can just cut
through<00:02:37.709> there<00:02:38.070> but<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:39.110> guess<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.320> custom

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
through there but I guess the custom

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.030 
through there but I guess the custom
track<00:02:41.160> creator<00:02:41.790> never<00:02:42.780> thought<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.410> using

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
track creator never thought of using

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.180 
track creator never thought of using
bullet<00:02:44.700> bills<00:02:44.940> for<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.450> shortcut<00:02:46.260> which

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
bullet bills for that shortcut which

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.790 
bullet bills for that shortcut which
sucks

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.030 

this<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:51.980> also<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.430> really<00:02:52.910> sharp<00:02:53.210> turn<00:02:54.040> you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
this is also a really sharp turn you

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.450 
this is also a really sharp turn you
kind<00:02:55.310> of<00:02:55.400> need<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.810> play<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.020> course<00:02:57.460> before

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
kind of need to play the course before

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.360 
kind of need to play the course before
you<00:02:58.910> know<00:02:59.060> what<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.540> do<00:02:59.690> there<00:03:00.020> or<00:03:00.740> just<00:03:01.070> start

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
you know what to do there or just start

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.210 
you know what to do there or just start
turning<00:03:01.640> really<00:03:02.090> early

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
turning really early

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.070 
turning really early
okay<00:03:04.220> now<00:03:04.400> I'm<00:03:04.580> lap<00:03:04.850> three<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.860> sky<00:03:07.250> becomes

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
okay now I'm lap three the sky becomes
