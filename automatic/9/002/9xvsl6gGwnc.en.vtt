does<00:01:34.500> either<00:01:35.630> ok<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> next<00:01:36.840> app<00:01:37.259> will<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:38.009> it

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
does either ok the next app will be it

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.149 
does either ok the next app will be it
is<00:01:39.689> called<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.500> colored<00:01:41.070> knob<00:01:41.360> right<00:01:42.360> here<00:01:42.420> and

so<00:02:14.000> next<00:02:14.239> step<00:02:14.390> i<00:02:14.720> will<00:02:14.750> be<00:02:15.019> reviewing<00:02:15.200> is

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
so next step i will be reviewing is

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.740 
so next step i will be reviewing is
called<00:02:16.190> icon<00:02:16.790> passcode<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:22.220> pops<00:02:22.459> up

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
called icon passcode and this pops up

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.920 
called icon passcode and this pops up
pay<00:02:23.750> your<00:02:23.870> price<00:02:24.019> going<00:02:24.349> on<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:25.810> what<00:02:26.810> this
