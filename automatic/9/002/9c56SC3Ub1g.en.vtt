fake dr. Lebon lately I've been playing
around<00:00:23.830> with<00:00:24.310> this<00:00:24.520> idea<00:00:24.700> of<00:00:25.680> creating

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
around with this idea of creating

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.070 
around with this idea of creating
pulsing<00:00:27.220> textures<00:00:27.700> on<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.060> guitar<00:00:28.450> and<00:00:28.720> I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
pulsing textures on the guitar and I

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.080 
pulsing textures on the guitar and I
wanted<00:00:29.350> to<00:00:29.470> show<00:00:29.710> you<00:00:29.740> over<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.670> course<00:00:30.910> of<00:00:31.000> a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
wanted to show you over the course of a

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.570 
wanted to show you over the course of a
couple<00:00:31.210> of<00:00:31.420> weeks<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.779> few<00:00:32.380> examples<00:00:33.040> of<00:00:33.309> this

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
couple of weeks a few examples of this

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.299 
couple of weeks a few examples of this
technique<00:00:34.059> I'm<00:00:34.210> working<00:00:34.570> on<00:00:34.690> so<00:00:35.680> the

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
technique I'm working on so the

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.250 
technique I'm working on so the
technique<00:00:36.820> to<00:00:37.059> create<00:00:37.600> these<00:00:37.750> pulsing

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
technique to create these pulsing

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.500 
technique to create these pulsing
textures<00:00:38.770> requires<00:00:39.640> that<00:00:39.850> you<00:00:39.970> use<00:00:40.000> two

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
textures requires that you use two

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.200 
textures requires that you use two
fingers<00:00:40.540> in<00:00:41.320> your<00:00:41.470> right<00:00:41.620> hand<00:00:41.920> to<00:00:42.250> pluck<00:00:42.550> two

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
fingers in your right hand to pluck two

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.740 
fingers in your right hand to pluck two
strings<00:00:43.690> at<00:00:44.020> a<00:00:44.080> time<00:00:44.530> on<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.520> guitar<00:00:45.850> I<00:00:46.150> use

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
strings at a time on the guitar I use

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.450 
strings at a time on the guitar I use
adjacent<00:00:47.320> strings<00:00:47.620> mostly<00:00:48.129> for<00:00:48.309> this

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
adjacent strings mostly for this

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.510 
adjacent strings mostly for this
technique<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:50.739> ends<00:00:51.100> up<00:00:51.130> signing<00:00:51.489> with

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
technique and it ends up signing with

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:08.700 
technique and it ends up signing with
this

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.550 

and<00:01:09.160> it<00:01:09.790> creates<00:01:10.180> these<00:01:10.390> cool<00:01:10.840> pulsing

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
and it creates these cool pulsing

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.400 
and it creates these cool pulsing
rhythms<00:01:12.010> that<00:01:12.370> are<00:01:12.760> great<00:01:13.480> for<00:01:13.510> accompanying

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
rhythms that are great for accompanying

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.920 
rhythms that are great for accompanying
other<00:01:15.130> instruments<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.270> they<00:01:16.360> create<00:01:16.690> a<00:01:16.720> good

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
other instruments and they create a good

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.660 
other instruments and they create a good
backbone<00:01:17.590> for<00:01:17.890> music<00:01:18.220> because<00:01:18.310> there's<00:01:18.580> a

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
backbone for music because there's a

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.870 
backbone for music because there's a
rhythmic<00:01:19.270> pulse<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.560> good<00:01:20.770> harmonic<00:01:21.490> pulse

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
rhythmic pulse and a good harmonic pulse

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.360 
rhythmic pulse and a good harmonic pulse
and<00:01:22.150> I've<00:01:22.630> just<00:01:22.780> found<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.260> be<00:01:23.440> a<00:01:23.860> really

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
and I've just found it to be a really

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.570 
and I've just found it to be a really
exciting<00:01:25.170> vibe<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.470> work<00:01:26.680> with<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.460> this

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
is an F major nine chord which will be

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.960 
is an F major nine chord which will be
tab<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.960> notated<00:01:35.530> in<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:36.100> description<00:01:36.729> below

and it uses the top four strings D G B
and<00:01:42.009> E<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.750> what<00:01:43.750> I<00:01:43.780> do<00:01:43.899> is<00:01:44.259> I<00:01:44.500> finger<00:01:45.250> the

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
and E and what I do is I finger the

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.120 
and E and what I do is I finger the
chord<00:01:45.700> like<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:50.229> my<00:01:50.410> right<00:01:50.619> hand<00:01:50.920> I

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
chord like so and with my right hand I

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.900 
chord like so and with my right hand I
pluck<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.850> D<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.300> g<00:01:52.390> strings<00:01:52.930> together<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.670> I

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
pluck the D and g strings together and I

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.940 
pluck the D and g strings together and I
plug<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.450> G<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:56.020> B<00:01:56.080> strings<00:01:56.470> together<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
plug the G and B strings together and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.990 
plug the G and B strings together and
these<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.790> B<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.479> E<00:02:01.930> strings<00:02:01.960> together<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:03.369> I

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
these the B and E strings together and I

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.590 
these the B and E strings together and I
mix<00:02:04.390> up<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.899> order<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:05.800> which<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.970> do<00:02:07.030> this<00:02:07.330> so

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
mix up the order in which I do this so

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.250 
mix up the order in which I do this so
sometimes<00:02:08.050> I'll<00:02:08.229> go<00:02:08.350> D<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.100> G<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:10.149> G<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.539> B<00:02:10.720> or

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
sometimes I'll go D and G the G and B or

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.520 
sometimes I'll go D and G the G and B or
sometimes<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.650> go<00:02:11.770> DG<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.640> beany<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.630> mix<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.440> up

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
sometimes I go DG to beany I mix it up

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.970 
sometimes I go DG to beany I mix it up
like<00:02:14.709> this

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.860 

and<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.100> you're<00:02:23.250> using<00:02:23.430> these<00:02:23.730> two<00:02:24.120> strings<00:02:24.630> at

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
and so you're using these two strings at

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.960 
and so you're using these two strings at
a<00:02:24.900> time<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.530> jumping<00:02:26.280> from<00:02:26.460> groups<00:02:26.760> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
a time and jumping from groups of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.200 
a time and jumping from groups of
strings<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.960> creates<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.470> really<00:02:29.210> like

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
strings and it creates this really like

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.930 
strings and it creates this really like
great<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:31.350> kind<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.100> sounds<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.430> maybe<00:02:32.670> two

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
great just kind of sounds like maybe two

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.820 
great just kind of sounds like maybe two
guitars<00:02:33.390> harmonized<00:02:34.050> with<00:02:34.290> each<00:02:34.440> other<00:02:34.650> it's

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
guitars harmonized with each other it's

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.630 
guitars harmonized with each other it's
very<00:02:34.890> full<00:02:35.400> wide<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.090> beautiful<00:02:36.620> glowy

very full wide and beautiful glowy

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.750 
very full wide and beautiful glowy

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.820 

and<00:03:21.390> it's<00:03:22.390> just<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.660> really<00:03:22.810> great<00:03:23.200> rhythm

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
and it's just a really great rhythm

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.130 
and it's just a really great rhythm
thing<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.610> do<00:03:24.790> I'm<00:03:25.360> gonna<00:03:25.540> say<00:03:25.630> it's<00:03:25.960> really

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
thing to do I'm gonna say it's really

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.170 
thing to do I'm gonna say it's really
great<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> million<00:03:27.010> more<00:03:27.220> times<00:03:27.640> over<00:03:28.000> the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
great a million more times over the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.960 
great a million more times over the
course<00:03:28.210> of<00:03:28.540> this<00:03:28.600> series<00:03:28.900> probably<00:03:29.560> and

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
course of this series probably and

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.820 
course of this series probably and
that's<00:03:30.970> because<00:03:31.390> it's<00:03:31.570> just<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:31.990> it's<00:03:32.560> really

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
that's because it's just so it's really

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.310 
that's because it's just so it's really
great<00:03:33.100> I<00:03:33.550> love<00:03:34.240> this<00:03:34.390> technique<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.960> hope<00:03:35.140> you

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
great I love this technique I hope you

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.520 
great I love this technique I hope you
love<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.710> too<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.490> hope<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:36.990> it<00:03:37.990> goes<00:03:38.200> well

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
love it too and I hope that it goes well

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.950 
love it too and I hope that it goes well
when<00:03:38.710> you<00:03:38.830> practice<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.460> some<00:03:39.850> tips<00:03:40.210> first<00:03:40.690> of

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
when you practice it some tips first of

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.810 
when you practice it some tips first of
all<00:03:41.140> it's<00:03:41.710> going<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.070> be<00:03:42.220> really<00:03:42.460> hard<00:03:42.700> at

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
all it's going to be really hard at

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.880 
all it's going to be really hard at
first<00:03:43.030> probably<00:03:43.300> for<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.840> lot<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.440> people<00:03:44.740> it

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
first probably for a lot of people it

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.610 
first probably for a lot of people it
was<00:03:45.070> for<00:03:45.370> me<00:03:45.550> it's<00:03:45.760> kind<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.060> awkward<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:47.410> use

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
was for me it's kind of awkward to use

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.560 
was for me it's kind of awkward to use
just<00:03:48.100> two<00:03:48.310> fingers<00:03:48.520> on<00:03:48.880> two<00:03:49.030> strings<00:03:49.240> at<00:03:49.510> a

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
just two fingers on two strings at a

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.840 
just two fingers on two strings at a
time<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:49.990> jump<00:03:50.230> like<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.650> because<00:03:51.070> you<00:03:51.700> know

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
time and jump like that because you know

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.550 
time and jump like that because you know
you<00:03:52.180> need<00:03:52.330> to<00:03:52.360> like<00:03:52.600> get<00:03:52.780> used<00:03:53.020> to<00:03:53.200> where<00:03:53.380> the

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
you need to like get used to where the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.800 
you need to like get used to where the
distance<00:03:54.460> is<00:03:54.580> between<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:55.060> strings<00:03:55.330> are<00:03:55.570> and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
distance is between the strings are and

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.540 
distance is between the strings are and
get<00:03:55.990> build<00:03:56.320> strength<00:03:56.620> in<00:03:56.860> your<00:03:56.950> fingers<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.520> I

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
get build strength in your fingers so I

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.970 
get build strength in your fingers so I
recommend<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.090> start<00:03:58.560> using<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.650> metronome

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
recommend to start using the metronome

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.310 
recommend to start using the metronome
very<00:04:00.700> slowly<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.480> just<00:04:01.870> getting<00:04:02.110> comfortable

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
very slowly and just getting comfortable

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.420 
very slowly and just getting comfortable
with<00:04:02.860> playing<00:04:03.100> two<00:04:03.640> strings<00:04:03.970> at<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.180> time<00:04:05.430> and

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
with playing two strings at a time and

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.900 
with playing two strings at a time and
work<00:04:06.730> on<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.420> very<00:04:07.630> slowly<00:04:07.900> patiently<00:04:08.910> solidly

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
work on it very slowly patiently solidly

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.580 
work on it very slowly patiently solidly
with<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.210> metronome<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:10.870> build<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.320> up<00:04:11.440> to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
with a metronome and build it up to

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.980 
with a metronome and build it up to
speed<00:04:11.770> over<00:04:11.950> time<00:04:12.360> be<00:04:13.360> patient<00:04:13.600> with<00:04:13.960> it

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
speed over time be patient with it

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.360 
speed over time be patient with it
because<00:04:14.440> it's<00:04:14.590> kind<00:04:14.830> of<00:04:14.860> awkward<00:04:15.040> at<00:04:15.340> first

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
because it's kind of awkward at first

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.580 
because it's kind of awkward at first
but<00:04:15.880> ends<00:04:16.480> up<00:04:16.540> being<00:04:16.810> really<00:04:16.989> pretty<00:04:17.350> and

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
but ends up being really pretty and

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.650 
but ends up being really pretty and
everything<00:04:18.130> with<00:04:18.280> guitar<00:04:19.060> pretty<00:04:19.480> much

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
everything with guitar pretty much

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.599 
everything with guitar pretty much
that's<00:04:19.930> worth<00:04:20.530> learning<00:04:21.040> takes<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.430> bit<00:04:21.580> of

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
that's worth learning takes a bit of

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.450 
that's worth learning takes a bit of
practice<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.740> can't<00:04:24.010> think<00:04:24.160> of<00:04:24.280> any

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
practice and I can't think of any

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.110 
practice and I can't think of any
exceptions<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.180> right<00:04:25.510> now<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.490> just<00:04:27.490> you

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
exceptions to that right now so just you

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.460 
exceptions to that right now so just you
know<00:04:28.210> be<00:04:29.020> be<00:04:29.940> patient<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.090> have<00:04:31.270> fun<00:04:31.540> I<00:04:31.720> hope

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
know be be patient and have fun I hope

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.160 
know be be patient and have fun I hope
you<00:04:32.620> have<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.800> great<00:04:32.950> week
