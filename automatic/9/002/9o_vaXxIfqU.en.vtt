and there's believes it twigs in it it's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.780 
and there's believes it twigs in it it's
probably<00:00:38.309> weeks<00:00:38.879> old<00:00:40.100> we're<00:00:41.100> ranked<00:00:41.309> 15

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
probably weeks old we're ranked 15

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.549 
probably weeks old we're ranked 15
