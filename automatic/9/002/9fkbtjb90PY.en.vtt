 Tells us if it is that we want us 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.810
 restart recovery at this time if 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.239
 is that we want to check that really 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.250

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.200
 if we are going to give it in ok and if it is 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.269
