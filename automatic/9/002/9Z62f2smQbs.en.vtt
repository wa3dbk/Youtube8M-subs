 Man wants to get 

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:12.619
 that she knows from black on white 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.019
 in the new film by Günter Wallraff 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.539
 The Cologne journalist has come up with the help of his friend Smog was in 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.630
 make a black one 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.259
 again and again for a year 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.999
 Although never from Somalia, he moves with hidden camera through Germany 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.720
 experience how everyday racism

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.840
 w 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.150
 Not every example of racism in Thale is so threatening 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.190
 dumb sayings are on the way 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.870
 Evasions Wallraff says he has almost always learned in his role 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.870
 stuck on these streets 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.600
 Nevertheless, there are also the positive examples in the absence, for example, at 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.160
 This employer on job search this time with his friend Mukhtar brands could 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
 It was a nice experience Munich 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.590
 Black on white the movie mirror online as a future clock exactly what 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.300
 is necessary 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.770
 the black Peter Bar every day in Germany to experience the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.980
 Premiere audience skeptical 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.920
 he should let it go 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.020
 once he is second for the first time a project is in white one normal but 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.170
 I have many friends who have studied in Germany one 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.219
 Market has that was the second state examination 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.399
 in Zurich I believe that do not make such experiences although the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.719
 Then darker skin color 1 is created and you are allowed to open up 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:49.640
 every case 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 he is responsible for discussions 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.780
 and on the verge of the premiere in Cologne, I greet Günter Wallraff customer 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.180
 Eve 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.800
 what was in that role of a black Germany for her personally the 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.550
 threatened to learn 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.030
 now that you finally perceived only about his skin color 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:10.989
 and has been defined 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.220
 I do not behave well behave differently than usual otherwise 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.949
 courteously friendly 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.289
 and suddenly 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.669
 when the other people met them 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.559
 and I became everywhere 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:26.370
 turned off mocked laughter and even with those to 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:27.019
 part 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.099
 which means well with one Ben 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.189
 ple Warneke No, like a child against the same duel over par, it has 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.189
 are surprised this experience is made 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.410
 It surprised me so far that the FIA ​​was no other 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.400
 except this with 2 millimeters simply percent black skin 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.369
 Ten of black wig and Jack's eyes 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.709
 otherwise I was yourself. "That was the role where I at least created myself 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.419
 have 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.139
 I am provoked but also voiced the accusation even by Estonians 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.779
 reverse processes in black to white oppressed minorities 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:04.329
 Attention and Festivities Spector's first plans to reap for himself 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.399
 What do you think 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:09.729
 that, too, can be made public in any complaint of the attempt 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.469
 and percent there is a representative 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.149
 the blue spruce held up the percent 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.779
 which also published a bear% noteworthy book 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.469
 Percent black and white I think 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.249
 Her attention now more and says attention and the book of one 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.159
 authentic fun is more perceived 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.439
 the so-called and additional sense 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.180
 but you can not refuse me to take on reality 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.809
 my methods which has always been used now 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:43.199
 to get over this society voila yes and 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:47.569
 Unstable conditions also loosen up and break up and maybe 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.049
 turning off to Alzey have been doing these jobs for decades and cover up 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.129
 again and again, grievances can shake up anything 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:00.129
 me as usual not at it I do not get used to 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.040
 Donating I always do that as possible for everything 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.989
 I had a childlike and you alive IT to me too 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.099
 and Vettel 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.599
 everyone would pretend that more is possible then ultimately there is more 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.979
 possible as of late 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.079
 consider possible where I am also purpose optimized and I also have the 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.599
 positive sides yes also highlighted when I am abroad and should be on the 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.120
 There are other sites on the negative side of Germany 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.159
 are a total meanwhile look at antimilitarism country 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:33.580
 we have environmental standards for me and how cool we need something like that 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.459
 National pride actually is not but remnants of this society and 

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:38.629
 they have to overcome 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.909
 and then we come to a new one 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:44.229
 according to international society grow very quickly very abundant 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.009
 confidence 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.870
 and I am confident that we will continue to be many of their listeners 

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:53.340
 thanks to Günter Wallraff in Cologne 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.409
