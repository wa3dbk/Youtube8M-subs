00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
on to the review first storyline I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.650 
on to the review first storyline I
thought<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.099> episode<00:02:08.399> was<00:02:08.580> fantastic<00:02:09.209> that

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
thought this episode was fantastic that

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.390 
thought this episode was fantastic that
said<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.289> think<00:02:10.530> if<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:10.830> new<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> Sailor

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
said I think if you're new to the Sailor

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.680 
said I think if you're new to the Sailor
Moon<00:02:11.580> universe<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.239> you're<00:02:12.360> just

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
Moon universe and you're just

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.060 
Moon universe and you're just
jumping<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.200> especially<00:02:13.620> if<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.770> just<00:02:13.920> see

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
jumping in especially if you just see

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.950 
jumping in especially if you just see
this<00:02:14.250> episode<00:02:14.400> randomly<00:02:15.090> you'd<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> little

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
this episode randomly you'd be a little

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.390 
this episode randomly you'd be a little
confused<00:02:16.470> because<00:02:16.650> there's<00:02:17.070> really<00:02:17.220> no

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
confused because there's really no

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.340 
confused because there's really no
explanation<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.690> think<00:02:18.930> that's<00:02:19.110> just<00:02:19.260> kind

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
explanation but I think that's just kind

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.600 
explanation but I think that's just kind
of<00:02:19.590> how<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.740> episodes<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.130> gonna<00:02:20.250> work<00:02:20.460> now

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
of how the episodes are gonna work now

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.310 
of how the episodes are gonna work now
because<00:02:20.880> there's<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.390> much<00:02:21.540> plot<00:02:21.840> being<00:02:22.080> put

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
because there's so much plot being put

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.660 
because there's so much plot being put
in<00:02:22.410> every<00:02:22.590> episode<00:02:22.680> they<00:02:23.070> didn't<00:02:23.430> have<00:02:23.520> to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
in every episode they didn't have to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.090 
in every episode they didn't have to
kind<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.330> keep<00:02:24.630> marching<00:02:24.900> forward<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:25.950> you
