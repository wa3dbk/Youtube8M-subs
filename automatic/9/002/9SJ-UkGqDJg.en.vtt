00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
there let's do a quick size comparison

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.279 
there let's do a quick size comparison
to<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> goo<00:00:47.370> ha<00:00:50.449> this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> size<00:00:51.899> compared<00:00:52.260> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
to a goo ha this is the size compared to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.110 
to a goo ha this is the size compared to
go<00:00:52.500> home<00:00:55.760> class<00:00:56.760> compared<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> 2<00:00:58.050> by<00:00:58.260> 2<00:00:59.120> you'd

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
go home class compared to a 2 by 2 you'd

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:09.410 
go home class compared to a 2 by 2 you'd
be<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.390> keyless<00:01:03.799> see<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.630> yes<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:08.360> it<00:01:09.360> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
be like keyless see that yes so it is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.390 
be like keyless see that yes so it is
smaller<00:01:09.960> than<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.549> regular<00:01:11.549> three<00:01:11.939> by<00:01:12.090> three

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400
