 Hi, I'm going to introduce you to my engine home 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.210
 it's a toyota hiace 2.2 engine 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.990
 we are going to start it 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.420
 we look forward to a milestone that turns off the light of 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.420
 heating 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.060
 there is here 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.490
 and the engine is already running 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.860
 very well all the mechanics is fine 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.820
 has a consumption more or less than 7 liters 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.820
 every 100 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:58.540
 in the part of the cabin 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:02.040
 and that's the part of the motorhome forward 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.949
 I can sleep a person a boy 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.340
 let's move on to enter next 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.340
 the motor 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.189
 here is the directv antenna that is the 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.189
 Weapon and disarm for a while 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.020
 up here has the awning that is without 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.800
 support or be armed with all the bars 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.800
 without touching the ground 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.350
 here we go up 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.350
 we have the hillside 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:44.350
 what is 220 and 12 volt here we have the 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.350
 anafe everything works 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.020
 It's in use 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.020
 everything works 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.400
 behind the kitchen we have the bathroom in 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.400
 sliding door 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.350
 and in his laboratory 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.310
 the water and in the practical has 20 liters 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.020
 has cold or hot water shower gas 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.160
 we will attend to see it 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.160
 why 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.610
 here is 220 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.130
 here is 12 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.110
 behind this has a piece of furniture where 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.160
 can save some things is going to 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.160
 cost the water bomb 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:53.150
 back has the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:03:00.260
 the room the table that arms bed 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:03.739
 and up there is everyone here in the background 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.300
 another on this side now also 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.370
 we have 220 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.620
 yes 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.940
 and we have 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.480
 two onions 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.090
 all the motorhome has 2 2012 and 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.750
 ahead in front of the bathroom is the 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.600
 kitchen or is the lavatory that 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.180
 as well 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.939
 we have the tap 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.760
 it works perfectly and we have a 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.480
 water purifier thing not to be 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.810
 buying 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.599
 mineral water swims the fields 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.370
 we have an average expenditure on top of this 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.599
 as well 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.599
 we have dinners 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.159
 here we have to prune the cutlery and 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.159
 other things that we also have 220 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.210
 everything works perfect and above we have 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.860
 the television 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.860
 is with directv 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.440
 we have a small ball down here 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.959
 and on the other side too 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.669
 then here below the lavatory we have 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.669
 a built-in battery charger 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.000
 if we are in the campsite what 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:36.290
 we load and automatically 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.220
 is loading us and we have autonomy to 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.220
 the entire mobile home 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.780
 and if not when the two batteries one is 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.630
 You can cancel that you have to cancel 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.050
 Down here 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.530
 then it is spent alone on the battery of the 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.860
 motorhome and here for example we cut it 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.330
 the current and there the battery works 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.520
 of the engine home I if we do not put it 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.630
 again in series and it serves to 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.590
 start or for functions 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.590
 it kills me fire 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.039
 up going upstairs you have one 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:30.340
 air-conditioned mails with pre-system 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.940
 cooled that works perfectly and what 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.940
 let's learn 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.090
 there it started 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.950
 This is the coolest of all with lights 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.950
 built-in complete 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.690
 Oh 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:02.190
 listen to the engine sound the engine does not 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:04.750
 consumes no oil does not smoke the engine 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.370
 it's fine and consumption is 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.560
 here 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.560
 there is the side part 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.570
 the back of the motorhome 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.820
 to work multiply I escaped 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.469
 you can see there, it's working 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:30.360
 good and here we have a ladder 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.360
 that we went up 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.770
 and we have a bulge holder for 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.400
 transport a lot of things 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.400
 good 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.010
 small step
