00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.580
 It is Friday the twentieth of March 2015 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.850
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.440
 engelsburg news and start today 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.800
 we with the dates of the day 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.930
 sunrise why 634 sunset 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.570
 will be around 18 42 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.400
 The day started at dusk around 61 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.680
 and ends with the onset of darkness 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.810
 and 19h 16 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.360
 and today we are the same 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.220
 last day in the star sign of the fish 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.160
 we have today the 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:52.109
 Equinox and that 's exactly about 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.090
 23 45 further to the moon is in the 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.890
 star sign of the aries and thus 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.930
 between the earth and the sun 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.120
 that means we have new moon and the moon 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.309
 shows us his shadow side is so 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.330
 not illuminated moonrise 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:10.080
 why 628 and sunset will be at 19 o'clock 6 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.230
 1 and with a distance of 358,000 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.210
 38 kilometers to the earth is the moon 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.210
 again a piece away from us 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.240
 The activity of the sun is now clear 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.789
 subsided even when the strongest 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.270
 eruption 17.9 was flair 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.649
 this came from active region 22 97 the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.020
 already behind the western one 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.439
 sunburn councils the other active 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.630
 region was 23 02 also on the western 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.920
 sunburn from the eastern sunburn 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.920
 so far hardly anything 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.970
 today's magneto bar hardly shows 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.490
 still potential of the three left 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.740
 remaining regions are an alpha and 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.840
 2 beta configured there are the 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.119
 coming days in things solar eruption 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.159
 rather calm the flair probability 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.440
 is still with 20% in the m-class 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.360
 indicated yet in ours 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.530
 Area of ​​the sun has no region 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.530
 this potential 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.790
 after coronal mass ejection 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.010
 going through would be loud spiraling 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.200
 just a southern communal current 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.060
 who continue to welcome us in batches 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.739
 and fast solar wind sends this 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:33.689
 elevated values ​​are expected in the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:35.459
 The next days will also be the southern one 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.109
 Municipal flow keeps the suns 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.930
 wind speed and the plasma 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.939
 temperature is still high what we at the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.180
 Detect curves of the magneto meter well 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.680
 can be 550 to 600 kilometers per 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.609
 seconds are enough 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.739
 our earth's magnetic field also reacts this way 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.650
 continues to hold in the us 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.629
 geomagnetic storm at level g1 too 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.419
 if the kp index is up in the meantime 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.639
 p3 sank with us in europe where that 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.280
 magnetic field is still slightly stronger than in 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.290
 overseas it is so similar to just that 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.689
 the geo-research center potsdam this 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.310
 level does not yet color red 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.720
 Prediction of the noa should be this 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.769
 the levels also fluctuate in the 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.769
 to keep coming days 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.489
 Today there are two small asteroids 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.609
 only a few days ago were discovered 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.609
 and us at a close distance of 4.2 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.229
 and 27 years of distancing happen 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.750
 but that's still enough 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:36.060
 to stay completely relaxed 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.010
 at the meteors nasa could do two 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.849
 fireballs on after leaving the usa 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.849
 to register 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.629
 geological seismic activity 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.760
 it is relatively quiet in the west pacific 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.220
 Five quakes between Japan and New Zealand 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.980
 were three in the four-magnitude and 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.409
 although the company reached 5.1 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.610
 Papua New Guinea and 5.0 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.099
 New Caledonia 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.379
 in the usa , the increased level is maintained 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.970
 and there was a quake chain of 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.280
 the west to the east coast 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.620
 next to some quakes in the northwest at 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.659
 Seattle and the volcanoes of the Cascade 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.870
 Mountains came in California and 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:18.690
 nevada to 110 earthquakes in the usual 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.729
 focus also in South America 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.620
 the seismic activity after again 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.949
 but the strongest quakes still reached 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.570
 getting the magnitude 5.0 in Europe and 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.880
 the adjacent areas left the 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.580
 Activity also a bit behind 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.160
 on 42 shake of which the strongest the 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.710
 magnitude 3.5 had and is in the 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.840
 adria occurred most of the others 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.600
 Quakes occurred in a circle 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.860
 the southern igs and western turquoises 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.080
 in connection with the 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.250
 eclipse could stand 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.250
 I do not recognize any yet 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.490
 weather has europe that the 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.500
 Western deep clearly in strength 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.479
 won and influenced even that 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.849
 weather on the canarian archipelago 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.340
 that makes it in some 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.199
 southern europe to weather until 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.729
 weather warnings comes in 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.300
 Germany, Austria and Switzerland 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:15.150
 Everything is in the green area 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.390
 the solar eclipse was rather 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.760
 unexciting 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.050
 at least here in the eastern ruhr area 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.430
 the sky was cloudy and by the 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.010
 it was not synonymous light scattering 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.750
 really much darker mischief was 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.820
 but again the panic thing in front of you 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.690
 blackout due to lack of photovoltaic 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.070
 stream there it would have been during g 4 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.290
 geomagnetic storm blackouts 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:40.480
 I can not think of that yet 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:42.760
 can hear or read so much for 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.890
 Today I wish you one more 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.870
 nice and successful friday and 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.030
 a great start to the weekend 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.250
 keep your eyes open and your head high 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.000
 because this is the only way to be sure 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.000
 keep a look
