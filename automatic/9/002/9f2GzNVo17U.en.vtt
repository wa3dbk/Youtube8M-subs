00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.669 
few items to help set up my aquarium
like<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.900> Python<00:00:10.639> and<00:00:11.639> air<00:00:11.820> pump<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.679> some

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
like the Python and air pump and some

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:29.990 
like the Python and air pump and some
sand<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.260> air<00:00:28.439> pump<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> 2

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
sand so this was the air pump it was a 2

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.100 
sand so this was the air pump it was a 2
outlet<00:00:30.390> air<00:00:30.570> pump<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.890> think<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:33.110> 4:13

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
outlet air pump and I think it was 4:13

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.040 
outlet air pump and I think it was 4:13
through<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.559> hundred<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.640> hundred<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.809> six

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
through a hundred and a hundred and six

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.430 
through a hundred and a hundred and six
gallons<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:38.850> tank<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> 55<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.290> work

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
gallons so my tank was a 55 to work

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.119 
gallons so my tank was a 55 to work
perfectly<00:00:41.010> um<00:00:41.780> it<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.320> Pecha<00:00:43.620> brand

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
perfectly um it was just the Pecha brand

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.060 
perfectly um it was just the Pecha brand
so<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:45.239> was<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> cheapest<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.350> them<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.770> think

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
so it was a cheapest out of them I think

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.430 
so it was a cheapest out of them I think
it<00:00:47.190> was<00:00:47.280> extend<00:00:47.730> two<00:00:47.910> dollars<00:00:48.390> including<00:00:49.230> tax

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it was extend two dollars including tax

00:00:49.440 --> 00:01:00.439 
it was extend two dollars including tax
and<00:00:56.870> it<00:00:57.870> was<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.379> heavy<00:00:59.120> this<00:01:00.120> part

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
and it was really heavy this part

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.229 
and it was really heavy this part
because<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.050> was<00:01:01.170> partially<00:01:01.559> frozen<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.730> I'll

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
because it was partially frozen so I'll

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.520 
because it was partially frozen so I'll
show<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.510> later<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.320> another<00:01:04.769> video<00:01:05.100> I

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
show you later in another video I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.380 
show you later in another video I
decided<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.159> leave<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.790> sand

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
decided is just to leave the sand

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.719 
decided is just to leave the sand
because<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:10.049> too<00:01:10.229> heavy<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.530> pick<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
because it's too heavy to pick up so I

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.289 
because it's too heavy to pick up so I
started<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.570> Python<00:01:13.290> vacuum<00:01:13.860> cleaner

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
started with the Python vacuum cleaner

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.690 
started with the Python vacuum cleaner
so<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> no-spill<00:01:16.470> Python<00:01:17.250> vacuum

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
so this is the no-spill Python vacuum

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.109 
so this is the no-spill Python vacuum
cleaner<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.810> 50<00:01:19.170> feet<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.119> it's

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
cleaner and it was in 50 feet and it's

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.570 
cleaner and it was in 50 feet and it's
gonna<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:22.020> handy<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> 55

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
it was frozen so it was really heavy so

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.710 
it was frozen so it was really heavy so
I<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.250> had<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.610> let<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.820> thaw<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.659> I
