a two of the heads we have a four

Center<00:00:25.010> these<00:00:26.010> units<00:00:26.430> are<00:00:26.519> actually<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
Center these units are actually going to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.120 
Center these units are actually going to
a<00:00:27.210> large<00:00:27.570> window<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.710> door<00:00:28.859> manufacturer<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
a large window and door manufacturer I

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.209 
a large window and door manufacturer I
have<00:00:32.130> also<00:00:32.340> included<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.329> pneumatic<00:00:33.750> control

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
have also included a pneumatic control

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.690 
have also included a pneumatic control
and<00:00:35.360> it's<00:00:36.360> broken<00:00:36.570> down<00:00:36.899> into<00:00:37.370> two<00:00:38.370> separate

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and it's broken down into two separate

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.690 
and it's broken down into two separate
groups<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.149> each<00:00:39.329> pair<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.719> units<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.700> what

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
groups for each pair of units and what

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.670 
groups for each pair of units and what
we<00:00:41.820> normally<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.989> air<00:00:43.140> motors<00:00:43.469> it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
we normally do with the air motors it

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.590 
we normally do with the air motors it
actually<00:00:44.370> shut<00:00:44.670> off<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.090> air<00:00:45.210> motors<00:00:45.480> in

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
actually shut off the air motors in

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.350 
actually shut off the air motors in
between<00:00:45.930> cycles<00:00:46.579> just<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.210> air

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
between cycles just because the air

00:00:48.360 --> 00:01:04.920 
between cycles just because the air
motors<00:00:48.660> consume<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.200> much<00:00:49.260> air

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.440 

as<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.080> can<00:01:06.260> see<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.620> units<00:01:06.950> have<00:01:07.190> two<00:01:08.090> limits

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
as you can see the units have two limits

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.920 
as you can see the units have two limits
which<00:01:08.600> is<00:01:08.750> per<00:01:08.990> unit<00:01:10.270> one<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.450> for<00:01:11.630> proof<00:01:11.840> of

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
which is per unit one is for proof of

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.140 
which is per unit one is for proof of
extension<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.890> retract<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.490> unit<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:13.880> the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
extension to retract the unit and the

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.320 
extension to retract the unit and the
second<00:01:14.540> one<00:01:14.660> is<00:01:14.900> proof<00:01:15.620> of<00:01:15.740> return<00:01:16.160> to<00:01:17.000> shut

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
second one is proof of return to shut

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.910 
second one is proof of return to shut
the<00:01:17.450> air<00:01:17.600> motors<00:01:17.960> off<00:01:18.140> as<00:01:18.440> I<00:01:18.560> stated<00:01:18.770> earlier

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
the air motors off as I stated earlier

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.800 
the air motors off as I stated earlier
because<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:19.820> normally<00:01:19.940> shut<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.420> air<00:01:20.540> motors

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
because we normally shut the air motors

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.560 
because we normally shut the air motors
off<00:01:20.960> in<00:01:21.110> between<00:01:21.200> cycles<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:23.090> these<00:01:23.300> happen

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
off in between cycles and these happen

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.690 
off in between cycles and these happen
to<00:01:23.600> be<00:01:23.690> gas<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.229> air<00:01:24.350> motors<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:27.680> with<00:01:28.610> the

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
to be gas to air motors and with the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.120 
to be gas to air motors and with the
pneumatic<00:01:29.090> control<00:01:29.470> what<00:01:30.470> I<00:01:30.500> do<00:01:30.620> when<00:01:30.950> there's

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
pneumatic control what I do when there's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.850 
pneumatic control what I do when there's
multiple<00:01:31.310> units<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:32.030> stack<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.990> spool<00:01:33.380> valves

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
multiple units I stack the spool valves

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.800 
multiple units I stack the spool valves
or<00:01:33.979> four-way<00:01:34.340> valves<00:01:34.729> on<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.119> manifold<00:01:35.630> it

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
or four-way valves on to a manifold it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.410 
or four-way valves on to a manifold it
lets<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:36.530> makes<00:01:36.710> for<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.920> much<00:01:37.190> neater<00:01:37.580> assembly

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
lets it makes for a much neater assembly

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.460 
lets it makes for a much neater assembly
and<00:01:38.660> cleaner<00:01:39.650> looking<00:01:40.070> package<00:01:44.110> this<00:01:45.110> happens

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
and cleaner looking package this happens

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.330 
and cleaner looking package this happens
to<00:01:45.560> be<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:46.060> 3/4<00:01:47.060> inch<00:01:47.770> filter<00:01:48.770> regulator

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
to be a 3/4 inch filter regulator
