00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.130
 we are on the national road n327 between geldermalsen and beesd man 63 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.530
 from the gelderland zuid traffic police 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.460
 the couple seemed to have a quiet day ahead of them 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.459
 even these experienced agents will remember for a long time 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.220
 with at the court in Arnhem 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.449
 at first it seems to be a drunk driver 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.949
 but soon the situation turned out to be a very strange turn if there was even it 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.279
 cycle path for virtually invisible 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.390
 Nothing is less true 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.329
 here you can see how cyclists barely manage to manage themselves in safety 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.450
 bring 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.090
 the agents have plenty to see from a snack bar on the basis of driving behavior 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.370
 from this driver 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.630
 harlingen 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.580
 we have them all together 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 in the first instance it seems to stop 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.020
 the agents gave 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.020
 it's a very different approach 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.690
 original 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.870
 high speed 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.960
 while agents must go all out 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.330
 it should stick to it 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
 when the invigilators tried to catch up with the car 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.860
 deposited on the police car behind are a reward 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.380
 and that the pursuit continues both boards of the toyota 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.850
 got everything out of the closet 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.140
 that's why pursuers are playing a role that's why the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.470
 motorists' union around the ears 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.760
 wtf 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.500
 now we all get a game here 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.130
 the agents waited for assistance in the various people walking around if necessary 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.440
 to force to stop 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.110
 this is madness 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.110
 the boy suddenly parked by the side of the road 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 do you want to do 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.320
 you write it this year 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.979
 suppose you are 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.529
 9 and how much
