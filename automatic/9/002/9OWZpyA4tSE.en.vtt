those<00:00:33.149> four<00:00:33.480> blocks<00:00:33.750> are<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.050> two<00:00:34.260> sets<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.590> two

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
those four blocks are in two sets of two

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
those four blocks are in two sets of two
I'm<00:00:36.000> using<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.480> half<00:00:36.660> inch<00:00:36.840> router<00:00:37.170> bit<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
I'm using a half inch router bit and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.840 
I'm using a half inch router bit and
I've<00:00:38.579> got<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.879> set<00:00:39.239> up<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:41.180> jig

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
I've got it set up so that the jig

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.049 
I've got it set up so that the jig
taking<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.940> bit<00:00:45.090> closer<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:47.460> set<00:00:47.789> up<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
taking a bit closer is set up in the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.220 
taking a bit closer is set up in the
position<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:51.059> two<00:00:51.870> sets<00:00:52.140> of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
position as you can see the two sets of

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.880 
position as you can see the two sets of
two<00:00:52.469> offset<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.670> each<00:00:53.789> other<00:00:54.440> now<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.500> secret

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
two offset to each other now the secret

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.200 
two offset to each other now the secret
of<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.510> two<00:00:58.350> half<00:00:58.890> inch<00:00:59.210> cuts

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
of this is to get the two half inch cuts

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.740 
of this is to get the two half inch cuts
that<00:01:00.449> your<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.199> make

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
that your out is going to make

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.250 
that your out is going to make
completely<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.619> place<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.659> they're

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
completely in place so that they're

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.730 
completely in place so that they're
exactly<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.799> same<00:01:07.920> across<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.939> full<00:01:09.180> board

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
exactly the same across the full board

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.020 
exactly the same across the full board
so<00:01:10.740> as<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.549> looking<00:01:11.850> straight

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
so as you can see just looking straight

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.530 
so as you can see just looking straight

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.190 
on one side and on the other side isn't
for<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> 10<00:02:26.010> mil<00:02:26.250> bit<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.360> must<00:02:27.630> ensure<00:02:28.170> that

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
for a 10 mil bit so you must ensure that

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.270 
for a 10 mil bit so you must ensure that
you<00:02:28.530> use<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:29.220> part<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.510> jig<00:02:30.890> for<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
you use this part of the jig for the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.210 
you use this part of the jig for the
same<00:02:32.610> cut<00:02:32.910> I'm<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.360> 12<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.810> 5<00:02:34.050> mil<00:02:34.380> round

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
same cut I'm going to 12 and 5 mil round

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.490 
same cut I'm going to 12 and 5 mil round
bit<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.580> place<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.510> turn<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.810> up<00:02:36.959> slow<00:02:37.470> down

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
bit in place so you turn it up slow down

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.660 
bit in place so you turn it up slow down
so<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:38.430> exactly<00:02:38.850> opposite<00:02:40.130> place<00:02:41.130> back<00:02:41.400> down

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
so it's exactly opposite place back down

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.670 
so it's exactly opposite place back down
on<00:02:41.820> your<00:02:41.970> cheek<00:02:42.150> table<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.750> your<00:02:42.780> round<00:02:43.200> table

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
on your cheek table on your round table

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.220 
on your cheek table on your round table
and<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.489> turn<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.060> pieces<00:02:45.420> upside<00:02:45.690> down

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
and you turn it to pieces upside down

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.720 
and you turn it to pieces upside down
and<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.010> course<00:02:47.190> you're<00:02:47.340> going<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.489> have<00:02:47.610> to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and of course you're going to have to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.979 
and of course you're going to have to
shift<00:02:48.000> them<00:02:48.209> crosswise<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.480> in<00:02:51.480> sitting

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
shift them crosswise so that in sitting

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.620 
shift them crosswise so that in sitting
this<00:02:52.170> way<00:02:52.410> you'll<00:02:52.620> see<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.300> pile<00:02:54.600> is

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
this way you'll see that this pile is

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.050 
this way you'll see that this pile is
12.5<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.739> way<00:02:55.890> when<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.519> turn<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.880> up<00:02:57.030> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
12.5 that way when you turn it up the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.880 
12.5 that way when you turn it up the
other<00:02:57.269> way

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
other way

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.220 
other way
you've<00:02:58.890> got<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.160> then<00:02:59.420> unclamp<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.810> bring

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
you've got to then unclamp it and bring

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.190 
you've got to then unclamp it and bring
this<00:03:01.380> back<00:03:01.709> 12.5<00:03:02.549> this<00:03:02.730> way<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.810> you'll<00:03:03.989> have

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
this back 12.5 this way so you'll have

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.610 
this back 12.5 this way so you'll have
two<00:03:04.709> sections<00:03:05.190> aside<00:03:05.549> on<00:03:06.299> both<00:03:06.930> sides<00:03:07.290> and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
two sections aside on both sides and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.560 
two sections aside on both sides and
that'll<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> proper<00:03:08.640> back<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.329> front

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
that'll be a proper back and in front

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.130 
that'll be a proper back and in front
the<00:03:09.660> back<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.410> that's<00:03:10.620> how<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:10.980> sits<00:03:11.370> together

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
the back so that's how it sits together

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.539 
the back so that's how it sits together
now<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.170> just<00:03:13.709> thought<00:03:13.799> I'd<00:03:13.950> show<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.400> is

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
now I just thought I'd show you this is

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.370 
now I just thought I'd show you this is
our<00:03:14.670> dog<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.269> she<00:03:15.450> can't<00:03:15.690> help<00:03:15.870> me<00:03:15.989> because

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
our dog but she can't help me because

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.940 
our dog but she can't help me because
she's<00:03:16.530> deaf

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
she's deaf

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.729 
she's deaf
now<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:17.579> is<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.060> bottom<00:03:18.510> view<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:19.140> how

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
now this is just a bottom view of how

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.250 
now this is just a bottom view of how
the<00:03:19.799> router<00:03:20.190> sits<00:03:20.760> within<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.150> table<00:03:21.390> as<00:03:21.720> you

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
the router sits within the table as you

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.020 
the router sits within the table as you
can<00:03:22.380> see<00:03:22.620> I've<00:03:22.860> cut<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.570> slots<00:03:24.570> out<00:03:24.840> here<00:03:26.030> so

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
can see I've cut the slots out here so

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.120 
can see I've cut the slots out here so
the<00:03:27.209> router<00:03:27.390> will<00:03:27.600> sit<00:03:27.780> down<00:03:27.959> inside<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:29.010> I've

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
the router will sit down inside and I've

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.270 
the router will sit down inside and I've
also<00:03:29.390> cut<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.510> back<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.950> still

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
also cut it back so that it still

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.940 
also cut it back so that it still
supports<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.060> router<00:03:33.390> table<00:03:33.810> but<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.709> still

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
supports the router table but it still

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.370 
supports the router table but it still
lets<00:03:35.160> me<00:03:35.400> slide<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.269> finger<00:03:36.570> guide<00:03:36.780> backwards

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
lets me slide the finger guide backwards

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.800 
lets me slide the finger guide backwards
and<00:03:37.530> forwards<00:03:38.040> within<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.910> slots

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
and forwards within the slots

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.320 
and forwards within the slots
now<00:03:41.800> I<00:03:41.830> thought<00:03:42.069> long<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.310> hard<00:03:42.490> about<00:03:42.850> what<00:03:43.270> I

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
now I thought long and hard about what I

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.790 
now I thought long and hard about what I
do<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:44.140> brother

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
do a brother

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.850 
do a brother
Triton<00:03:45.760> workbench<00:03:46.240> and<00:03:46.420> it's<00:03:46.569> got<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.860> small

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
Triton workbench and it's got a small

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.199 
Triton workbench and it's got a small
set<00:03:48.100> up<00:03:48.220> in<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.490> I'm<00:03:48.610> forever<00:03:48.940> going

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
set up in and I'm forever going

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.840 
set up in and I'm forever going
backwards<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:49.870> forwards<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.290> vote<00:03:50.530> top<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:51.670> sit

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
backwards and forwards I vote top to sit

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.690 
backwards and forwards I vote top to sit
the<00:03:51.970> round<00:03:52.209> read<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:53.140> all<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.380> did<00:03:53.560> was<00:03:54.370> just

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
the round read so all I did was just

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.729 
the round read so all I did was just
used<00:03:55.030> one<00:03:55.420> see<00:03:57.390> fairly<00:03:58.390> inexpensive<00:03:59.260> tables

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
used one see fairly inexpensive tables

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.220 
used one see fairly inexpensive tables
from<00:03:59.950> banks<00:04:00.370> cut<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:01.420> top<00:04:01.660> out<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.020> two

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
from banks cut the top out of the two

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.320 
from banks cut the top out of the two
boards<00:04:02.680> that<00:04:02.860> are<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.459> supports<00:04:03.880> on<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.120> top

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
boards that are the supports on the top

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.660 
boards that are the supports on the top
to<00:04:05.080> fit<00:04:05.290> my<00:04:05.410> router<00:04:05.680> in<00:04:05.890> so<00:04:06.069> I<00:04:06.100> can<00:04:06.190> drop<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:06.580> in

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
to fit my router in so I can drop it in

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.360 
to fit my router in so I can drop it in
and<00:04:06.850> out<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.270> then<00:04:07.600> also<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:08.290> become<00:04:09.130> one<00:04:09.340> of

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
and out and then also a become one of

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.280 
and out and then also a become one of
the<00:04:09.489> boards<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:10.030> help<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.690> fingers<00:04:10.989> on<00:04:11.200> the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
the boards to help the fingers on the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.380 
the boards to help the fingers on the
slide<00:04:11.620> it's<00:04:12.220> as<00:04:12.370> simple<00:04:12.489> as<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:12.760> about<00:04:13.150> 30

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
slide it's as simple as that about 30

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.349 
slide it's as simple as that about 30
bucks<00:04:13.600> and<00:04:14.530> now<00:04:14.800> I've<00:04:14.920> got<00:04:15.070> myself<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.640> new

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
bucks and now I've got myself a new

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.199 
bucks and now I've got myself a new
router<00:04:16.690> table<00:04:17.230> as<00:04:17.350> well<00:04:17.579> so<00:04:18.579> all<00:04:18.940> well<00:04:19.090> and

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
router table as well so all well and
