00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:14.733
José Luis Várez Fisa is a great admirer of the Prado

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:22.767
and was one of its trustees between 1980 and 1986.

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:26.767
In January 2013 he and his family

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:30.333
decided to make a very generous donation to the Museum,

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:34.800
comprising 12 extremely interesting works of art.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.667
There are three from the late Romanesque period,

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:44.300
which in some cases point to the transition with the proto-Gothic.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.700
They are an altar frontal by the Master of Lluça, depicting Christ Pantocrator,

00:00:51.937 --> 00:00:54.210
and a series of scenes by a painter

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.866
from the circle of the Master of Lluça,

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:02.733
which is extremely unusual for its approach to colour.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.733
This another mural painting, again Catalan

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.300
(we previously had no Catalan mural paintings),

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.833
from San Esteve de Andorra.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.300
It depicts the opening episode in Christ’s Passion

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500
when Christ washed the Disciple’s feet.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.067
It is also a transitional work.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.267
The artist was notably influenced by the Byzantine world

00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:27.600
but there is probably also some influence from the Rhennish world,

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:32.033
as well as an evident change in the start of an interest in light

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:36.000
and in the use of different colours, pointing to the start of the Gothic world.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.433
A third Romanesque work is the altar frontal from Arnedillo in La Rioja,

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:45.433
of which none other survive and which also marks this new period

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:48.300
as it no longer follows the traditional formula for frontals,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.767
with the titular figure in the centre

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.433
and a series of episodes arranged on two levels on either side.

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:58.900
Rather we have two superimposed scenes

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.667
forming the subjects of “The Adoration of the Magi”

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:04.900
and “The Presentation of Christ in the Temple” over arcading.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.100
In addition, the artist does not limit himself to locating each one in an arch

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:13.733
as some of them invade the space to either side,

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:18.233
indicating a completely new idea of space

00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:20.967
and again pointing to what would be the start of the Gothic.

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:25.133
These are three extremely interesting works within the Romanesque.

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:31.300
With regard to the Gothic, this donation includes an exceptional work,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.467
which is The Virgin of Tobed.

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:40.000
This is an Italo-Gothic painting attributed to Jaume Serra.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.467
It is not so much interesting for the subject of “The Virgin of Humility”,

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:47.333
of which there was no previous example in the Prado,

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:52.600
but for its historical importance.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.067
This is a unique historical document.

00:02:55.267 --> 00:02:59.233
The donors are Enrique II of Trastámara,

00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:02.799
who would subsequently be King of Castile,

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.800
although here he is already depicted as crowned,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.900
 and his son Don Juan I of Castile, also crowned,

00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:12.067
with Enrique’s wife Juana Manuel and their daughter.

00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:17.500
The aesthetic and stylistic characteristics of this work

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.400
mean that it can be dated between 1359 and 1362.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.300
Enrique was not yet king at this date,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.600
but he was already referring to himself as such,

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:32.100
so this is a type of political propaganda,

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:37.967
a document in which he confronts his brother from Aragón

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.433
and proclaims himself king.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.900
Not just for his own claims, given that he was the illegitimate son of Alfonso XI,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.667
but also because of his wife, Juana Manuel,

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:54.000
who was Alfonso X el Sabio’s granddaughter on the one side

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.700
and great-granddaughter of Ferdinand III el Santo on the either.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.367
This is thus a unique image,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.000
the first portrait of a king of this dynasty shown in prayer,

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:08.900
in which the Royal Collection is so important,

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:11.633
and is an extremely interesting contribution.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.000
Among the Gothic work, other important ones are the carved wooden ceiling

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.733
and the altarpiece by the Master of Torralba.

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:27.333
This is an almost complete Aragonese altarpiece

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:33.633
in the International Gothic style but by a unique and highly original master,

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:40.567
an artist still working in a tradition dependent

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.733
on some Italo-Gothic models,

00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:44.800
but using an iconography that is so original

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.061
that the predella includes the only composition

00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:51.564
of Christ on the Route to Calvary known to me

00:04:51.764 --> 00:04:55.100
in which the Virgin supports Christ’s cross in the Byzantine manner,

00:04:55.533 --> 00:04:58.066
covering the hands with the mantle, 

00:04:58.266 --> 00:05:00.599
in addition to other extremely original compositional elements

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:07.400
which give this work a totally individual feel.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.367
There is also an outstanding altarpiece in relief from the late 13th

00:05:12.767 --> 00:05:16.267
depicting Saint John the Baptist within the traditional image

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:20.700
and with forms that recall choir books of the period,

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:28.100
with the castellated forms of each of the compartments that house the figures.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.667
This is also a unique work and of major importance due to its rarity

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.133
as almost none now survive.

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:36.700
Nor can we forget

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the two panels from the predella of an altarpiece by Pedro Berruguete.

00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:44.467
Berruguete is the key figure in Early Renaissance art

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:46.133
in the Kingdom of Castile.

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:48.133
The Museum previously did not possess a work of this type,

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:53.433
of a sort that depicts half-length figures

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:57.000
of such force and power,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.300
almost like portraits,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.933
 which recall the works that Berruguete had produced in Urbino.

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:06.267
We also have Diego de la Cruz, a Hispano-Flemish painter

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.300
who is the key figure in that school of painting from Burgos

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.400
and who worked with Gil de Siloe.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.071
This donation in fact includes a sculpture by Siloe,

00:06:16.467 --> 00:06:18.800
as it not only includes paintings, although they are fundamental,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.467
but also sculptures such as this Virgin and Child by Siloe.

00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:26.267
In the light of the importance and generosity

00:06:26.468 --> 00:06:28.667
of José Luis Várez Fisa and his family,

00:06:29.067 --> 00:06:33.533
the Museum’s Board of Trustees decided to devote a gallery

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.800
to the display of all paintings from the period between the Middle Ages

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.600
and the Early Renaissance

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:44.433
that were previously in his collection.

00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:49.000
Also on display are four long-term loans of works

00:06:49.433 --> 00:06:52.500
belonging to the Várez Fisa family.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.400
Displayed beneath the carved wooden ceiling,

00:06:56.767 --> 00:07:02.400
the result is not so much an island as a peninsula in the heart

00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:04.467
not just of the Villanueva Building

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:08.567
but of the area in which the Prado’s collection of Spanish painting

00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:16.000
from the Romanesque to the Renaissance is now displayed.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.200
