I'd like to show you how we can use the

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.830 
I'd like to show you how we can use the
Clipper<00:05:51.380> to<00:05:51.560> control<00:05:52.100> just<00:05:52.430> one<00:05:52.700> track<00:05:53.090> this

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
Clipper to control just one track this

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.920 
Clipper to control just one track this
in<00:05:54.140> in<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.980> Ableton<00:05:55.310> session<00:05:55.940> this<00:05:56.450> has<00:05:56.720> our

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
in in the Ableton session this has our

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.190 
in in the Ableton session this has our
drum<00:05:57.650> loops<00:05:57.950> and<00:05:58.850> it's<00:05:59.120> showing<00:05:59.450> here<00:05:59.870> in<00:06:00.050> this

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
drum loops and it's showing here in this

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.440 
drum loops and it's showing here in this
column<00:06:00.710> here<00:06:00.980> just<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.640> way<00:06:01.760> it<00:06:01.880> does<00:06:02.060> on<00:06:02.240> the

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
column here just the way it does on the

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.190 
column here just the way it does on the
screen<00:06:02.810> in<00:06:03.080> Ableton<00:06:03.940> also<00:06:04.940> you<00:06:05.570> notice<00:06:05.750> I<00:06:06.020> have

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
screen in Ableton also you notice I have

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.110 
screen in Ableton also you notice I have
this<00:06:06.380> group<00:06:06.650> of<00:06:06.800> keys<00:06:07.070> over<00:06:07.280> here<00:06:07.580> on<00:06:07.700> the<00:06:07.850> side

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
this group of keys over here on the side

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.990 
this group of keys over here on the side
all<00:06:08.930> of<00:06:09.200> these<00:06:09.350> can<00:06:09.650> be<00:06:09.680> used<00:06:09.980> just<00:06:10.100> to<00:06:10.490> control

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
all of these can be used just to control

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.790 
all of these can be used just to control
things<00:06:11.390> like<00:06:11.540> beat<00:06:11.900> repeats<00:06:12.380> and<00:06:12.620> other

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
things like beat repeats and other

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.580 
things like beat repeats and other
control<00:06:13.280> functions<00:06:13.820> in<00:06:14.090> live<00:06:14.480> they<00:06:15.410> don't

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
control functions in live they don't

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.340 
control functions in live they don't
need<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:16.010> play<00:06:16.360> musical<00:06:17.360> notes<00:06:17.630> but<00:06:17.960> certainly

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350
