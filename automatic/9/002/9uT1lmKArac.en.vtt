00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:21.550
 Alto 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:25.270
 It is still I thought that if no matter look at the track record because it is I tried a little conscious beginning to say 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.630
 31% and all I 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.689
 I'm Bronze is what 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.980
 Somehow we'd have won 12 schools a 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:40.630
 I feel sorry 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.630
 Oh , let's see and maybe this is the last thing 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:52.750
 The last thing that Ito sponsored was the last and probably was this 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.600
 Say g limit to defeat Endadora part 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.820
 To win by effort 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.070

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.560
 In Hia' 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:29.680

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.000
 Sniper showdown anon 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:38.330
 Doing sucking was read aloud think that help from a distance more than 50m 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.960
 Allowed to spawn the Dawn to help this certainly 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:49.670
 I feel that I made a device like a lot of public affairs automatically and fixed the skeleton and sold it. 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.070
 Toka Na that how also fixed doing help when I went to the real root from Masuda 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:57.060
 It is because it is thought 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.060
 Only it was or watching a little make something Well that 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:08.450
 Because there is still more to achieve in the future 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:13.110
 If you think about it, I think it will try to aim if it can be buried quite well, but it is still a track record release 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:17.620
 Because I don't feel like it's a stage to be rude 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.920
 I 'm thinking I'm going to play normal this way a little more 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.920

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.270
