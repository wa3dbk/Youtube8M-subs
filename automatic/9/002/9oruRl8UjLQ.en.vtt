00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.330
 Gabriela and realized lourdes 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.809
 that they could express their age in a way 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.120
 more specific if they used fractions to use 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.579
 fractions will allow them to calculate the 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.280
 difference between their ages in a way 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.710
 more accurate if Gabriela describes her age 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.900
 like fifteen and a half years 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.080
 fifteen and a half years and lourdes 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.529
 describes yours as seven years and seven 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.050
 twelfth how many years there is a difference 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.570
 or how many years are gabi and 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.719
 Lourdes writes the answer as a 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.250
 mixed number simplified ok then what 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.820
 they are asking us to say 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:45.050
 how many years are gabi and lourdes and 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:49.850
 javi is fifteen and a half years old 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.940
 and lourdes is 7 years old and 7 12 years old 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.760
 year then gabi is bigger than 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.140
 lourdes and to see how many years 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.260
 they carry what we have to do is 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.110
 subtract the two ages and how are numbers 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.100
 mixed here we already know that this is 15 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.860
 more a half less and in parentheses 77 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.740
 twelfth that ends up being minus 7 and 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.130
 minus 7 twelfths but if we look 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.660
 here is a means if we convert it to 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.539
 a fraction that has a denominator 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.990
 12 Actually what we have is 6 12 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.690
 bosh and 6 12 to 2 is smaller than 7 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.479
 twelfth then at the time of doing the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.660
 subtract here we will have an integer and 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.369
 then a negative fraction then in 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.740
 place to be doing all that relaxation 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.570
 that the integers lend 1 so that 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.000
 subtract with that fraction that has the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.190
 negative sign what we are going to do is 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.380
 convert these two numbers to fractions 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.179
 improper and so we do not have to do 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.230
 all that cambalache that lend us and 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.240
 the whole wave 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.210
 ok then let's do that we're going to 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.600
 convert it to improper fractions 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.340
 then 15 and a half at the time of 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.050
 turn the improper fraction what 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.230
 we have to do 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.560
 here we will be in the middle and here 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:11.120
 we have a 1 and that 1 we have to 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:15.019
 add 15 for 2 15 for 2 are 30 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.140
 plus the 1 that we already had yes because 15 in 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.720
 reality are 30 media and on the other hand 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.909
 Now let's turn this fraction into 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.970
 an improper fraction of ours 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:29.299
 denominator will be 12 to 2 and here this 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:34.700
 7 we will write it as 7 by 12 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:39.860
 between 12 and how much is 7 times 12 7 times 2 14 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:43.340
 we take 17 for 17 and 18 or 7 for 12 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:49.819
 is 84 and we have to add the 7 that 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:53.599
 we already had 0 84 7 how much is 91 then 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.470
 let's write here 91 and 30 plus one 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:00.230
 Well, it's 31 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.190
 31 and we have to subtract now for 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.599
 subtract these two improper fractions 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.540
 we have to make them have the same 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.090
 denominator and for that you have to find 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.090
 the least common multiple of these two 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.330
 things but that's very easy because the 2 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.180
 divide to 12 and 12 divide to 12 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.299
 then how these two numbers divide 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.250
 at 12th the 12th is a common multiple of the 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.830
 two and it's also the smallest that can 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.739
 have because here we have a 12 then 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:35.209
 our common denominator is going to be 12 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.099
 and here 12 and are being subtracted to see 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.959
 to move from this fraction to this 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.030
 fraction as we did nothing to the 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.299
 denominator we do not have to do anything 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.640
 the numerator and it happens simply in 91 and 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.069
 to move from this fraction to this 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.700
 fraction by how much do I need to multiply 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.519
 the 2 to give me 12 for 6 no 2 for 6 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.519
 are 12 and then I have to multiply 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:02.090
 the numerator for 6 that we have to pass 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:06.769
 from here to here multiplying by 6 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:12.060
 if it is that 31 by 6 how much is there to be 6 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:13.550
 1 are 6 6 by 3 18 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.330
 and ready 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.170
 and good the subtraction of these two fractions 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:24.550
 has the same denominator 12 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:29.440
 and in the numerator we have 186 minus 91 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:33.370
 to 6 we will subtract 1 and we have 5 and 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.840
 after 180 we're going to subtract 90 and we 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.890
 it's going to be 90 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.280
 then in total we will be 95 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:45.160
 then gabi is 95 12 years old 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.170
 more than lourdes ok this is the result 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.660
 of 15 years and a half minus 77 twelfths of 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.790
 years but they are asking us to 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.190
 write the answer as a number 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.530
 mixed simplified ok then we have 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.180
 to see how many of them are here like this 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:07.919
 is that we have to divide 95 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.080
 between 12 and good 12 times 8 is 96 so is 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.479
 that we already passed there but it's very 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.940
 close then I think it's going to be 7 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:22.710
 let's see let's see 7 by 2 14 4 and we're 17 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:26.910
 for 17 and 18 8 and we have to subtract this 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:32.370
 and what we have left are 5 minus 4 19 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:35.190
 minus 81 then 95 12 both are 7 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:40.100
 whole and we have left of residue 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:43.940
 11 so here's an 11 12 to you 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:47.440
 ok gabriela takes 7 years and 11 12 years 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.440
 from year to lourdes
