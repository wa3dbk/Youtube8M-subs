if it didn't matter they could have just
left<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> way<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.409> was<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:37.860> does<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
left it the way it was what does this

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.969 
left it the way it was what does this
change<00:01:38.430> mean<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.299> I'm<00:01:39.780> usually<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.680> board

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
change mean and I'm usually so on board

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.350 
change mean and I'm usually so on board
with<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.729> case<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.150> don't<00:01:42.210> think

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
with that but in this case I don't think

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.450 
with that but in this case I don't think
it<00:01:42.570> means<00:01:42.659> anything<00:01:42.920> maybe<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it means anything maybe it was just the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.039 
it means anything maybe it was just the
fact<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.759> after<00:01:44.970> acknowledging<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.750> series

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
fact that after acknowledging the series

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.569 
fact that after acknowledging the series
end<00:01:46.259> point<00:01:46.530> was<00:01:46.649> at<00:01:46.770> least<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.100> few<00:01:47.250> years<00:01:47.460> away

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
end point was at least a few years away

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.700 
end point was at least a few years away
they<00:01:48.210> realized<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.960> Nene<00:01:49.229> each<00:01:49.470> season

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
they realized that Nene each season

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.889 
they realized that Nene each season
finale<00:01:50.159> after<00:01:50.369> Jewish<00:01:50.850> baked<00:01:51.210> goods<00:01:51.540> could

get a little forced season one ended

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.090 
get a little forced season one ended
with<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.270> bagel<00:01:54.630> season<00:01:54.960> two<00:01:55.140> holla<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.860> this

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
with the bagel season two holla and this

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.580 
with the bagel season two holla and this
even<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.549> marked<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.360> matzah<00:01:57.840> but

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
even was marked to be the matzah but

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.080 
even was marked to be the matzah but
they<00:01:58.680> decided<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.159> ditch<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.369> tradition<00:01:59.969> and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
they decided to ditch that tradition and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.639 
they decided to ditch that tradition and
call<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> snake<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> mailbox<00:02:01.259> which

call it the snake in the mailbox which
they<00:02:01.799> say<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.159> good<00:02:02.399> metaphor<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
they say is a good metaphor for the
