card then you fold it goes good now way
and<00:00:29.510> that<00:00:30.510> way<00:00:32.090> so<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.870> square<00:00:36.290> fold

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and that way so that is the square fold

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.220 
and that way so that is the square fold
these<00:00:37.590> edges<00:00:39.469> into<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.890> corner<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.050> looks

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
these edges into the corner so it looks

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.160 
these edges into the corner so it looks
like<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.469> mini<00:00:43.890> square<00:00:45.829> turn<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.129> over<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:48.170> you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
like a mini square turn it over and you

00:00:49.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
like a mini square turn it over and you
the<00:00:50.070> same<00:00:50.460> thing<00:00:51.170> isn't<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.680> fun

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.170 

then<00:01:01.210> when<00:01:01.420> that's<00:01:01.780> going<00:01:02.700> turn<00:01:03.700> over<00:01:03.940> again

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
then when that's going turn over again

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:17.790 
then when that's going turn over again
and<00:01:07.180> this<00:01:07.990> this<00:01:08.320> is<00:01:08.500> square<00:01:16.080> when<00:01:17.080> you're<00:01:17.230> done

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
and this this is square when you're done

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.330 
and this this is square when you're done

that turn it over and then these corner

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.870 
that turn it over and then these corner
pockets<00:01:22.180> you<00:01:22.450> can<00:01:23.640> lift<00:01:24.640> up<00:01:24.910> from<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.630> middle

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
pockets you can lift up from the middle

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:37.819 
pockets you can lift up from the middle
like<00:01:27.880> so

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.310 

and<00:01:38.829> when<00:01:39.009> you<00:01:39.130> turn<00:01:39.430> that<00:01:39.670> turn<00:01:40.450> it<00:01:40.659> over<00:01:40.899> and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
and when you turn that turn it over and

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
lift up these flaps not this part and

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.820 
lift up these flaps not this part and
then<00:01:47.259> turn<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.430> back<00:01:48.490> over<00:01:50.640> undo<00:01:51.640> this<00:01:51.850> one<00:01:52.830> and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
then turn it back over undo this one and

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.380 
then turn it back over undo this one and
flip<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.460> over<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:56.170> turn<00:01:56.530> over<00:01:56.679> again<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:58.149> you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
flip it over to turn over again and you

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.810 
flip it over to turn over again and you
use<00:01:58.539> these<00:01:59.909> edges<00:02:00.909> to<00:02:01.350> push<00:02:02.350> in<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.649> middle<00:02:03.070> so

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
use these edges to push in the middle so

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.559 
use these edges to push in the middle so
that<00:02:03.850> makes<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.420> like<00:02:04.659> that<00:02:04.959> and<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.270> same

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
that makes it like that and do the same

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:16.520 
that makes it like that and do the same
thing<00:02:08.880> what's<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.000> other<00:02:10.239> side

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.190 

okay<00:02:17.530> we're<00:02:17.740> almost<00:02:17.860> done<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:19.600> fold<00:02:19.990> it

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
okay we're almost done you fold it

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.590 
okay we're almost done you fold it
almost<00:02:20.770> like<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.640> half<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.890> then<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.850> extra

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
almost like in half and then this extra

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.560 
almost like in half and then this extra
access<00:02:26.170> part<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:27.640> fold<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:30.420> then
