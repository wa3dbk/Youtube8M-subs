just fast I mean like overall I'm just
impressed<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> speed<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.079> because

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
impressed with the speed of it because

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.859 
impressed with the speed of it because
when<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.159> using<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.460> 9650<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.600> thing

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
when I was using the 9650 that thing

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.920 
when I was using the 9650 that thing
after<00:02:01.740> they<00:02:01.799> got<00:02:01.950> OS<00:02:02.310> 6<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.479> slowed<00:02:03.719> down

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
after they got OS 6 it just slowed down

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.920 
after they got OS 6 it just slowed down
to<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> crawl<00:02:04.640> that's<00:02:05.640> not<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.060> case<00:02:06.270> here

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to a crawl that's not the case here

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.780 
to a crawl that's not the case here
it's<00:02:07.770> got<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> 5<00:02:08.190> megapixel<00:02:08.520> camera

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
it's got a 5 megapixel camera

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.030 
it's got a 5 megapixel camera
which<00:02:11.790> works<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.300> well<00:02:12.569> rather<00:02:13.349> quick

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
which works out well rather quick

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.220 
which works out well rather quick
and<00:02:14.130> another<00:02:14.849> thing<00:02:15.090> would<00:02:15.599> unlike<00:02:15.989> most

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
and another thing would unlike most

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.890 
and another thing would unlike most
blackberries<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> past<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.660> one

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
blackberries in the past is this one

downfall I was giving this initially was

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.490 
downfall I was giving this initially was
the<00:03:19.440> price<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.160> t-mobile<00:03:20.810> when<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:21.840> got<00:03:22.230> this

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.460 
the only you know downfall I would say
it<00:03:38.970> was<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.450> price<00:03:39.690> because<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.049> it's

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
it was just a price because that it's

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.250 
it was just a price because that it's
not<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.859> rarely<00:03:41.370> competitive<00:03:41.940> price

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260
