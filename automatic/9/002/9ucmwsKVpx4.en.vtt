00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
number six what discipline do you ride

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.810 
number six what discipline do you ride
well<00:02:40.380> we<00:02:40.500> write<00:02:40.680> english<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:41.370> i<00:02:41.430> guess<00:02:41.610> the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
well we write english but i guess the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.230 
well we write english but i guess the
discipline<00:02:42.360> would<00:02:42.570> be<00:02:42.830> jumpers<00:02:43.830> yeah<00:02:44.820> we

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
discipline would be jumpers yeah we

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.030 
discipline would be jumpers yeah we
can't<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:45.510> do<00:02:45.750> like<00:02:45.870> general<00:02:46.350> jumping<00:02:46.860> but<00:02:47.010> i

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
can't just do like general jumping but i

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.340 
can't just do like general jumping but i
think<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.430> definitely<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.940> bit<00:02:48.360> more<00:02:48.900> geared

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
think it's definitely a bit more geared

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.050 
think it's definitely a bit more geared
towards<00:02:49.800> jumpers<00:02:50.660> but<00:02:51.800> yeah<00:02:52.800> that's<00:02:53.670> our

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
towards jumpers but yeah that's our

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.870 
towards jumpers but yeah that's our
disappointing<00:02:54.890> number<00:02:55.890> seven<00:02:56.459> what<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.730> your
