00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
it's really looking for and I'm glad

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.170 
it's really looking for and I'm glad
that<00:03:06.350> wasn't<00:03:06.770> in<00:03:06.860> binary<00:03:07.310> or<00:03:07.520> something<00:03:07.850> to<00:03:08.060> be

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
that wasn't in binary or something to be

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.970 
that wasn't in binary or something to be
honest<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.630> think<00:03:09.260> that's<00:03:09.530> quite<00:03:09.620> refreshing

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
honest I think that's quite refreshing

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.880 
honest I think that's quite refreshing
however<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.930> feels<00:03:12.200> quite<00:03:12.320> refreshing<00:03:12.650> your

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
however it feels quite refreshing your

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.000 
however it feels quite refreshing your
head<00:03:13.130> first<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.760> then<00:03:14.600> it<00:03:15.350> maintains<00:03:15.830> that

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
head first and then it maintains that

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.260 
head first and then it maintains that
we're<00:03:16.250> professionals

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
we're professionals

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.970 
we're professionals
however<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.170> has<00:03:18.290> something<00:03:18.620> like<00:03:18.710> this

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
however it has something like this

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.550 
however it has something like this
coming<00:03:19.250> through<00:03:19.430> at<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.580> end<00:03:19.610> yeah<00:03:20.560> it's

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
coming through at the end yeah it's

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.380 
coming through at the end yeah it's
still<00:03:21.800> got<00:03:21.860> it's<00:03:22.250> still<00:03:22.520> got<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:22.760> hoppy<00:03:23.030> bitter

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
still got it's still got a hoppy bitter

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.840 
still got it's still got a hoppy bitter
finish<00:03:23.690> which<00:03:24.560> which<00:03:24.920> we<00:03:25.160> really<00:03:25.550> didn't<00:03:25.700> want

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
finish which which we really didn't want

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.320 
finish which which we really didn't want
to<00:03:25.910> miss<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.180> one<00:03:26.390> so<00:03:26.930> then<00:03:27.110> leaving<00:03:27.350> running

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
to miss that one so then leaving running

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.910 
to miss that one so then leaving running
the<00:03:29.330> amount<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:29.960> flavor<00:03:30.260> we've<00:03:30.560> managed<00:03:30.890> to

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
the amount of flavor we've managed to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.560 
the amount of flavor we've managed to
get<00:03:31.070> on<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.400> is<00:03:31.610> really<00:03:32.150> really<00:03:32.420> surprising

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
get on that is really really surprising

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.870 
get on that is really really surprising
yeah<00:03:33.470> there's<00:03:33.860> loads<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.190> really<00:03:34.550> good<00:03:34.670> hop

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
yeah there's loads of really good hop

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.880 
yeah there's loads of really good hop
aroma<00:03:35.180> there<00:03:35.900> there's<00:03:36.110> a<00:03:36.200> banana<00:03:36.380> meanness

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
aroma there there's a banana meanness

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.070 
aroma there there's a banana meanness
which<00:03:37.070> I<00:03:37.220> question<00:03:37.730> what's<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.570> possibly

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
which I question what's the possibly

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.270 
which I question what's the possibly
steep<00:03:40.420> but<00:03:41.420> those<00:03:41.720> those<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.320> Melanie<00:03:42.770> and<00:03:43.100> a

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
steep but those those you Melanie and a

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.430 
steep but those those you Melanie and a
slight<00:03:43.630> savoriness<00:03:44.630> I<00:03:44.810> remember<00:03:45.230> when<00:03:45.410> we

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
slight savoriness I remember when we

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.870 
slight savoriness I remember when we
were<00:03:45.560> brewing<00:03:45.740> it<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.100> picked<00:03:46.280> up<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.550> little

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
were brewing it and picked up a little

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.370 
were brewing it and picked up a little
bit<00:03:47.000> of<00:03:47.090> basil<00:03:47.300> or<00:03:47.630> something<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:47.960> that

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
bit of basil or something like that

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.180 
bit of basil or something like that
that's<00:03:48.800> coming<00:03:49.160> through<00:03:50.080> but<00:03:51.080> I<00:03:51.320> don't<00:03:52.100> think

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
that's coming through but I don't think

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.010 
that's coming through but I don't think
I've<00:03:52.340> tasted<00:03:52.550> a<00:03:52.790> bit<00:03:52.940> of<00:03:53.060> 2.7<00:03:53.660> it's<00:03:53.780> got<00:03:53.900> like

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.360 
I've tasted a bit of 2.7 it's got like
that<00:03:54.200> much<00:03:54.410> flavor<00:03:56.590> now<00:03:57.590> this<00:03:57.770> is<00:03:57.920> bleed<00:03:58.250> with

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
that much flavor now this is bleed with

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.160 
that much flavor now this is bleed with
an<00:03:58.460> experimental<00:03:59.030> hop<00:03:59.390> as<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.660> explained<00:04:00.020> in

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
an experimental hop as I explained in

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.550 
an experimental hop as I explained in
the<00:04:00.200> video<00:04:00.500> in<00:04:00.620> which<00:04:00.650> we<00:04:00.770> breathe<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:03.380> you

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
the video in which we breathe it and you

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.960 
the video in which we breathe it and you
can<00:04:03.740> come<00:04:03.890> up<00:04:03.980> with<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.160> name<00:04:04.400> for<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.670> hop

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
can come up with a name for that hop

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.750 
can come up with a name for that hop
