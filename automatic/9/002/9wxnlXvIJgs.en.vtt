cigarette lighter and one thing that's
very<00:04:46.240> unusual<00:04:46.600> that<00:04:47.140> we<00:04:47.320> have<00:04:47.820> it<00:04:48.820> took<00:04:49.030> some

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
very unusual that we have it took some

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.450 
very unusual that we have it took some
doing<00:04:49.330> but<00:04:49.510> we've<00:04:49.810> got<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.230> and<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.280> works

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
doing but we've got it and and it works

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.300 
doing but we've got it and and it works
beautifully<00:04:52.050> this<00:04:53.050> is<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.290> fully<00:04:53.920> automatic
