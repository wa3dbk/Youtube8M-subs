00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.029
 so 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.450
 I want my life 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:21.760
 and on this occasion today 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.500
 I bring a video and how can you check the 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.840
 sad mind because they were already giving 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.760
 an idea about what is this video the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.440
 truth is that I have to do 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.720
 no video about this because I do not 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.250
 it interests me and it draws my attention in 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.440
 absolute but good I want 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.059
 share the idea is that out there 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.550
 I was seeing that some people to 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.920
 level taste see they went up then a video 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.720
 talking about this the truth not if it's 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.640
 true it would still be a rumor yes already 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.909
 I am confirmed the truth I do not know 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.830
 the truth does not interest me much if 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.640
 you do not know what this is about, you do not know 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.280
 I'm talking a little 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.620
 a few days ago and this rumor arose 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.800
 that they are a remastering of the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.220
 old one for the tenth anniversary of 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.000
 this saga , which is not good 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.460
 it's fine I say it's wrong but good and 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.700
 they're going to put some game modes in 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.230
 there is the 1 versus 1 with pure 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.350
 shotguns 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:24.120
 weird things but it is that the particular 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.120
 I'm not thrilled they come back 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.030
 the truth 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.740
 who seeks the achievement seek 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.789
 is to finish the campaigns all in super 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.640
 madness 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.649
 give in to neighboring coal and end up in the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.140
 The only one that fits is the course guards 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.250
 med which is still operating that his game 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.250
 shit but good 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.540
 to put some cinematic scenes to 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.150
 drench some areas of great 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.850
 specialization and will run follow the 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:08.520
 game at 60 frames that 1080 and all 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.410
 this good thing so that doing it more 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.870
 short I'm just going to do the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.630
 renationalization algersuari a little 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.630
 Anniversary supplies are 10 years old 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.130
 2016 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.130
 so 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.510
 good is a particular impulse that does not 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.070
 I will explain the moments I do not 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.320
 draws attention 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.200
 one imagines is a multiplayer of gears 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.520
 of war that one is not to return to the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.680
 slowness in the game as we are pretty 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.810
 accustomed to the agility to the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.810
 dexterity to software mobility 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.430
 three laws or guards are for 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.910
 return to what is being and the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.240
 software uno to that slow mobility with 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.160
 a super low etcetera the truth is that 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.290
 I would not enjoy it I do not think that 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.260
 you enjoy it, they are very 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.420
 fans of the campaign and so the truth does not 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.450
 I see a lot of joke that comes a game 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.720
 and why are these types of these things 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.580
 they cost a thousand pesos for something that 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.070
 you know something that already through 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.320
 small changes the wta us too 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.160
 super bastards if they do it then 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.040
 if it is directed by the truth being 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.189
 relatively 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.050
 all the basics just to give it 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.090
 Attention to extinction 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.020
 the truth I do not see it in any case the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.930
 it does not really appeal to me 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.530
 and that the branch deviated from the guaros 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:45.300
 that they would not like to return those 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.210
 times where the games 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.750
 multiplayer expect very basic from 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:56.080
 these movements warrior 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.350
 do something beyond that honestly 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.550
 I was not thrilled in the particular nothing of 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.520
 this type of games 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.410
 the wolf then with an excessive amount 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.840
 what is being a thousand pesos already 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.060
 They know that each new delivery for their 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.270
 pesos which cost me here in Mexico 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.270
 I go 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.459
 from somewhere else then there in more or 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.329
 less 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.340
 do the migration mix content 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.500
 local currency exchange because I do not know 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.900
 does not make courses just for me 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.600
 way one already confirmed that according to already 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.290
 they played a diet and 2000 being cause 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.620
 work of this dish and it is stated that 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.380
 he played it that is totally take one 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.480
 but with some successes of the truth 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.570
 well 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.330
 quite negative about it is this 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.990
 rumor are the 17 with training I do not know 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.690
 but there is no active comment 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.900
 I would like to tell me it's okay 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.390
 I would like to give my opinion as to be 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.170
 preferably unfocus a little 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:07.080
 more at the exit of howard 4 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.720
 so that really come 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.289
 more more agility this because the truth 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.449
 is that we already need new software 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.789
 definitely and we hope that soon 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.639
 see what we are going to give and the 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.650
 of three in question of god and we hope 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.659
 that there comes something about this from the 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.120
 remastering that group that being 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.740
 something about the new is science guys 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.689
 Well, I say goodbye, this video is 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.689
 moving to the final stretch is a small 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.690
 then calm talk so that they see 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.730
 you in common in what seems good to you 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.220
 they would not like what is necessary because he 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.110
 they see it well they see it badly etcetera not for 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.460
 always dismissals but before mentioning 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.050
 that here in the descriptions are all 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.780
 my social networks because go simple 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:58.660
 do not forget about hard to live and about 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:58.660
 everything that is totally safe 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.410
 ah
