00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
you also can find that scizor on the one

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.930 
you also can find that scizor on the one
minute<00:01:33.870> I<00:01:34.260> couldn't<00:01:34.830> find<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.610> took<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
minute I couldn't find it so it took a

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.200 
minute I couldn't find it so it took a
little<00:01:36.090> bit<00:01:36.300> longer<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.590> make<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.640> yeah

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
little bit longer to to make it but yeah

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.399 
little bit longer to to make it but yeah
this<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
this is it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.039 
this is it
it's<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.830> very<00:01:41.150> simple<00:01:42.380> simple<00:01:43.820> concept<00:01:44.900> but<00:01:45.900> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it's a very simple simple concept but it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.230 
it's a very simple simple concept but it
works<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.460> many<00:01:47.700> sorts<00:01:48.120> of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
works you can do it with many sorts of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240 
works you can do it with many sorts of
things<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.770> also<00:01:49.950> use<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
things you know I you can also use a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.490 
things you know I you can also use a
piece<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.670> wood<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.299> then<00:01:51.450> make<00:01:52.110> these<00:01:52.260> two

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
piece of wood and then make these two

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
piece of wood and then make these two
cards<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.070> then<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.640> will<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.150> tablet

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
cards and then you will have a tablet

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.840 
cards and then you will have a tablet
stand<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.650> that<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.549> my<00:01:57.180> thermal<00:01:57.810> stance<00:01:58.140> I

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
stand so that is my thermal stance I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:10.339 
stand so that is my thermal stance I
also<00:01:59.990> want<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.140> create<00:02:03.440> for<00:02:04.440> you<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:06.470> little<00:02:09.349> 3d

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
the things should look and how it should

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.360 
the things should look and how it should
work
