there's many pictures of grant reading
the<00:02:08.729> paper<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.539> assume<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.229> he<00:02:10.320> must<00:02:10.530> have

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the paper so I assume that he must have

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.020 
the paper so I assume that he must have
read<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.920> reports<00:02:11.340> as<00:02:11.490> well<00:02:11.670> which<00:02:11.850> is<00:02:11.880> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
read the reports as well which is the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.730 
read the reports as well which is the
kind<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.390> an<00:02:12.480> interesting<00:02:12.690> thought<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
kind of an interesting thought the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.070 
kind of an interesting thought the
atmosphere<00:02:14.370> seemed<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.000> rejuvenate<00:02:15.360> grants

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
atmosphere seemed to rejuvenate grants

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.200 
atmosphere seemed to rejuvenate grants
