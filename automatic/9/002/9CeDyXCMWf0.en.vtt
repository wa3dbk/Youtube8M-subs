00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 they are all proud of the channel like a shark 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.200
 and today we continue to play Fizza 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.630
 bist assembly and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.580
 card called crash landing 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.090
 actually this is super cool hardcore 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.570
 Mapo 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.100
 but you also like action 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.820
 passage how are we not quietly 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.740
 see here we are developing already 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.140
 ends and the food but I have some water 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.390
 could get I don't know maybe 10 more 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.200
 sapling-s to convert into water because 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.100
 I do n’t even know very little 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.420
 for now we see us locked in 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.200
 wrecked ship here we recycle dust 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.980
 in different 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.980
 resource ki is fine so now we have them 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.699
 throw off what we have in the end 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.699
 There is, in principle, not really a lot of things 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:14.880
 well, okay, I’ll probably do it anyway 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:18.090
 like that although no three times like this 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.440
 add some energy recycle everything 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.060
 so this is the whole thing so we have 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.610
 emergency reserves in the form of steep 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.340
 hawks so we ate and we generally 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.340
 all is well now just fine 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.600
 so we have hooks 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.210
 how many times do we have three or four 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:50.610
 plus pebble same 4 blessings let's check 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:52.560
 our tasks ki quests I can perform 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.510
 I can move but for that we need bones 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:02.640
 so far we have no bones and this is also 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:04.710
 I can not execute me at the moment 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.080
 urgently need zombies who me now 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.940
 will see her skeleton and I need archers 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.580
 very very much the way of this 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.200
 can 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.200
 at night, even to get a little dust 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:29.299
 useful where are you auto 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:32.760
 Come here once again my small 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:39.959
 it's bad crayons can sort and on 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:44.660
 kick me so i should kill him 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.660
 this goal i'm growing my excellent one ready 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.200
 see me coming but this is by the way 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.630
 well 30 years old and i see a few zombies and 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.180
 it will be dawn now so this 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.349
 very cool it's very cool 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.020
 stammering skeletons but it is very 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:15.920
 badly 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:22.870
 I need more bones than I do 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.870
 there are 27 fields or liquid than it is by the way 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.439
 okay full energy energy anyway 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.010
 it's not going anywhere 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:36.010
 We are typing here some water now it will be am 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:45.000
 cool plus some water 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.700
 fine, so far, in principle, everything is not very 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.130
 bad but serious enough me 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.650
 I need urgent problems urgently urgently 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.990
 wait for the morning to start growing trees 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.990
 in insane amounts just insane 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:07.380
 I hope I can do this to dig 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:17.130
 again whose damn was a lot 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:21.230
 I wait for assignments while dying in the afternoon sounds 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.020
 stop let's go numbers street collect 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.110
 heroic things that remained after 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:31.470
 monsters even fish gorilla sit here 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.290
 and did not expect this so okay we go to 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:39.630
 the street is a bunch of creepers on the street 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.020
 which is very bad for me but the bones 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.020
 OK 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:57.670
 damn quiet 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:05:01.290
 leave this seemingly peaceful he got me 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.290

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.270

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.710

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.390

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.740
 I did not understand how I died but apparently me 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.860
