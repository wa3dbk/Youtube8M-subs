00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
make it fit and then the flintlock

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.650

system<00:01:17.229> which<00:01:17.649> I<00:01:17.800> really<00:01:18.100> like<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:18.910> know<00:01:19.000> they

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
system which I really like you know they

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.150 
system which I really like you know they
went<00:01:19.240> from<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.660> twist<00:01:19.930> locks<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.740> flintlock

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
went from the twist locks to a flintlock

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.070 
went from the twist locks to a flintlock
and<00:01:21.640> now<00:01:21.700> they've<00:01:21.850> got<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.030> flintlock<00:01:22.300> Pro<00:01:22.720> and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
and now they've got a flintlock Pro and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.749 
and now they've got a flintlock Pro and
the<00:01:23.410> flintlock<00:01:23.710> Pro<00:01:24.009> works<00:01:24.310> really<00:01:24.610> really

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
the flintlock Pro works really really

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.180 
the flintlock Pro works really really
well<00:01:24.970> just<00:01:25.450> easily<00:01:25.990> flips<00:01:26.289> over<00:01:26.500> there's<00:01:27.070> an

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
well just easily flips over there's an

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.980 
well just easily flips over there's an
adjustment<00:01:27.610> on<00:01:27.789> a<00:01:27.910> screw<00:01:28.179> right<00:01:28.210> here<00:01:28.660> so<00:01:28.840> it's

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
adjustment on a screw right here so it's

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.960 
adjustment on a screw right here so it's
easily<00:01:29.229> accessible<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.610> actual

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
easily accessible and the actual

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.420 
easily accessible and the actual
flintlock<00:01:31.750> is<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.140> Clips<00:01:32.439> over<00:01:32.860> actually

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
flintlock is it Clips over actually

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.340 
flintlock is it Clips over actually
covers<00:01:33.759> up<00:01:33.790> that<00:01:33.939> screw<00:01:34.360> protects<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:35.290> it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
covers up that screw protects it so it

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.620 
covers up that screw protects it so it
doesn't<00:01:35.470> let<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.710> tighten<00:01:36.100> up<00:01:36.250> or<00:01:36.610> loosen<00:01:37.509> up

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
doesn't let it tighten up or loosen up

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.080 
doesn't let it tighten up or loosen up
and<00:01:37.840> really<00:01:38.590> protects<00:01:39.009> it<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.820> rest<00:01:39.970> of

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
and really protects it the rest of

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.640 
and really protects it the rest of
trekking<00:01:40.390> poles<00:01:40.570> pretty<00:01:40.930> much<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.229> same<00:01:41.409> as
