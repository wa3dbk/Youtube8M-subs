00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.819
 hello everyone how it takes several days 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.800
 sick with fever and with catarrh over 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.690
 that I can not stand it so today 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.030
 I bring a patrick Jordan responds 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.830
 remember that you can leave with the hashtag 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.199
 Pad for three cut responds 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.749
 your doubts and questions in any 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.419
 social network or well below this video 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:25.369
 to make next good videos we're going to 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.109
 and start with the first question 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.599
 patrick what do you think about washing your hair 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.339
 every day I do not recommend washing the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.590
 hair every day because they lose 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.050
 its natural oils but if the hair 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.730
 It goes dirty or you have a need 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.580
 first of all the hair has to be 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.530
 clean it would be ideal to wash it every two 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.570
 days so that the product does not accumulate 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.400
 in the hair and on the scalp if 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.320
 you want to wash it every day 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.810
 use a mild shampoo and most 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.520
 natural possible a natural remedy for 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.320
 darken the hair you can use 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.420
 some natural products for 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.870
 darken the hair progressively 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.760
 like the coffee sage the black tea or the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.129
 the only thing that you have to have is 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.200
 a little patience is true that if 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.270
 for a week you do massages in the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.700
 scalp with hot oils and 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.979
 you put your head 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.840
 you are not your hair much longer 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.460
 both perform massages on the leather 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.110
 scalp like putting the head mouth 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.270
 down activates blood circulation 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.700
 so it improves the growth of 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.560
 hair plus I always recommend that 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.810
 use hot oils for all 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.030
 its benefits but I do not think of a 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.130
 single week you do not have any change 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.899
 physical in your hair is true that 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.509
 If you have gray hair 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.610
 premature is not a step you can lie 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.100
 be calm because if you have us 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.750
 they are going to leave more gray I would like to know 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.939
 what dye can you use to cover the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.099
 gray because everyone I use does not 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.810
 they work if you use a colored bath 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:48.670
 you are not facing the faces maybe just 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.619
 you will get a small reflection you have 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.929
 than to use a dye but many times 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.640
 the problem is that water is not used 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.610
 oxygenated correct to make the mixture 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.890
 you have to use the one with 20 volumes and 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.899
 the ideal thing is to let it rest a little 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.579
 more than normal it is normal that the 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.340
 Short hair is always made more 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.079
 volume the short hair weighs less and is 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.479
 easier to work for that always 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:12.880
 It has more volume if the hair is long 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.680
 everything in one piece almost always loses 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.300
 all the volume especially in the part 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.100
 of 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.200
 if you have long hair and you want 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.690
 volume the best option is a cut to 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.210
 layers how can I lighten my hair without 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.530
 use chemicals or paint 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.150
 you can lighten your hair with 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.950
 natural products but you have to 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.990
 have a little patience because what 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.510
 progressively clarify 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.340
 you can use honey lemon the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.740
 cinnamon or chamomile 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.570
 the ideal is to apply it on the hair leaving to 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.030
 the street and the sun 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.090
 in this way they act much faster that 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.680
 yes they are natural products 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.960
 uncontrolled we never know in what 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.360
 color we will have the hair and also 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.910
 many times they tend to stay a little 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.340
 orange how to cut your hair which 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.050
 is your cut and how the combs to leave 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.490
 the line to the side and now it carries the 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.320
 hair paraded on the part of 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.690
 front and back are the ones given 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.940
 the four fingers to dry it I throw it 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.980
 all forward and I have consented 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.470
 against nest where he marked the line for 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.510
 get more volume another question is 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.850
 bad sleeping with wet hair or getting 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.290
 a braid and sleep so I do not recommend 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.450
 go to sleep with wet hair 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.310
 especially if you have a lot and 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.080
 much less if you do a ponytail or 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.480
 a 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.910
