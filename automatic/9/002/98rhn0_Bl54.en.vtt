on Earth let's look into this claim it's
actually<00:01:07.200> true<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.070> December<00:01:08.369> 21st<00:01:09.000> 2012

in this picture but will it cause any
problems<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:26.100> answer<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.549> question<00:01:27.060> let's

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
problems to answer this question let's

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.600 
problems to answer this question let's
see<00:01:27.900> how<00:01:28.049> these<00:01:28.259> three<00:01:28.590> objects<00:01:29.040> normally

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
see how these three objects normally

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.819 
see how these three objects normally
interact<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.240> each<00:01:30.329> other<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:31.439> probably

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
interact with each other you probably

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.499 
interact with each other you probably
already<00:01:32.070> know<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.430> Earth<00:01:32.790> orbits<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> Sun

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
already know that Earth orbits the Sun

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.660 
already know that Earth orbits the Sun
and<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.409> orbit<00:01:34.770> takes<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.250> year<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and that this orbit takes one year to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.969 
and that this orbit takes one year to
complete<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:36.750> probably<00:01:37.140> also<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.890> our

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
complete you probably also know that our

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.010 
complete you probably also know that our
solar<00:01:38.280> system<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.909> part<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> Milky<00:01:39.840> Way

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
solar system is part of the Milky Way

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.499 
solar system is part of the Milky Way
galaxy<00:01:40.280> astronomers<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.939> detected<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
galaxy astronomers have detected a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.719 
galaxy astronomers have detected a
supermassive<00:01:43.020> black<00:01:43.049> hole<00:01:43.560> at<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.100> center<00:01:44.579> of

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
supermassive black hole at the center of

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.569 
supermassive black hole at the center of
our<00:01:44.820> galaxy<00:01:45.619> just<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> earth<00:01:47.130> travels

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
our galaxy just like the earth travels

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.670 
our galaxy just like the earth travels
around<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> Sun<00:01:48.180> our<00:01:48.479> Sun<00:01:48.780> also<00:01:49.259> travels

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
around the Sun our Sun also travels

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.980 
around the Sun our Sun also travels
around<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.130> black<00:01:50.399> hole<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.360> takes<00:01:51.570> much

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
around this black hole but it takes much

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
around this black hole but it takes much
much<00:01:52.350> longer<00:01:52.649> about<00:01:53.450> 225<00:01:54.450> million<00:01:54.899> years<00:01:55.610> so

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
much longer about 225 million years so

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.209 
much longer about 225 million years so
let's<00:01:56.759> combine<00:01:57.030> these<00:01:57.360> two<00:01:57.630> orbits<00:01:58.049> first<00:01:59.009> we

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
let's combine these two orbits first we

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.039 
let's combine these two orbits first we
need<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.579> able<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.909> see<00:02:00.090> our<00:02:00.329> Sun<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
need to be able to see our Sun and the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.170 
need to be able to see our Sun and the
earth<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.950> let's<00:02:02.130> make<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.490> objects<00:02:02.939> larger

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
earth so let's make these objects larger

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.770 
earth so let's make these objects larger
than<00:02:03.509> they<00:02:03.659> really<00:02:03.960> are<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:05.219> 2012<00:02:06.060> claim<00:02:06.420> says

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
than they really are the 2012 claim says

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.180 
than they really are the 2012 claim says
that<00:02:06.990> there<00:02:07.140> will<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.290> an<00:02:07.469> alignment<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:08.009> these

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that there will be an alignment of these

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.219 
that there will be an alignment of these
three<00:02:08.489> objects<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.420> let's<00:02:09.629> start<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
three objects so let's start out on a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.410 
three objects so let's start out on a
line

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
line

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.520

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.260 
watches the earth and our Sun move
through<00:02:13.800> their<00:02:13.950> orbits<00:02:14.370> what<00:02:14.970> do<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.120> notice

through their orbits what do you notice

won't<00:02:28.770> be<00:02:28.860> any<00:02:29.010> different<00:02:29.460> than<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.760> December

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600
