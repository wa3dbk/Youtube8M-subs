00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
hey guys it's I n in this video I'm

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.509 
hey guys it's I n in this video I'm
going<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.110> show<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.320> how<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.620> assemble<00:00:13.950> and

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
going to show you how to assemble and

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.720 
going to show you how to assemble and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.980 
pickin up while datacron hunting this is
what<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.830> do<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.160> them<00:00:23.390> first<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
what you do with them first we have to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.009 
what you do with them first we have to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
temple ruins when you come out turn

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.450 
temple ruins when you come out turn
right<00:00:39.270> into<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.350> last<00:00:40.559> assembly<00:00:40.980> vault<00:00:43.460> in

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
right into the last assembly vault in

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.900 
right into the last assembly vault in
the<00:00:45.230> middle<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.129> matrix<00:00:47.489> cube

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the middle here is the matrix cube

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.970 
the middle here is the matrix cube
assembler<00:00:48.629> where<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.590> pick<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.950> your

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
assembler where you can pick up your

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.910 
assembler where you can pick up your
relic<00:00:50.520> after<00:00:51.000> you're<00:00:51.149> done<00:00:51.440> this<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
relic after you're done this is the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.130 
relic after you're done this is the
shower<00:00:53.129> input<00:00:53.640> panel<00:00:53.879> there's<00:00:54.629> three<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> them

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
shower input panel there's three of them

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.310 
shower input panel there's three of them
so<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:55.980> need<00:00:56.340> 3<00:00:56.670> matrix<00:00:57.180> shards<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.930> make<00:00:58.079> one

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so you need 3 matrix shards to make one

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.939 
so you need 3 matrix shards to make one
relic<00:00:58.940> according<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.210> link<00:01:00.449> below<00:01:00.949> one

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949

red and two blues will give me a 20 for

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.899 
red and two blues will give me a 20 for
endurance<00:01:05.970> 19<00:01:06.630> willpower<00:01:07.229> relic<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.189> I'm

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
it see to disassemble a matrix cube you

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.710 
it see to disassemble a matrix cube you
will<00:01:58.539> need<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:59.170> disassembler<00:02:00.130> core<00:02:00.580> there<00:02:01.569> are

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
will need a disassembler core there are

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.020 
will need a disassembler core there are
two<00:02:01.929> ways<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.200> get<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:02.740> one<00:02:03.220> is<00:02:03.460> through<00:02:03.819> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
two ways to get it one is through the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.910 
two ways to get it one is through the
Galactic<00:02:04.569> market<00:02:05.020> cause<00:02:07.019> you<00:02:08.019> can<00:02:08.259> also<00:02:08.470> get

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920
