 impeccable and today we find ourselves 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.340
 for the second episode of the series 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.650
 fatal guys I really care about you 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.960
 thank for your many votes during 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.820
 from the first the first video a jld 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.980
 had put so both pairs 1 and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.949
 many of you voted for the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 binomial lead second form and pogba and to 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.270
 it suits me guys this was it 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.579
 binomial that I really wanted to use 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.680
 in this series so I put the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.930
 players in the team so already that we 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.920
 do that that makes us his players in 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.840
 more in the team 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.760
 and all the better, especially since it's 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.920
 players that I like and at this 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.440
 first of that first match in this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.329
 episode of match by episode we go 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.140
 fall against a beautiful link with 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.710
 wolf box of lacazette ferreira carrasco 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.690
 after that a team a nice team 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.339
 and it started well for us 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.840
 first opportunity with kakuta we go 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.720
 enter the surface the strike of the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.880
 left pushed back by the guardian and that's it 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.189
 pogba sets up and ideally placed 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.140
 and which allows us to register the first 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.130
 goal fast enough in the match so 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.900
 that's pretty good 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.119
 we will have a second opportunity with 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.590
 sadly leave the left foot 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.509
 it's not his strong foot so suddenly the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.320
 typing is not necessarily the most 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.080
 interesting 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.759
 ben arfa on the left side we go 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.829
 enter the surface the strike 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.829
 rolled up well repulsed by the keeper of 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.329
 goal on the head there was offside 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.430
 always blessed late I really pushed 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.820
 with the player the key player 1 of this 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.829
 series 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.649
 unfortunately I stumbled on a new 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.990
 times on the guard always ben arfa 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.430
 really untenable but unfortunately 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.110
 which lacks a little bit of finishing the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.310
 look at the disgusting hit yet 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.990
 there was still more than half 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.369
 of the gauge unfortunately it's 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.450
 really too little power for 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.700
 worry the caretaker we will spend 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.070
 directly in the second half a beautiful 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.899
 collective game we will find ben arfa 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.610
 the scoop turn the chained hit 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.600
 unfortunately it's not framed 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.050
 begins to do a lot 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.190
 at that moment of the match there I told myself that 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.990
 it really made a lot of used 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.490
 missed and I was already trying to 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.830
 plan to tell me damn it's going 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.600
 really be complicated by following 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.170
 simply to score goals with 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.240
 ben arfa 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.080
 it will not stop us anyway 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.400
 double the bet with kakuta 1 2 0 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.950
 So that moment of the match was 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.590
 really gained really more played 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.420
 very good to watch a that it regales 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.480
 really unfortunately ben arfa on 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.400
 always find a keeper's gloves 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.900
 and watch it when I tell you this is going 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.380
 to be hard with ben arfa even bad luck 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.660
 get involved 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.360
 the c6 and who puts the goal is not even 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.860
 ben arfa blow we have that we have only 35 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.950
 case in the kitty but hey okay 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.710
 finish by entering the millimeter opening 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.720
 of my player on medard fakih place a 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.490
 foot flat unstoppable 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.740
 which makes us 50 more cases in the 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.970
 kitty 4 0 at this time of the match 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.380
 Mass is said a last opportunity 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.850
 well stopped by goalkeeper and that's 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.400
 as well it will end this match a 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.440
 overwhelming victory 4 goals at 0 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.420
 unfortunately only one goal of ben 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.700
 arfa but hey it's good we still 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.080
 cumulated a lot of credit nothing in this 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.620
 first match have chained with the 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.320
 second game guys from this one episode 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.850
 second match that is going to be very tight and 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.410
 we will fall against an opponent with 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.430
 a really nice team a team 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.590
 as you can see from 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.020
 firstleague and there is a little bit of 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.090
 man does it's a little yahia mix of the 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.100
 bbva ya the players bundesliga 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.310
 Spanish 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.870
 the sterling also with a 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.000
 team on the paper that is 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.340
 interesting but not either 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.380
 impressive and we're going to have a 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.360
 opportunity directly from the 10th minute 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.200
 jérémy ménez we tried a lot 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.600
 strikes from afar 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.060
 during this match because the opponent 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.680
 defend is really very very good and 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.550
 really there was not a lot 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.959
 opportunities in this match 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.700
 watch ben benfa's curling keystroke 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.720
 which is still pretty much 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.970
 side of the frame cisse we will find bazus 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.959
 accuses the side defender I do not know 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.510
 what they were doing here we're going to shift 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.280
 kakuta we will give it to mazouna that we 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.280
 go a little bit knit we will clear 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.090
 an opponent to the strike from far away it gets 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.949
 closer but it's still not that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.900
 and there finally just before half time 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.340
 Jeremy do not make me attack what is 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.740
 what I say to myself I will try from afar 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.850
 and that makes that guys 35,000 credit of 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.729
 more in the pot 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.979
 a goal a goal fifa 15 1 the goalkeepers 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.389
 strawberries and suddenly he could see it 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.010
 if he was on his line but hey 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.479
 come back so I do not want to say that it's 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.130
 a nice goal but hey it's especially the 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.199
 goal that allows us to lead 1-0 and in 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.639
 the stride we almost doubled the 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.410
 setting with cisse the strike really 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.330
 monstrous of cisse who is really 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.340
 nice 1.6 and that's it a beautiful 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.979
 discovery 1 in this was 15 and for 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.449
 layer that really play with him there 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.100
 is rather physical he is rather fast 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.940
 there is a good finish there we tried 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.650
 a lob that will not give anything and really 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.669
 the opponent had had very little 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.289
 of opportunities in this match besides I 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.270
 believe that I have not put and we are 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.039
 the same has really tried from afar 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.750
 we tried a lot from a distance without 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.180
 really a lot of success ben arfa 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.340
 frozen almost not seen from the game here it's going 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.930
 to be one of his rare opportunities to watch 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.789
 to a beautiful action we have deleted three 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.900
 players hit it still pass enough 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:19.340
 clearly above lead we will find 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.550
 kakuta we go there to give back to lead a beautiful 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.200
 hymn 2 always to a two finally I 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.000
 wanted to try one one two no it did not 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.380
 market cissé trying strikes it 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.430
 touch the pole and suddenly it's like that 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.190
 that this match ends a victory 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.900
 short but a victory anyway 1 0 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.139
 it still allows us to accumulate 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.210
