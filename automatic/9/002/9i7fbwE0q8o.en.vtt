 mandolin size otherwise we could 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.030
 to do at most to the little economical knife to 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.650
 it works very well also more time 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.100
 that you make head with gattières it is 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.360
 already cooked 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.210
 it's a little con body but it's 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.130
 nickel bern I put them on a small 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.470
 flat plate to cool them more 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.780
 seasoning game but espelette pepper 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.610
 to do that then it's a novelty when 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.619
 even in recipes in the pure 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.350

 chopped raw like that the nudes as at 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.850

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.550
 cottage cheese or a small notebook 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.430

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.230
 life the accord keeps coriander 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.820
 could have been from the member of the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.100
 chives and it's in the pen to be 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.959

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.550
 name is harder and harder 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.150
 what to be clean after when you put 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.260
 in the verrine 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.060
 yeah because if you make traces 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.220
 after cleaning it's not easy tomorrow 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.420
 because if it was good to take more 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.790
