and<00:02:05.819> that<00:02:05.909> simply<00:02:06.240> reflected<00:02:06.749> the<00:02:06.840> fact<00:02:07.049> that

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
and that simply reflected the fact that

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.889 
and that simply reflected the fact that
their<00:02:07.770> currency<00:02:08.310> went<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.880> absolutely<00:02:09.420> zero

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
their currency went to absolutely zero

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.270 
their currency went to absolutely zero
we<00:02:10.050> see<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> same<00:02:10.470> thing<00:02:10.740> happening<00:02:11.160> in

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
we see the same thing happening in

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.410 
we see the same thing happening in
Zimbabwe<00:02:12.270> today<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:13.530> simply<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.190> not<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.760> not<00:02:14.819> I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.230 
Zimbabwe today it simply is not is not I
repeat<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:16.170> not<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> liquidity<00:02:17.070> crisis<00:02:17.760> we're

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
repeat is not a liquidity crisis we're

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.780 
repeat is not a liquidity crisis we're
broke<00:02:18.510> we're<00:02:18.870> dead<00:02:19.080> broke<00:02:19.350> all

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790

the<00:02:20.269> deficits<00:02:20.870> are<00:02:21.019> off<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.980> charts<00:02:22.400> now<00:02:23.090> once

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
the deficits are off the charts now once

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.420 
the deficits are off the charts now once
again<00:02:23.450> remember<00:02:23.900> earlier<00:02:24.230> we<00:02:24.799> said<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.340> you

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
again remember earlier we said that you

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.039 
again remember earlier we said that you
can't<00:02:25.670> trust<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.120> government<00:02:26.239> numbers<00:02:26.810> and

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
can't trust the government numbers and

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.259 
can't trust the government numbers and
so<00:02:27.500> when<00:02:27.650> they've<00:02:27.829> told<00:02:28.099> us<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.519> deficit<00:02:29.030> is

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
so when they've told us the deficit is

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.959 
so when they've told us the deficit is
200<00:02:30.079> billion<00:02:30.439> or<00:02:30.590> 300<00:02:31.069> billion<00:02:31.250> or<00:02:31.519> 400

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:31.969 
200 billion or 300 billion or 400

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.670 
200 billion or 300 billion or 400
billion<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.930> question<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.319> how<00:02:33.409> high<00:02:33.620> is

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
billion the question is how high is

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.589 
billion the question is how high is
really<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.280> deficit<00:02:34.700> well<00:02:34.909> when<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.569> look

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
really the deficit well when you look

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.890 
really the deficit well when you look
each<00:02:36.049> year<00:02:36.470> at<00:02:36.650> how<00:02:36.890> large<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:38.060> jump<00:02:38.450> in<00:02:38.659> the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
each year at how large the jump in the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.710 
each year at how large the jump in the
national<00:02:39.500> debt<00:02:39.799> is<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.970> pretty<00:02:41.239> much<00:02:41.450> tells

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
national debt is that pretty much tells

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.470 
national debt is that pretty much tells
you<00:02:42.019> what<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.439> deficit<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.359> well<00:02:44.359> the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
you what the deficit is well the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.780 
you what the deficit is well the
national<00:02:44.989> debt<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.409> the<00:02:45.530> last<00:02:45.739> 12<00:02:46.129> months<00:02:46.220> just

national debt in the last 12 months just

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.740

jumped<00:02:47.150> 1.5<00:02:48.139> trillion<00:02:48.829> dollars<00:02:49.579> now<00:02:50.480> that's

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
jumped 1.5 trillion dollars now that's

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.390 
jumped 1.5 trillion dollars now that's
the<00:02:50.989> real<00:02:51.170> deficit<00:02:51.680> how's<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.040> government

just<00:03:14.359> like<00:03:14.569> they<00:03:14.750> did<00:03:14.810> during<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.409> Great

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
just like they did during the Great

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.589 
just like they did during the Great

interest rates through most of the Great

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.740

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750

did<00:03:23.930> not<00:03:24.169> stop<00:03:24.530> their<00:03:24.889> 15-year<00:03:25.340> depression<00:03:26.060> so

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
did not stop their 15-year depression so

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.119 
did not stop their 15-year depression so
they're<00:03:26.690> they're<00:03:27.049> doing<00:03:27.379> that<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:27.949> they're

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
they're they're doing that but they're

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.770 
they're they're doing that but they're

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
running out of gas on that and so if

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.539 
running out of gas on that and so if
that's<00:03:29.900> not<00:03:30.139> going<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.349> help<00:03:30.470> what<00:03:31.040> can<00:03:31.250> we<00:03:31.400> do
