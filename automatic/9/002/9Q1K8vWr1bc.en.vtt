00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
second channel mainly because of the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.450 
second channel mainly because of the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
we're still growing and I think the main

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.999 
we're still growing and I think the main
reason<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.600> our<00:01:39.750> growth<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.320> stunted<00:01:40.500> as

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
reason that our growth is stunted as

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.660 
reason that our growth is stunted as
mainly<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.649> WWE<00:01:43.649> content<00:01:44.220> now

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
mainly because of the WWE content now
