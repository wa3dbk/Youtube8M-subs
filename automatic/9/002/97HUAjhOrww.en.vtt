every try and I don't know it's kind of
a<00:00:19.710> weird<00:00:19.980> shot<00:00:20.570> like<00:00:21.570> there<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:21.990> there's

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
a weird shot like there you go there's

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.410 
a weird shot like there you go there's
there<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.340> really<00:00:24.029> weird<00:00:24.210> out

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
there it is it's like really weird out

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.910 
there it is it's like really weird out
if<00:00:24.630> someone<00:00:24.990> hit<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> shot<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.590> would<00:00:25.800> be

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
if someone hit a shot of this would be

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.279 
if someone hit a shot of this would be
insane<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:27.539> since<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.930> goes<00:00:28.080> by<00:00:28.260> so

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
insane like but since it goes by so

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.929 
insane like but since it goes by so
quickly<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.920> could<00:00:29.130> really<00:00:29.279> only<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.640> someone

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
quickly I could really only see someone

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.580 
quickly I could really only see someone
hitting<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> fade<00:00:30.720> or<00:00:30.990> something<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.380> I

don't know I don't know maybe a tomahawk
shot<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.329> don't<00:00:36.329> know<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.590> know<00:00:38.149> bass<00:00:39.149> it's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
shot I don't know but you know bass it's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.290 
shot I don't know but you know bass it's
not<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.379> complicated<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.640> sounds<00:00:42.059> kind

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
not that it's complicated it sounds kind

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.030 
not that it's complicated it sounds kind
of<00:00:42.390> sounds<00:00:42.930> kind<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.170> complicated<00:00:43.320> when<00:00:43.950> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
of sounds kind of complicated when you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.920 
of sounds kind of complicated when you
do<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:45.390> not<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
do it but it's not really that

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.840 
do it but it's not really that
complicated<00:00:46.730> like<00:00:47.730> um<00:00:48.570> what's<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.469> called<00:00:49.850> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
complicated like um what's it called you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.869 
complicated like um what's it called you
just<00:00:51.199> first<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.860> don't<00:00:52.920> I'm<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.699> gonna

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
just first of all I don't I'm just gonna

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.459 
just first of all I don't I'm just gonna
put<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.510> don't<00:00:54.660> know<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.140> haven't

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
put this out here I don't know I haven't

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.389 
put this out here I don't know I haven't
tried<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> KS<00:00:56.489> g<00:00:56.760> KS<00:00:57.510> g<00:00:57.809> KS<00:00:58.770> g<00:00:59.039> or<00:00:59.219> any

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
tried it with a KS g KS g KS g or any

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.000 
tried it with a KS g KS g KS g or any
other<00:00:59.989> shotgun<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.199> I'm<00:01:01.350> pretty<00:01:01.620> sure<00:01:01.890> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
other shotgun but I'm pretty sure it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
other shotgun but I'm pretty sure it
only<00:01:02.160> works<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> rooming<00:01:02.940> ttan<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.329> don't

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
only works on the rooming ttan I don't

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.460 
only works on the rooming ttan I don't
know<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.970> just<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.299> try<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.600> yourself<00:01:06.689> maybe

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
know I just go and try it yourself maybe

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.810 
know I just go and try it yourself maybe
it<00:01:07.710> will<00:01:07.830> maybe<00:01:08.100> won't<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.500> yeah<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.950> but

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it will maybe won't and yeah so but

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.910 
it will maybe won't and yeah so but
basically<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.990> hard<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.710> with

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
basically it's not that hard to do with

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.499 
basically it's not that hard to do with
the<00:01:14.040> button<00:01:14.369> configuration<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.210> seems

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the button configuration this seems

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.910 
the button configuration this seems
might<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.200> may<00:01:16.350> seem<00:01:16.740> kind<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.189> um<00:01:18.920> complicated

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
might it may seem kind of um complicated

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.160 
might it may seem kind of um complicated
but<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.250> not<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> basically<00:01:21.900> all<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.110> need

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
but it's not so basically all you need

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.590 
but it's not so basically all you need
to<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.380> first<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.799> all<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.189> need<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.600> your

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to do first of all you need to have your

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.630 
to do first of all you need to have your
sniper<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:28.640> don't

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
sniper out like this and and don't

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.399 
sniper out like this and and don't
insist<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> switch<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.810> your<00:01:30.900> room<00:01:31.110> -<00:01:31.290> but

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
insist you switch to your room - but

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.060 
insist you switch to your room - but
don't<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> swap<00:01:32.100> because<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.150> won't<00:01:33.420> work

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
don't is to swap because it won't work

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.249 
don't is to swap because it won't work
so<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> need<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:36.150> your<00:01:36.329> DSR<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:36.960> and

so you need to have your DSR out and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.649 
so you need to have your DSR out and

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.629 
to do the super neck with the KSG and

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
and I couldn't ever get it to work so

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.969 
and I couldn't ever get it to work so
I'm<00:03:24.000> pretty<00:03:24.269> sure<00:03:24.449> it<00:03:24.599> won't<00:03:24.900> work<00:03:25.169> with<00:03:25.319> a<00:03:25.379> KSG

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979 
I'm pretty sure it won't work with a KSG

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.599 
I'm pretty sure it won't work with a KSG
so<00:03:26.729> and<00:03:27.440> I'm<00:03:28.440> hurt<00:03:28.739> I'm<00:03:28.919> also<00:03:29.159> pretty<00:03:29.489> sure

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
so and I'm hurt I'm also pretty sure

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.069 
so and I'm hurt I'm also pretty sure
don't<00:03:29.970> work<00:03:30.150> with<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.919> m12<00:03:31.919> or<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.609> S<00:03:33.540> or

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
don't work with the m12 or the S or

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.800 
don't work with the m12 or the S or
m1216<00:03:34.769> or<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.280> s12<00:03:35.669> mainly<00:03:36.269> because<00:03:36.419> they're

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
m1216 or the s12 mainly because they're

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.759 
m1216 or the s12 mainly because they're
not<00:03:38.090> pump-action<00:03:39.090> shotguns<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.169> I<00:03:40.470> think

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
not pump-action shotguns and I think

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.580 
not pump-action shotguns and I think
that<00:03:41.069> that's<00:03:41.250> kind<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.609> what<00:03:41.849> helps<00:03:42.780> do<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.199> and

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
that that's kind of what helps do it and

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.530 
that that's kind of what helps do it and
another<00:03:44.280> thing<00:03:44.400> that's<00:03:44.669> really<00:03:44.790> important

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
another thing that's really important

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.110
