00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
that when I'm going down the strand of

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.650 
that when I'm going down the strand of
my<00:02:12.930> hair<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:16.040> when<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.069> get<00:02:17.250> down<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.090> end

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
my hair and when I get down to the end

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.710 
my hair and when I get down to the end
of<00:02:18.989> my<00:02:19.230> hair<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:22.130> take<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.610> wrap<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.390> around

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
my finger pull it around and let it go

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.720 
my finger pull it around and let it go
and<00:02:30.799> then<00:02:31.799> it<00:02:32.069> shrivels<00:02:32.640> up<00:02:32.790> from<00:02:33.180> there<00:02:35.480> yeah

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
and then it shrivels up from there yeah

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.250 
and then it shrivels up from there yeah
so<00:02:38.730> I've<00:02:39.120> already<00:02:39.510> started<00:02:39.870> some<00:02:40.319> pieces<00:02:42.260> as

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
so I've already started some pieces as

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.080 
so I've already started some pieces as
you<00:02:43.349> can<00:02:43.560> tell<00:02:43.769> my<00:02:43.980> hair<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.280> drying<00:02:44.610> kind<00:02:45.000> of

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
you can tell my hair is drying kind of

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.089 
you can tell my hair is drying kind of
fast<00:02:45.329> now<00:02:45.569> I've<00:02:46.200> already<00:02:46.500> started<00:02:46.739> some

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
fast now I've already started some

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.800 
fast now I've already started some
pieces<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.700> I'm<00:02:47.760> pretty<00:02:47.910> sure<00:02:48.000> once<00:02:48.510> they<00:02:48.660> get

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
pieces and I'm pretty sure once they get

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.180 
pieces and I'm pretty sure once they get
done<00:02:49.019> these<00:02:49.260> are<00:02:49.290> going<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.590> be<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.739> lot<00:02:49.920> shorter

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
done these are going to be a lot shorter

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.839 
done these are going to be a lot shorter
than<00:02:50.489> what<00:02:50.670> they<00:02:50.849> look<00:02:51.090> like<00:02:51.120> now<00:02:51.590> but<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:53.010> don't

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
than what they look like now but I don't

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.210 
than what they look like now but I don't
mind<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.390> shrinkage<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.530> shrinkage<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.160> know

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
mind the shrinkage to shrinkage I know

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.670 
mind the shrinkage to shrinkage I know
it<00:02:56.459> comes<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.329> territory<00:02:58.200> so<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:03.209> then

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
it comes with the territory so and then

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.449 
it comes with the territory so and then
once<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.920> get<00:03:04.980> done<00:03:06.200> I'm<00:03:07.200> going<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.590> put<00:03:07.950> just<00:03:07.980> a

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
once I get done I'm going to put just a

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.580 
once I get done I'm going to put just a
