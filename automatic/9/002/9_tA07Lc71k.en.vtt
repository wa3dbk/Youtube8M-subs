00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.210 
of them I think it's really neat I
always<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:43.170> dug<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.439> truck<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.950> thought<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
was a neat little quirky thing that they

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.960 
was a neat little quirky thing that they
have<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.799> gets<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> job<00:01:47.250> done<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.759> looks

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
have and this gets the job done it looks

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.249 
have and this gets the job done it looks
kind<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.240> cheap<00:01:48.299> there's<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:48.899> really<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.140> whole

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
kind of cheap there's not really a whole

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.840 
kind of cheap there's not really a whole
lot<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> detail<00:01:49.950> wise<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.399> there<00:01:50.549> doesn't

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
lot to a detail wise but there doesn't

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.069 
lot to a detail wise but there doesn't
need<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.240> because<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.720> pretty<00:01:51.990> much

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
need to be because this is pretty much

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.080 
need to be because this is pretty much
how<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.409> looks<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.740> show<00:01:52.950> sans<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> little

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
how it looks in the show sans the little

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.510 
how it looks in the show sans the little
lines<00:01:54.299> for<00:01:54.509> transformation<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:56.100> yeah<00:01:56.280> that's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
lines for transformation so yeah that's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.100 
lines for transformation so yeah that's
really<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:56.969> does<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> rolls<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.899> sits

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
really all it does is it rolls and sits

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.959 
really all it does is it rolls and sits
there<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.320> looks<00:01:58.409> kind<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.740> neat<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.460> pretty

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
there and looks kind of neat but pretty

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:00.830 
there and looks kind of neat but pretty

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.430 
actually they are they're very secure on
there<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.400> very<00:02:55.580> simply<00:02:55.910> just<00:02:56.210> place<00:02:57.110> them<00:02:57.320> on

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
there and very simply just place them on

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.960 
there and very simply just place them on
here<00:02:57.470> there's<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:57.980> little<00:02:58.310> sliver<00:02:58.550> here<00:02:58.820> you

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
here there's this little sliver here you

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.420 
here there's this little sliver here you
happened<00:02:59.720> there<00:03:00.020> it's<00:03:00.620> very<00:03:00.740> very<00:03:01.130> simple

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
happened there it's very very simple

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.310 
happened there it's very very simple
this<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.450> going<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.720> become<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.050> missile

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
this is going to become the missile

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.840 
this is going to become the missile
holder<00:03:03.560> for<00:03:03.770> it<00:03:03.890> if<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.310> can<00:03:04.430> find<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.730> right

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
holder for it if I can find the right

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.510 
holder for it if I can find the right
area<00:03:05.360> there<00:03:05.600> we<00:03:05.690> go<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.710> you<00:03:06.740> get<00:03:06.980> six<00:03:07.190> missiles

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
area there we go so you get six missiles

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.880 
area there we go so you get six missiles
three<00:03:07.880> for<00:03:08.060> each<00:03:08.120> side<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:09.230> just<00:03:09.260> place<00:03:09.680> them

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
three for each side so just place them

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.470 
three for each side so just place them
in<00:03:10.100> here<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:14.510> we're<00:03:14.660> going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.840> want<00:03:15.020> this<00:03:15.260> to

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
in here so we're going to want this to

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.990 
in here so we're going to want this to
snap<00:03:17.480> in<00:03:17.690> here<00:03:18.520> there's<00:03:19.520> a<00:03:19.640> little<00:03:19.970> hole<00:03:20.150> so

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
snap in here there's a little hole so

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.790 
snap in here there's a little hole so
just<00:03:23.000> snap<00:03:23.209> that<00:03:23.240> on<00:03:23.420> there<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.320> you<00:03:24.680> get

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
just snap that on there and you get

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.460 
just snap that on there and you get
missiles<00:03:25.240> same<00:03:26.240> deal<00:03:26.450> for<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:26.750> side<00:03:27.020> just

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
missiles same deal for this side just

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:37.540 
missiles same deal for this side just
pull<00:03:27.740> this<00:03:27.890> out<00:03:29.500> place<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.650> missiles<00:03:30.980> in<00:03:36.550> and

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
pull this out place the missiles in and

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
a little peg and a hole here on the

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.060 
a little peg and a hole here on the
underside<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:41.959> this<00:03:42.140> wing<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:43.640> there<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.239> go

underside of this wing and there you go

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.990 
underside of this wing and there you go
something<00:03:46.070> falling<00:03:46.310> over<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.640> background

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
there is rooks spaceship pretty neat

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.440 
there is rooks spaceship pretty neat
looking<00:03:49.070> like<00:03:49.340> I<00:03:49.370> said<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.730> not<00:03:50.150> really<00:03:50.300> too

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
looking like I said it not really too

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.240 
looking like I said it not really too
much<00:03:50.540> too<00:03:50.780> insane<00:03:51.140> with<00:03:51.470> this<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:52.100> add<00:03:52.220> a

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
much too insane with this you add a

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.770 
much too insane with this you add a
little<00:03:52.520> color<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.820> it<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.150> got<00:03:53.300> some<00:03:53.450> orange

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
the transformation is really simple and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.479 
the transformation is really simple and
fun<00:04:03.200> obviously<00:04:03.440> very<00:04:03.860> simple<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.220> just<00:04:04.250> press

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.260 
little toy I think it's really cool the
way<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.770> transforms<00:04:48.130> instantly<00:04:48.819> it<00:04:49.210> looks

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
way it transforms instantly it looks

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.200 
way it transforms instantly it looks
decent<00:04:49.720> but<00:04:50.349> I<00:04:50.530> definitely<00:04:51.310> do<00:04:51.610> not<00:04:51.639> think

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
decent but I definitely do not think

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.659 
decent but I definitely do not think
that<00:04:52.479> it<00:04:52.870> is<00:04:52.900> worth<00:04:53.289> the<00:04:53.590> price<00:04:53.620> retail<00:04:54.400> I

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
that it is worth the price retail I

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.120 
that it is worth the price retail I
believe<00:04:55.479> it<00:04:55.720> started<00:04:56.110> out<00:04:56.199> as<00:04:56.349> 30<00:04:56.650> but<00:04:56.949> it<00:04:57.039> was

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
believe it started out as 30 but it was

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.420 
believe it started out as 30 but it was
25<00:04:57.610> at<00:04:58.000> Toys<00:04:58.210> R<00:04:58.360> Us<00:04:58.419> when<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:58.720> saw<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.280> it's<00:05:00.280> about

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
25 at Toys R Us when I saw it it's about

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.680 
25 at Toys R Us when I saw it it's about
a<00:05:00.490> couple<00:05:00.759> different<00:05:00.880> sales<00:05:01.300> for<00:05:01.509> a<00:05:01.539> few

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
a couple different sales for a few

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.570 
a couple different sales for a few
dollars<00:05:01.810> off<00:05:02.169> but<00:05:02.500> definitely<00:05:03.039> not<00:05:03.190> worth<00:05:03.400> it

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
dollars off but definitely not worth it

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.399 
dollars off but definitely not worth it
for<00:05:03.699> 25<00:05:04.120> or<00:05:04.270> 30<00:05:04.419> dollars<00:05:04.750> depending<00:05:05.050> on<00:05:05.259> where

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
for 25 or 30 dollars depending on where

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.399 
for 25 or 30 dollars depending on where
you<00:05:05.530> go<00:05:06.210> for<00:05:07.210> a<00:05:07.240> dollar<00:05:07.419> absolutely<00:05:08.169> yes<00:05:08.289> I

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
you go for a dollar absolutely yes I

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:09.930 
you go for a dollar absolutely yes I
thought<00:05:08.560> it<00:05:08.620> was<00:05:08.770> worth<00:05:08.860> it<00:05:09.130> maybe<00:05:09.669> for<00:05:09.909> a

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
thought it was worth it maybe for a

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.700 
thought it was worth it maybe for a
little<00:05:10.150> more<00:05:10.270> than<00:05:10.300> that<00:05:10.539> maybe<00:05:10.690> 10<00:05:10.960> 15<00:05:11.229> is<00:05:11.590> the

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
little more than that maybe 10 15 is the

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.499 
little more than that maybe 10 15 is the
most<00:05:11.949> I<00:05:12.250> would<00:05:12.310> say<00:05:12.580> it's<00:05:13.060> not<00:05:13.150> really<00:05:13.479> a

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
most I would say it's not really a

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.059 
most I would say it's not really a
must-have<00:05:13.900> thing<00:05:14.289> unless<00:05:14.470> you<00:05:14.650> really<00:05:14.830> want

all things been 10 it's nothing

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.420 
all things been 10 it's nothing

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430
