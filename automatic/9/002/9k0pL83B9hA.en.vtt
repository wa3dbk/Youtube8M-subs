00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.080
 all good family this week on tuesday 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.690
 do not upload any video therefore of 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.740
 follow-up one thing to do well is 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.740
 true what 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.599
 it's a tough week then they have 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.460
 I had time but now I have a couple of 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.630
 days off and I will dedicate them to the channel 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.800
 which means that we are going to face pair 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.150
 of couple of projects I will try to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.010
 prepare me some nice projects 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.169
 we are going to include even a tool 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.090
 You see that long but they 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.760
 I need now for a project that I'm going 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.800
 to do also in Libya then we go 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.420
 I'm going to do some little things 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.040
 let's do some resino let's 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.730
 do something small make tools 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.730
 here 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.040
 of week of week 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.239
 be a bit covered because also 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.700
 as another part not the truth that 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.250
 I need 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.250
 I need to go ahead as I can 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.440
 there are many of you and it seems to you 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.080
 through the page and send me a message 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.660
 form of the page that works very 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.030
 ok but if you do not put your address 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.650
 of mail correctly wrong is a 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.960
 way to put a space any 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.420
 story when taken I answer it 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.910
 measure the post mail and I can 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.630
 answering your questions is a pity 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:29.399
 I feel terrible when that happens 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:34.240
 yesterday the day before yesterday they were still tonight 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:36.490
 44 more and it 's a shame that you the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.950
 effort to have the doubt and send me and the 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.630
 email video all the time and adding 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.429
 half a turn and then I feel more bad 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.500
 that everything because it does not reach us and the doubt 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.420
 will continue on income and I imagine that the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.670
 Your feeling will be that you do not want 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.000
 to ignore and it's not like that is simply 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.880
 that the address is not why I 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.500
 I would recommend that you send me the email that 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.569
 is in the description of the videos that 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.920
 that works perfectly and if the email 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.780
 I get your address from me 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.490
 guard is also correct with what 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.530
 which there is no problem no 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.800
 I can answer with a loss of 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.900
 mutual effort 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.140
 and of doubt that remains unresolved that 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.690
 it's the most painful part I do not want 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.570
 No doubt to the extent of my 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.820
 possibilities you all know that I like 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.880
 answer everyone who solve them from 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.880
 possible I will not extend much 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.820
 today as I look at the weekend is going to 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.500
 be productive I hope it's very 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.460
 productive because I intend to 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.430
 close the door of the week 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.960
 I'm going to turn off the phone here to work 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.030
 for the channel and for you so 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.030
 I hope that some 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.560
 to see how 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.690
 I'm going to die 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.310
 to recommend the three videos as 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.210
 forever 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.260
 one is 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.210
 Normally when we all bake 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.690
 we tend to go making the pieces more 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.690
 big 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.620
 many people think that doing 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.580
 the largest dams means that 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.580
 we have more skill 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.290
 you were not really 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.480
 to be bigger pieces because it starts 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.480
 to big that those little ones each each 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.140
 piece to prove myself 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.670
 and in this case go and see how it is done 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.569
 a miniature Christmas ornament 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.890
 thumbnails 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.890
 the lathe of m 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.189
 it does everything save our fantastic 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.549
 he finished it said nutri the cough and that 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:52.629
 gives a spectacular double Christmas and so 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.210
 crime is not worth seeing it for 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.900
 what 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:02.250
 to a large extent the limitations of everything 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.050
 what many of you have, many of us have 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.489
 we may not be that we do not have 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.140
 the possibility of making large pieces 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.700
 but we do have the power to do that 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.010
 those little ones and you have to keep in mind 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.890
 that not everything should be family size 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.260
 you can make the size of the trios and 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.019
 very nice things are made in fact 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:25.110
 thread of this video I hope to be able to do 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.110
 some nice piecita 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.500
 then put it of everything recommended 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.500
 of the water 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.940
 the truth down after me 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.680
 and everything is good too 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.730
 everything has chained in the part of what 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:52.080
 I like this I was watching, share the 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:56.070
 side we had a lack already sent me a 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.180
 link to a to a tournament and carpenter 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.409
 Canadian 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.259
 it's called steven gerrard 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:07.169
 is a way that by the way is going to be a 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.719
 demonstration at the symposium of the 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:14.029
 association of orellana de tornero that 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:14.029
 do now in vehicle on day 25 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.920
 This is a great success and you dedicate them in 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:28.050
 boxes boxes and makes a few boxes that 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.599
 they take their breath are precious 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.550
 and I think that over there I'm going to come back a little 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.470
 let's recap a little bit 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.430
 and we're going to leave so much of this story 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.110
 story and we're going to do 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.930
 I want to do it while I like it 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.449
 to call this video inspired me a 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.409
 heap 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:51.750
 what quality has finished what wonder 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:55.310
 how little more down and finally 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.310
 when he is a boy that we have already 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.310
 state 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.999
 brawn 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:12.770
 is an artist of the questions of the 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:18.110
 resins makes some super bottle things 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:23.360
 with carton with cardboard a 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:25.180
 pretty face that can be done 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.219
 almost two is calm 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:32.050
 automatically and it says good 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:32.050
 you can use it 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:36.219
 it is impressive 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:49.710
 in this topic we are going to leave the week 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.710
