00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.550
 to the kids right now 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.859
 are doing morning reading 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.110
 our sheep are generally 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.820
 always on the pasture so in the morning 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.820
 at dawn they are brought back to the stable by 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.820
 milkers 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.660
 the music says automatic come into 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.300
 groups of 24 where it is distributed 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.610
 of the garden c during approximately 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.250
 summer period a net apiece at 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.519
 milking day while in the period 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.610
 winter and the integration with the garden yes 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.790
 increases because in fact the grass that 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.089
 can be found in pastures and below 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.970
 therefore the quantity of garden given is increased 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.190
 it does not turn into food and we arrive 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.320
 about the four goals each 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.020
 milking so twice a day 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.640
 the group of sheep from 24 enters the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:22.680
 catches and with and teats practically 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.680
 well it is milked automatically 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.280
 let's say milking speed e 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.250
 calibrated for the sheep because each type 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.890
 of animal to a milker demands one 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.590
 there are different milking or speed here 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.200
 a certain number of beats per minute and not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.850
 they are the same as the cow is a lot 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.590
 quicker for the sheep are a little 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.870
 more 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.229
 at the end of milking that lasts 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:53.520
 roughly for each sheep a 30 40 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.070
 seconds a little less than a minute 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.040
 sheep the catch is reopened and the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.960
 sheep glide through the slide 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.820
 in wood on the other side 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.400
 of the stable when the whole group of 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.830
 the good and dumb sheep 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.990
 they go out to the pasture and they will stay out until 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.150
 at this evening to guess they come 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.030
 brought back to the stable and repeats the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.980
 the same operation ends the milk 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.190
 product is deposited in a 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.400
 glass container in the room of the 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.900
 washing e 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.819
 hand filling the container 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.620
 contains about twenty 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.390
 books but thoughts and a hand 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.360
 pump empties it directly into the 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.329
 chiller in the dairy room 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.299
 in the processing rooms it will remain there 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.370
 until the evening milking took place 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.049
 will shrink and work it in the morning 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.670
 following that of the morning at 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.220
 we work together with the evening one 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.590
 generally refrigerated throughout 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.409
 the time of year we work once 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.180
 per day in the morning in periods such as 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.250
 this where we're going to 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.830
 end of milking sometimes we skip 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.530
 one day we work one day they hear no 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.360
 the themes therefore with four times milk of 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.010
 4 numbers 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.740
 they must when the act more or less these 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.230
 they are Sardinian sheep one breed from the others 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.240
 good producers another season 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.640
 they can also produce more than one liter 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.560
 day right now we are going towards 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.020
 there is some end of milking 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.060
 young sheep that gave birth to the 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.180
 Easter period therefore still maintains 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.940
 a good amount of milk but for the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.400
 more than the bulk of the crude has given birth 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.959
 for Christmas so to have daniel 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.510
 hofer natal for which we are already 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.190
 at the eighth ninth month expansion e 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.650
 so these are about the same 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.000
 half a liter a day while the nl 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.000
 still produce on the book 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.180
 it doesn't help me 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.280
 and robben 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.630
 they go from romania they are actually are 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.640
 of Hungarian ethnicity are gods 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.710
 the collaborators who are with us now 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.300
 for many years and also know the well 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.730
 kind of work because now 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.890
 to the experience 8 9 10 years someone 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.780
 but in short 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.640
 an experience of both working with 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.630
 sheep that work 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.410
 Italian tour 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.780
 I can cut myself the name is called 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.820
 he was stubborn too 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.340
 several years after that secret in short 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.500
 I worked like this 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.380
 they are young Italians if they are not found 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.060
 more despite milking now 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.060
 all is not mechanized film 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.970
 no 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:59.750
 at least you are good boldarino 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:05.259
 it always fights with destiny and to whom 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.259
 early morning panic 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.379
 there 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.970
 now the sardinia ball 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.460
 or they dive into the league 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:33.580
 the bank and appointed for life 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:38.610
 long face 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.610
 and so he designates it 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.900
 and thank goodness 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.550
 well 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.550
 now 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.920
 it happens instead 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.610
 but egypt 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.439
 no 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.439
 no 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.150
 is this 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.590
 Now 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.870
 murer will put 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.870
 he says opening 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.170
 Milan 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:47.960
 towards the camp you begin alone but that 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:51.500
 just a lot of wool in August 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.960
 some rattle 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.129
 there he is 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.309
 better this way 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:56.309
 beautiful 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:05.100
 You've never gone the source and the 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.300
 mouth full 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.300
 and while the day longer 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.509
 to me 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.509
 I see I see 

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:21.270
 here 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:26.750
 life and when 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.750
 the heart of ramona is not good
