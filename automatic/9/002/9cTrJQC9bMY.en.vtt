hi<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.319> Frank<00:00:01.680> Carmody<00:00:02.070> and<00:00:02.100> today<00:00:02.429> we're

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hi this is Frank Carmody and today we're

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.490 
hi this is Frank Carmody and today we're
going<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.820> take<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.030> look<00:00:03.240> at<00:00:03.419> how<00:00:03.540> constraints

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
going to take a look at how constraints

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.889 
going to take a look at how constraints
affect<00:00:05.460> our<00:00:05.640> sketching<00:00:06.150> so<00:00:06.330> I'm<00:00:06.450> gonna<00:00:06.600> open<00:00:06.720> a

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
affect our sketching so I'm gonna open a

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.140 
affect our sketching so I'm gonna open a
new<00:00:07.080> part<00:00:07.319> file<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.980> first<00:00:08.820> thing<00:00:08.940> I'm<00:00:09.030> gonna

right click show all constraints so here

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.349 
right click show all constraints so here
are<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> constraints<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.910> inventor

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
are the constraints that that inventor

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.780 
are the constraints that that inventor
is<00:00:30.480> placed<00:00:30.810> upon<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:32.189> drawing<00:00:32.489> here<00:00:32.669> you

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
is placed upon this the drawing here you

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.240 
is placed upon this the drawing here you
notice<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.210> these<00:00:33.840> two<00:00:34.170> lines<00:00:34.620> notice<00:00:35.160> when

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
notice that these two lines notice when

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.299 
notice that these two lines notice when
I<00:00:35.340> hover<00:00:35.370> over<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.800> parallel<00:00:37.800> constraint

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
I hover over the parallel constraint

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.440 
I hover over the parallel constraint
here<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.670> those<00:00:38.820> two<00:00:39.030> lines<00:00:39.180> are<00:00:39.360> marked

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
here that those two lines are marked

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.360 
here that those two lines are marked
parallel<00:00:40.020> these<00:00:40.410> two<00:00:40.710> lines<00:00:40.890> are<00:00:41.040> marked<00:00:41.160> as

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
parallel these two lines are marked as

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.369 
parallel these two lines are marked as
parallel<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.660> these<00:00:42.840> two<00:00:43.050> lines<00:00:43.079> are

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
parallel and then these two lines are

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.080 
parallel and then these two lines are
marked<00:00:43.620> as<00:00:43.710> perpendicular<00:00:44.430> constrained<00:00:44.969> is

marked as perpendicular constrained is

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.389 
marked as perpendicular constrained is
perpendicular<00:00:45.719> finally<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.710> top<00:00:46.950> line<00:00:47.190> is

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
perpendicular finally this top line is

constrained is horizontal now to get to
delete<00:00:50.070> constraints<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.789> actually<00:00:51.059> right

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
delete constraints we actually right

the X next to the constraints won't
delete<00:00:55.530> them<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.280> will<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.449> make

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
delete them it will actually just make

right rectangle now if I try to drag
this<00:01:05.400> corner<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:06.360> I'm<00:01:06.510> outside<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> tool<00:01:07.260> so

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
this corner now I'm outside of a tool so

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.109 
this corner now I'm outside of a tool so
I<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.560> drag<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> corner<00:01:08.100> notice<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> can

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
I can drag the corner notice that I can

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.840 
I can drag the corner notice that I can
drag<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.450> corner<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.110> shape<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.580> no

right<00:01:50.610> click<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> delete<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.540> constraints

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
right click and delete the constraints

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.420 
right click and delete the constraints
so<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.320> we're<00:01:52.500> drawing<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.159> very

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
so as we're drawing we have to be very

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.190 
so as we're drawing we have to be very
careful<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.350> notice<00:01:55.399> what<00:01:56.659> what<00:01:57.659> our<00:01:57.780> cursor

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
careful to notice what what our cursor

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.679 
careful to notice what what our cursor
changes<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:59.040> were<00:01:59.399> drawing<00:01:59.700> lines<00:02:00.030> so

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
changes to as were drawing lines so

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.350 
changes to as were drawing lines so
let's<00:02:00.719> go<00:02:00.990> ahead<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.259> we're<00:02:01.469> going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:02.360> just

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
let's go ahead and we're going to just

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.240 
let's go ahead and we're going to just
work<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> few<00:02:04.229> constraints<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:04.950> so

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
work with a few constraints here so

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.540 
work with a few constraints here so
we're<00:02:05.340> gonna<00:02:05.430> make<00:02:06.710> just<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.829> few<00:02:08.069> lines<00:02:08.280> we're

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
we're gonna make just a few lines we're

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.490 
we're gonna make just a few lines we're
gonna<00:02:08.640> make<00:02:08.879> five<00:02:09.599> lines

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.320 

okay<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.830> five<00:02:14.099> lines<00:02:14.459> we're<00:02:14.790> making<00:02:15.090> sure

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
okay just five lines we're making sure

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.970 
okay just five lines we're making sure
that<00:02:15.510> as<00:02:15.659> I'm<00:02:15.930> making<00:02:16.049> sure<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:16.500> draw<00:02:16.739> these

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
that as I'm making sure as I draw these

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.710 
that as I'm making sure as I draw these
lines<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.519> I'm<00:02:17.610> not<00:02:17.819> placing<00:02:18.569> any

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
lines that I'm not placing any

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.869 
lines that I'm not placing any
constraints<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.650> them<00:02:19.799> whatsoever<00:02:20.159> so<00:02:20.670> I

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
constraints on them whatsoever so I

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.759 
constraints on them whatsoever so I
wouldn't<00:02:21.599> click<00:02:21.810> here<00:02:22.140> because<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.560> would

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
wouldn't click here because that would

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.770 
wouldn't click here because that would
be<00:02:23.010> you'll<00:02:23.549> notice<00:02:23.909> that<00:02:24.060> my<00:02:24.180> cursor<00:02:24.239> shows

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
be you'll notice that my cursor shows

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.539 
be you'll notice that my cursor shows
that<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.049> would<00:02:25.349> be<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> parallel<00:02:26.069> constraint

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
that it would be a parallel constraint

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.289 
that it would be a parallel constraint
on<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.760> two<00:02:26.909> lines<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:28.230> right<00:02:28.500> click<00:02:28.530> done

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
on the two lines so I right click done

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.390 
on the two lines so I right click done
I'm<00:02:30.299> also<00:02:30.510> gonna<00:02:30.720> make<00:02:30.930> assert<00:02:31.319> two<00:02:32.269> circles

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
I'm also gonna make assert two circles

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.890 
I'm also gonna make assert two circles
okay<00:02:35.400> I'm<00:02:35.549> careful<00:02:36.090> not<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.480> line<00:02:36.660> up<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
okay I'm careful not to line up the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.360 
okay I'm careful not to line up the
center's<00:02:37.230> as<00:02:37.379> I<00:02:37.470> draw<00:02:37.739> because<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.129> want<00:02:38.310> to

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
center's as I draw because I want to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.839 
center's as I draw because I want to
show<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.910> constraints<00:02:39.480> themselves<00:02:40.049> and

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
show you the constraints themselves and

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.289 
show you the constraints themselves and
finally<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:42.500> final<00:02:43.500> line<00:02:43.890> okay<00:02:44.430> now<00:02:44.700> we're

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
finally a final line okay now we're

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.750 
finally a final line okay now we're
gonna<00:02:45.360> just<00:02:46.260> affect<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.010> drawing<00:02:47.280> using

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
gonna just affect this drawing using

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.520 
gonna just affect this drawing using
constraints<00:02:48.209> so<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.019> very<00:02:49.200> first<00:02:49.410> thing

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
constraints so the very first thing

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.400 
constraints so the very first thing
we're<00:02:49.739> going<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.220> make<00:02:51.170> two<00:02:52.170> lines

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
we're going to do is make two lines

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.460 
we're going to do is make two lines
parallel<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.879> to<00:02:54.450> make<00:02:54.599> two<00:02:54.780> lines<00:02:54.930> parallel<00:02:55.230> I

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
parallel so to make two lines parallel I

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.979 
parallel so to make two lines parallel I
would<00:02:55.650> click<00:02:55.829> here<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.359> you're<00:02:57.359> on<00:02:57.510> my<00:02:57.629> second

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
would click here and you're on my second

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.449 
would click here and you're on my second
line<00:02:58.109> now<00:02:58.500> those<00:02:58.709> lines<00:02:58.950> are<00:02:59.099> parallel<00:02:59.370> or<00:02:59.400> I

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
line now those lines are parallel or I

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.190 
line now those lines are parallel or I
can<00:02:59.640> right<00:02:59.879> click<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.209> show<00:03:00.569> constraints

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
can right click and show constraints

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.940 
can right click and show constraints
let's<00:03:01.859> right-click<00:03:02.269> done<00:03:03.269> right<00:03:04.140> click<00:03:04.470> show

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
let's right-click done right click show

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.650 
let's right-click done right click show
all<00:03:04.980> constraints<00:03:05.700> now<00:03:06.060> we<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:06.269> two<00:03:06.450> lines

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
all constraints now we have two lines

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.410 
all constraints now we have two lines
are<00:03:06.900> parallel<00:03:07.250> next<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.519> can<00:03:08.700> go<00:03:08.879> ahead<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.359> I

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
are parallel next I can go ahead and I

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.210 
are parallel next I can go ahead and I
can<00:03:09.569> make<00:03:09.720> one<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.019> those<00:03:10.109> lines<00:03:10.410> horizontal

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
can make one of those lines horizontal

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.470 
can make one of those lines horizontal
so<00:03:11.400> let's<00:03:11.549> go<00:03:11.700> ahead<00:03:11.790> I'm<00:03:12.000> going<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> click<00:03:12.329> the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
so let's go ahead I'm going to click the

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.050 
so let's go ahead I'm going to click the
horizontal<00:03:13.019> constraint<00:03:13.459> click<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.579> top<00:03:14.790> line

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
horizontal constraint click the top line

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.539 
horizontal constraint click the top line
now<00:03:15.540> those<00:03:15.780> lines<00:03:16.049> are<00:03:16.260> both<00:03:16.650> horizontal

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
now those lines are both horizontal

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.940 
now those lines are both horizontal
because<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.450> top<00:03:18.660> line<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:18.959> constrained<00:03:19.859> to

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
because the top line is constrained to

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.979 
because the top line is constrained to
be<00:03:20.040> horizontal<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.299> bottom<00:03:21.599> line<00:03:21.750> is

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
be horizontal and the bottom line is

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.849 
be horizontal and the bottom line is
constrained<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.500> be<00:03:22.669> parallel<00:03:24.410> okay<00:03:25.410> next<00:03:25.620> I'm

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
constrained to be parallel okay next I'm

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.099 
constrained to be parallel okay next I'm
going<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.069> make<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:27.269> line<00:03:27.510> vertical

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
going to make the this line vertical

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:36.010 
going to make the this line vertical
oops

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:44.490 

go<00:03:36.740> ahead<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.100> make<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:37.400> line<00:03:37.670> vertical

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.420 

they<00:03:45.500> went<00:03:45.680> wrong<00:03:45.800> there<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.160> I'm<00:03:46.220> gonna<00:03:46.340> go

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
they went wrong there so I'm gonna go

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.500 
they went wrong there so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:47.230> undo<00:03:49.000> let's<00:03:50.000> click<00:03:50.240> on<00:03:50.390> the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
ahead and undo let's click on the

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.510 
ahead and undo let's click on the
vertical<00:03:50.840> constraint<00:03:51.170> so<00:03:52.100> I'm<00:03:52.160> gonna<00:03:52.310> go

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
vertical constraint so I'm gonna go

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.970 
vertical constraint so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:52.790> I'd<00:03:52.940> notice<00:03:53.300> that<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:54.020> point<00:03:54.710> here

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
ahead I'd notice that the the point here

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.280

click the line now it's constrained to
be<00:04:05.150> vertical<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:05.870> I'm<00:04:06.410> gonna<00:04:06.530> go<00:04:06.740> ahead<00:04:06.860> and

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
be vertical and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.500 
be vertical and I'm gonna go ahead and
click<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.490> second<00:04:07.910> line<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.090> make<00:04:08.360> it

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
constraints ok so I have a vertical

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.070 
constraints ok so I have a vertical
constraint<00:04:22.670> and<00:04:22.790> a<00:04:23.120> perpendicular<00:04:23.720> katraine

next two constraints are going to look

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.400 
next two constraints are going to look
at<00:04:26.180> or<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.480> next<00:04:26.750> constraint<00:04:27.080> we're<00:04:27.230> going<00:04:27.350> to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.590 
at or the next constraint we're going to
use<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.950> make<00:04:28.280> two<00:04:28.520> lines<00:04:28.700> equal<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:29.480> this

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
use is to make two lines equal so this

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.240 
use is to make two lines equal so this
equal<00:04:30.020> constraint<00:04:30.290> makes<00:04:30.680> two<00:04:30.860> lines<00:04:31.100> of

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
tangent constraint so what I'm gonna do

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.930 
tangent constraint so what I'm gonna do
with<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:15.740> tangent<00:05:16.010> constraint<00:05:16.130> is<00:05:16.520> click<00:05:16.820> on

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
with the tangent constraint is click on

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.380 
with the tangent constraint is click on
one<00:05:17.000> line<00:05:17.540> and<00:05:17.960> one<00:05:18.830> circle<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:19.430> that<00:05:19.550> circle

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
one line and one circle and that circle

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.880 
one line and one circle and that circle
expands<00:05:21.200> to<00:05:21.470> be<00:05:21.590> tangent<00:05:22.250> with<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.300> line

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
expands to be tangent with the line

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.930 
expands to be tangent with the line
let's<00:05:24.890> see<00:05:25.010> how<00:05:25.190> I<00:05:25.220> can<00:05:25.490> do<00:05:25.580> that<00:05:25.730> differently

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
let's see how I can do that differently

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.640 
let's see how I can do that differently

click<00:05:42.320> the<00:05:42.530> line<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:42.950> then<00:05:43.040> the<00:05:43.130> circle<00:05:43.490> if<00:05:43.790> we

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
click the line and then the circle if we

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.170 
click the line and then the circle if we
had<00:05:44.720> first<00:05:45.350> click<00:05:46.190> the<00:05:46.220> dimension<00:05:46.910> and<00:05:47.060> with

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
had first click the dimension and with

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.310 
had first click the dimension and with
we'd<00:05:47.419> dimension

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
we'd dimension

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.050 
we'd dimension
circle<00:05:49.360> to<00:05:50.360> be<00:05:50.480> one<00:05:50.750> inch<00:05:51.670> let's<00:05:52.670> see<00:05:52.820> how<00:05:52.940> it

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
circle to be one inch let's see how it

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.750 
circle to be one inch let's see how it
reacts<00:05:53.360> differently<00:05:53.920> so<00:05:54.920> now<00:05:55.160> let's<00:05:55.460> take

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
reacts differently so now let's take

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.200 
reacts differently so now let's take
let's<00:05:56.420> go<00:05:56.720> ahead<00:05:56.810> and<00:05:57.110> and<00:05:57.940> define<00:05:58.940> the

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
let's go ahead and and define the

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.510 
let's go ahead and and define the
constraint<00:05:59.750> to<00:05:59.840> be<00:06:00.050> a<00:06:00.290> tangent<00:06:01.280> the<00:06:01.370> line

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
constraint to be a tangent the line

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.400 
constraint to be a tangent the line
tangent<00:06:01.940> a<00:06:01.970> circle<00:06:02.330> and<00:06:02.570> notice<00:06:03.170> that<00:06:03.290> the

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
tangent a circle and notice that the

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.160 
tangent a circle and notice that the
circle<00:06:03.680> actually<00:06:03.800> moves<00:06:04.250> to<00:06:04.670> the<00:06:04.850> line<00:06:05.090> but<00:06:06.050> it

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
circle actually moves to the line but it

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.680 
circle actually moves to the line but it
doesn't<00:06:06.500> expand<00:06:07.040> so<00:06:07.670> the<00:06:07.850> way<00:06:07.970> the<00:06:08.150> dimensions

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
doesn't expand so the way the dimensions

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.620 
doesn't expand so the way the dimensions
and<00:06:08.840> constraints<00:06:09.820> interact<00:06:10.820> can<00:06:11.270> often<00:06:11.510> be

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
and constraints interact can often be

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.270 
and constraints interact can often be
very<00:06:11.660> complicated<00:06:12.350> it's<00:06:12.740> best<00:06:12.950> just<00:06:13.040> to

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
very complicated it's best just to

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.940 
very complicated it's best just to
experiment<00:06:13.790> and<00:06:14.030> learn<00:06:14.090> them<00:06:14.480> on<00:06:14.630> your<00:06:14.810> own

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
experiment and learn them on your own

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.090 
experiment and learn them on your own
okay

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
okay

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.920 
okay
so<00:06:16.400> your<00:06:16.610> assignment<00:06:16.670> is<00:06:17.030> to<00:06:17.240> use<00:06:17.390> all<00:06:17.690> the

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
so your assignment is to use all the

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.660 
so your assignment is to use all the
current<00:06:18.230> constraints<00:06:18.710> you've<00:06:18.950> seen<00:06:19.160> here<00:06:19.460> in

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
current constraints you've seen here in

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.050 
current constraints you've seen here in
the<00:06:20.180> video<00:06:20.450> when<00:06:21.110> you're<00:06:21.350> when<00:06:22.310> you<00:06:22.430> finish<00:06:22.790> go

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
the video when you're when you finish go

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.640 
the video when you're when you finish go
ahead<00:06:23.270> and<00:06:23.450> save<00:06:25.450> okay<00:06:26.450> and<00:06:26.690> here<00:06:27.410> we're<00:06:27.620> going

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
ahead and save okay and here we're going

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.550 
ahead and save okay and here we're going

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.890 
to go ahead we're gonna go mr. Carmody
underscore<00:06:31.010> constraints<00:06:31.490> and<00:06:31.670> save<00:06:32.000> I<00:06:32.390> do

want<00:06:33.170> to<00:06:33.260> replace<00:06:33.470> it<00:06:33.680> okay<00:06:34.430> now<00:06:34.610> it's<00:06:34.760> your

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
want to replace it okay now it's your

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.270 
want to replace it okay now it's your
turn<00:06:35.090> create<00:06:35.930> an<00:06:36.020> image<00:06:36.170> using<00:06:36.590> or<00:06:36.890> create<00:06:37.250> a
