00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:20.279
 game channel pixel world 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:22.050
 represents the first quarter of 2014 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.420
 maybe even the end of February or the beginning 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.430
 March, the world will see another horror 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.980
 which us so abundantly patches were in 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.720
 last year it's called daylight I'm in 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.489
 One of the past reviews already said that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.710
 in originality of course to developers 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.390
 can not refuse because they were already d-lite 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.730
 and dying light so don't confuse 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.350
 daylight will be customary for such 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.070
 the game genre surwaival horror from the first 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.930
 faces 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.940
 it is made in the tradition of amnesia and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.770
 slender but gameplay on most 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.590
 is like outlast that has done a lot 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.840
 noise last fall in the daylight us also 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.579
 to give birth to darkening corridors 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.620
 the hospital is only now in our hands 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.629
 there will be no camera omega pumped 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.969
 a phone that has everything from a flashlight 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.160
 before ultraviolet players will take over 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.680
 the role of sarah gwen girl who 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.960
 ochuhivaetsya 1 died daimon hospitals and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.909
 absolutely do not remember who she is and how here 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.770
 hit the goal of the game to get out 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.750
 unpleasant local in passing do two 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.670
 things restore your own memory and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.580
 find out what happened to the grim 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.650
 hospital developers from zombie studios 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.600
 already published a couple of facts regarding 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.700
 this place so in the late 30s 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.560
 the hospital urgently retooled 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.689
 morgue when close and and suffered 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.430
 tourist ship wreck with more 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.070
 than 1000 passengers on board 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.020
 and in 1948 the hospital suddenly 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.329
 closed when suddenly all disappeared from there 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.299
 patients and staff not even left 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.610
 records but since '83 on mid'e island 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.950
 has put the paw of the corporation investment for 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.939
 duty to turn an abandoned building 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.740
 first-class medical center for 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.509
 wealthy venture covered up 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.549
 copper basin and we only remain 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.680
 to detract from the fact that this fact 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.490
 largely copies the string 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.229
 outlast 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.850
 well and of course not without standard 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.710
 the story of how this place was tortured 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.180
 people put on no mix perrie cops 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.860
 now their souls run about 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.630
 dilapidated building 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.130
 all these and other facts as well 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.200
 the memories of sarah players will find out 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.979
 by all the same mega phone 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.019
 who will lodge some up 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.060
 hit and then he will start playing the video 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.620
 and audio fragments when approaching 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.360
 ghosts mobile phone starts on them 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.250
 respond with this including force 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.230
 turning off undead souls kill 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.730
 you can not therefore have to either run away 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.860
 either scare them with flares and 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.569
 reminiscent us with light bulbs although I 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.250
 totally not understanding how glowing 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.500
 sticks can scare the ghost 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.360
 still these bulbs along with ultraviolet 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.819
 phone will help other hidden message 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.530
 on the walls of the hospital except the creepy stories 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.579
 there will be information about 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.290
 how to get out of the building 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.450
 to orient in hands we will with 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.360
 using the compass built in all the same 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.920
 mega phone well, and as always I will try 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.900
 answer the unasked question of what 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.970
 such we will see another horror stories where 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.980
 shaking hands and 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.079
 gadget with night vision firstly it 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.560
 will be the first game made on the fourth 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.540
 andre le 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.280
 and the fact of course what happens on Gauguin yes 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.810
 and, in principle, it is already clear from the commercials that he 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.760
 somehow they donâ€™t pull on this 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.170
 next-gen but all the same it's intriguing to 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.910
 the second passage should take 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.769
 about half an hour and for more 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.319
 playability authors promise system 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.090
