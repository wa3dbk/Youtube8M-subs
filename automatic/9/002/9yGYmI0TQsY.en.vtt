00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
okay now the last sentence is our

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.040 
okay now the last sentence is our
conclusion<00:00:55.379> sentence

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.600 

and<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:01.600> conclusion<00:01:02.200> sentence<00:01:02.739> just<00:01:03.370> gives

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
us a supportive statements to those that

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.180 
us a supportive statements to those that
it<00:01:07.869> would<00:01:07.990> agree<00:01:08.290> with<00:01:08.470> point<00:01:08.770> of<00:01:08.860> view<00:01:08.950> number

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
it would agree with point of view number

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.010 
it would agree with point of view number
one<00:01:10.050> so<00:01:11.050> it's<00:01:11.260> a<00:01:11.800> supporting<00:01:12.520> statement<00:01:13.800> to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
one so it's a supporting statement to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.490 
one so it's a supporting statement to
those<00:01:17.020> who<00:01:17.770> agree<00:01:18.640> with<00:01:19.860> point<00:01:20.860> of<00:01:20.950> view<00:01:21.040> one

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
those who agree with point of view one

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.790 
those who agree with point of view one
so<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.580> example<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.840> might<00:01:25.050> say<00:01:25.110> something

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
so for example we might say something

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.410 
so for example we might say something
like<00:01:27.050> thus<00:01:28.050> it<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.530> understandable<00:01:29.280> why<00:01:30.030> many

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
like thus it is understandable why many

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.160 
like thus it is understandable why many
people<00:01:31.070> feel<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.400> McDonald's<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.810> great

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
restaurant now once again I'm using

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.010 
restaurant now once again I'm using
language<00:01:37.410> that<00:01:37.490> somewhat<00:01:38.490> distances<00:01:39.120> myself

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
language that somewhat distances myself

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.650 
language that somewhat distances myself
and<00:01:40.260> my<00:01:40.380> opinion<00:01:40.940> from<00:01:41.940> this<00:01:42.240> point<00:01:42.480> of<00:01:42.630> view

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
and my opinion from this point of view

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.480 
and my opinion from this point of view
I'm<00:01:43.020> saying<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.830> opinion<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.340> other

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490

I'm saying this is the opinion of other
people<00:01:44.910> and<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.270> understand<00:01:45.810> why<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:46.980> would

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
people and I understand why they would

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.680 
people and I understand why they would
think<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.520> great<00:01:47.760> restaurant<00:01:47.970> I'm<00:01:48.510> not

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
think it's a great restaurant I'm not

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.330 
think it's a great restaurant I'm not
saying<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.260> think<00:01:49.620> it's<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
saying that I think it's that but I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.590 
saying that I think it's that but I
understand<00:01:50.820> why<00:01:50.940> they<00:01:51.060> think<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:55.100> ok

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
understand why they think it's that ok

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.640 
understand why they think it's that ok
now<00:01:57.600> supporting<00:01:58.320> paragraph<00:01:58.800> 2<00:01:59.119> is<00:02:00.500> going<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
now supporting paragraph 2 is going to

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.100 
now supporting paragraph 2 is going to
talk<00:02:01.860> about<00:02:02.070> point<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.550> view<00:02:02.670> number<00:02:03.000> 2<00:02:03.180> which

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
talk about point of view number 2 which

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.200 
talk about point of view number 2 which
in<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.500> case<00:02:04.710> would<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.010> that<00:02:05.130> McDonald's<00:02:06.090> is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
in this case would be that McDonald's is

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.570 
in this case would be that McDonald's is
not<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.140> great<00:02:07.470> restaurant<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:09.920> think<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
not a great restaurant so I think it's a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.809 
not a great restaurant so I think it's a
little<00:02:12.510> bit<00:02:12.690> difficult<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.110> see

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.089 

okay<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.250> first<00:02:21.489> sentence<00:02:22.239> is<00:02:22.510> a

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
okay so the first sentence is a

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:31.190 
okay so the first sentence is a
statement<00:02:24.099> of<00:02:26.219> point<00:02:27.219> of<00:02:27.340> view<00:02:27.579> too

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.590 

the<00:02:31.650> second<00:02:32.100> being<00:02:32.280> an<00:02:32.700> example<00:02:33.410> and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
the second being an example and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.390 
the second being an example and
supporting<00:02:36.600> point<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.590> view<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:41.160> third

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
supporting point of view to the third

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.370 
supporting point of view to the third
being<00:02:41.730> once<00:02:42.000> again<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.330> discussion<00:02:42.810> sentence

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
being once again a discussion sentence

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.720 
being once again a discussion sentence
and<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:46.230> discussion<00:02:46.590> sentence<00:02:47.130> links<00:02:47.490> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and this discussion sentence links the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.480 
and this discussion sentence links the
example<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.780> point<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.260> view<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.590> with<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
example of point of view to with the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:58.070 
example of point of view to with the
statement<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:52.580> finally<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.790> conclusion<00:02:57.080> which

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
statement and finally a conclusion which

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.160 
statement and finally a conclusion which
once<00:02:58.320> again<00:02:59.000> shows<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.209> we<00:03:00.330> understand<00:03:00.900> why

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
once again shows that we understand why

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.310 
once again shows that we understand why
some<00:03:01.440> people<00:03:01.590> support<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.610> point<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.060> view

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
some people support this point of view

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
some people support this point of view
which<00:03:04.320> is<00:03:04.520> that<00:03:05.520> McDonald's<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.570> not<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.340> great

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
which is that McDonald's is not a great

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.000 
which is that McDonald's is not a great
restaurant

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.100 

okay

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
okay

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.770 
okay
so<00:03:15.920> thus<00:03:16.160> far<00:03:17.980> we<00:03:18.980> have<00:03:19.780> introduced

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
so thus far we have introduced

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.330 
so thus far we have introduced
introduced<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.440> two<00:03:21.590> points<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:22.010> view<00:03:22.160> and

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
introduced the two points of view and

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.510

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
we've supported both points of view now

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.910

essay<00:03:34.430> well<00:03:34.580> of<00:03:34.700> course<00:03:34.730> we'd<00:03:35.180> look<00:03:35.690> at<00:03:35.870> the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
essay well of course we'd look at the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.560 
essay well of course we'd look at the
negatives<00:03:36.590> as<00:03:36.800> well<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.250> both<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.390> these

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
topics but that's not going to be

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.640 
if we start talking about the negatives
and<00:03:49.790> that's<00:03:49.910> going<00:03:50.210> to<00:03:50.480> put<00:03:51.080> us<00:03:51.200> way<00:03:51.590> over<00:03:52.510> so

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
and that's going to put us way over so

and that's going to put us way over so
now<00:03:54.650> if<00:03:54.709> we<00:03:54.860> come<00:03:55.040> down<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.370> concluding

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
first one is a summary of points of view

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.990 
first one is a summary of points of view
analyzed<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:13.040> points<00:04:13.430> of<00:04:13.520> view<00:04:13.550> we<00:04:13.790> looked

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
analyzed so the points of view we looked

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.430 
analyzed so the points of view we looked
at<00:04:14.120> points<00:04:14.480> of<00:04:14.540> view<00:04:14.660> number<00:04:14.870> one<00:04:15.050> that

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
at points of view number one that

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.900 
at points of view number one that
support<00:04:15.830> McDonald's<00:04:16.310> points<00:04:16.549> of<00:04:16.609> view<00:04:16.700> number

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
support McDonald's points of view number

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.020 
support McDonald's points of view number
two<00:04:17.090> that<00:04:17.510> don't<00:04:17.750> support<00:04:17.989> McDonald's<00:04:19.030> this

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
two that don't support McDonald's this

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.840 
two that don't support McDonald's this
is<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.390> sentence<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.709> sort<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.130> summarizes

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
is a sentence that sort of summarizes

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.260 
is a sentence that sort of summarizes
those<00:04:23.570> two<00:04:23.930> areas<00:04:24.710> that<00:04:24.740> we<00:04:25.010> looked<00:04:25.250> at

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
those two areas that we looked at

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.550 
those two areas that we looked at
the<00:04:27.780> second<00:04:28.199> sentence<00:04:28.620> is<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:29.310> statement<00:04:29.880> of

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
the second sentence is a statement of

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.120 
the second sentence is a statement of
our<00:04:31.560> point<00:04:32.310> of<00:04:32.430> view

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.260 

so<00:04:37.830> we're<00:04:38.830> just<00:04:38.860> saying<00:04:39.220> whether<00:04:39.760> we<00:04:39.970> feel

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
so we're just saying whether we feel

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.020 
so we're just saying whether we feel
that<00:04:41.080> we<00:04:41.290> moreso<00:04:42.100> agree<00:04:42.400> with<00:04:42.520> point<00:04:42.760> of<00:04:42.880> view

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
that we moreso agree with point of view

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.640 
that we moreso agree with point of view
number<00:04:43.300> one<00:04:43.510> or<00:04:43.720> we<00:04:43.840> must<00:04:44.050> so<00:04:44.200> agree<00:04:44.500> with

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
number one or we must so agree with

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.830 
number one or we must so agree with
point<00:04:44.920> of<00:04:45.010> view<00:04:45.130> number<00:04:45.580> two<00:04:48.600> so<00:04:49.600> we've

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
point of view number two so we've

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.170 
point of view number two so we've
structured<00:04:50.140> this<00:04:50.320> as<00:04:50.500> something<00:04:50.800> like<00:04:51.180> after

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
structured this as something like after

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.500 
structured this as something like after
analyzing<00:04:53.550> both<00:04:54.550> points<00:04:54.940> of<00:04:55.030> view<00:04:55.090> it's

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
analyzing both points of view it's

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.750 
analyzing both points of view it's
obvious<00:04:55.960> that<00:04:55.990> point<00:04:56.500> of<00:04:56.590> view<00:04:56.710> number<00:04:56.980> two<00:04:57.370> is

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
obvious that point of view number two is

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.150 
obvious that point of view number two is
stronger<00:04:58.120> or<00:04:58.330> it's<00:04:58.600> obvious<00:04:58.900> that<00:04:59.160> McDonald's

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
stronger or it's obvious that McDonald's

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.770 
stronger or it's obvious that McDonald's
is<00:05:01.200> not<00:05:02.200> an<00:05:02.380> impressive<00:05:02.680> restaurant<00:05:03.550> or

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
is not an impressive restaurant or

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.470 
is not an impressive restaurant or
however<00:05:04.780> we<00:05:04.990> want<00:05:05.290> to<00:05:05.410> word<00:05:05.560> it<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.360> then<00:05:07.360> the

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
however we want to word it and then the

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.620 
however we want to word it and then the
last<00:05:07.690> sentence<00:05:08.170> is<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.410> prediction<00:05:09.030> or<00:05:10.030> a

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
last sentence is a prediction or a

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.520 
last sentence is a prediction or a
recommendation<00:05:13.110> so<00:05:14.110> taking<00:05:14.440> our

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
recommendation so taking our

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.570 
recommendation so taking our
hypothetical<00:05:14.830> essay<00:05:15.720> about<00:05:16.720> McDonald's<00:05:17.320> and

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
hypothetical essay about McDonald's and

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.520 
hypothetical essay about McDonald's and
if<00:05:18.580> we<00:05:18.730> agree<00:05:19.210> more<00:05:19.450> so<00:05:19.690> with<00:05:19.990> point<00:05:20.320> of<00:05:20.410> view

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
if we agree more so with point of view

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.320 
if we agree more so with point of view
number<00:05:20.740> two<00:05:20.920> the<00:05:21.130> McDonald's<00:05:21.610> is<00:05:21.700> not<00:05:21.880> a<00:05:21.910> great

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
number two the McDonald's is not a great

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.800 
number two the McDonald's is not a great
restaurant<00:05:22.810> and<00:05:22.990> we<00:05:23.650> can<00:05:23.830> say<00:05:24.630> it<00:05:25.630> is

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
restaurant and we can say it is

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.640 
restaurant and we can say it is
recommended<00:05:26.640> for<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:28.810> above<00:05:28.990> reasons<00:05:29.230> that

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
recommended for the above reasons that

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.440 
recommended for the above reasons that
that<00:05:34.620> attending<00:05:35.670> McDonald's<00:05:36.670> is<00:05:36.880> not<00:05:37.240> an

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
that attending McDonald's is not an

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.900 
that attending McDonald's is not an
intelligent<00:05:37.960> idea<00:05:38.200> I'm<00:05:38.950> not<00:05:39.100> sure<00:05:39.280> we'd<00:05:39.760> say

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
intelligent idea I'm not sure we'd say

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.160 
intelligent idea I'm not sure we'd say
something<00:05:40.270> like<00:05:40.450> that<00:05:40.630> I'm<00:05:40.720> kind<00:05:40.900> of<00:05:40.930> pulling

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
something like that I'm kind of pulling

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.490 
something like that I'm kind of pulling
that<00:05:41.320> off<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.590> top<00:05:41.800> of<00:05:41.830> my<00:05:41.890> head<00:05:43.350> okay
