00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.700
 new technology spares her video 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.280
 it is time the front camera from 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.210
 to test new one plus one smartphone 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.460
 and no 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.590
 with your monitor tv or tablet 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.780
 smartphone no matter where you have this video 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.220
 everything is in order 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.240
 the quality of the front camera or the 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.439
 Video recording really seems that way 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.910
 to be bad 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.740
 I do not make any secret of it now 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.650
 i'm just turning this video on 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.970
 third times the first two times I 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.590
 I've got it on 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 computer I looked at did it to me on the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.940
 jahnplatz display looks at the quality 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.190
 really seems to be so bad and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.010
 not only from the camera but 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.570
 synonymous of the audio recording there have 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 We now apparently really is one 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.800
 Weakness found in one plus one where 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.000
 yes the rest then but the latte pretty 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.460
 high and hangs in the video recording yes 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.949
 many say now i wish mine 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.910
 smartphone with the front camera would like that 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.120
 record well 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.219
 yes but in relation to the rest of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.660
 I find this device here now 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.460
 just a bit mau 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.860
 even if you go high with the others 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.930
 compare end android devices from it 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.110
 we would bring a bit more 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.820
 movement 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.850
 hahaha I think an iphone 4 1 before 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.430
 A perfect place gets this way and now 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.259
 something bright that I go to them again 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.110
 or what I would be when bursting is the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.549
 apparently the brightness control 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.380
 So solid is the adaptation 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.030
 I like it there is nothing jerky that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.460
 at least it seems so is 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.549
 even that works and now 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.740
 a few more moves rhine and the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.270
 but worked just on the recording the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.479
 I have already looked at it 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.759
 okay I will this video 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.590
 of course in an obi reinhauen that 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.360
 the beginning cut away the end 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.460
 cut away and then back technology 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.409
 sloth 1 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.900
 but otherwise I will at the quality 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.070
 Again, nothing changes 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.869
 audio recording quality remains again 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.180
 so that you can compare it 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.950
 and yes, even if many chickens scream 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.990
 yes but on youtube you can do that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.080
 not compare but for me it is 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.880
 just come again like most 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.540
 probably her straight with the front 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.340
 facing camera taken videos 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.440
 distribute friends send themselves 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.980
 save somewhere or upload yourself 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.010
 like this 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.230
 there is of course compressed and there me 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.940
 that makes every device so I think 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.380
 there you can compare that too yes 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.860
 even if you say of course again 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.360
 could 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.950
 the one manufacturer controls that 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.540
 youtube.com pressing better than that 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.430
 Another one would have to like a million 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.010
 otherwise, I do not care 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.860
 now enough talked that such easy 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.050
 just that, I'll say 08 15 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.330
 Comparative video will be for the of 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.970
 facetime camera video quality at one 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.590
 plus one to watch makes it good and 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.590
 until the next video chat
