00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.279
 from monday school holidays go junos 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.649
 one would now like to think of most people 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.490
 Students would laze and have fun 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.200
 the program 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.059
 but many also do a vacation job 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.130
 to supplement her pocket money 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.750
 where can i find one last 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.580

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.770

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.840
 professional woman here in the studio is one 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.939
 at least for all holiday jobs the same 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.460
 It's about money, because I wish 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.699
 all have switches for later 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.619
 save so we can walk in the direction 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.170
 for my flat my free time too 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.610
 finance 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.320
 any purchase then 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.750
 outside the frame countries others 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.910
 could possibly be called and travel 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.480
 I have it on the last car of it 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.100
 bought the money divided for that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.149
 Everyday lives on and for 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.309
 special purchases new mobile phone from 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.530
 splashing in the morning and in the evening 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.510
 Crush the belly with ice and 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.340
 just enjoy the sun 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.809
 works with such wishes at 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.330
 Therefore, many young people in the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.460
 Do not spend holidays instead 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.619
 your holidays with your pocket money 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.810
 to supplement job sup- plements, for example 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.670
 in the supermarket on the one hand 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.049
 We have one for our jobs 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.280
 cash in on the holidays 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.900
 be replaced 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.820
 on the other side we offer them 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.400
 also in the market for the shipment of the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.900
 Guarantee goods even during vacation periods 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.740
 to be able to 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.840
 however, these are not usually 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.640
 more the vacation jobs before ten 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.990
 There were still students back then 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.909
 two or three weeks in the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.439
 summer holidays somewhere with tackled around 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.189
 For example, the driver's license 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.500
 finance 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.329
 today the adolescents mostly work 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.310
 more regular throughout the year 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.320
 distributed in a job and most 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.090
 Aids are already over 18 years 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.380
 old 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.070
 through the opening hours until 22 o'clock 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.649
 We are allowed to over these hours only 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.579
 Use 18-year-old 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.899
 otherwise you have to go home 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.509
 we also send and allow ourselves 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.210
 mobility generally only temporary job 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.759
 18 year old to forgive the talk 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.409
 until 10 o'clock could use for under 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.270
 18-year-old is then after the 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.979
 youth employment regulations none 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.840
 Shopping cart tidying up more allowed 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.080
 but enjoy the evening and the sun 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.080
 hip, trendy, popular 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.440
 vera Schroeder is now with us 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.030
 Adolescent of the city of Aachen woman 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.370
 Schroeder the students we just 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.030
 All have seen all relatively old over 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.099
 18 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.790
 is there the classic student 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.080
 Vacation job for younger still 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.870
 are definitely last years 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.799
 become less 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:41.709
 maybe jobs in factories are possible 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:42.579
 in cafes in restaurants maybe too 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.180
 in stores yet 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.739
 I think that is so great that the 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.590
 area he receives what is it on her 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.329
 view after the declined on 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.670
 Jugendschutz on the one hand so 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.850
 they can only until 20 o'clock 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.470
 those under 18 are used 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.060
 or 15 to 18 year olds and mostly 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.230
 I think it's less about vacation jobs 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.700
 as to a continuous 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.470
 We also have employment 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.760
 Seen as a grid separates temporal 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.079
 Restrictions exist for younger people 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.139
 teenagers which others 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.209
 there are restrictions there at the 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:20.560
 Vacation jobs so 15 to 18 years old 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.660
 teenagers the time limit 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.269
 between 6 and 20 o'clock on one 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.609
 side and on the other side stop 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:32.500
 not more than 40 hours a week 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:35.200
 and Saturdays and Sundays are mostly 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.989
 excluded and not more than 20 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.549
 days a year , the specifications are explained 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.200
 one such a vacation job best per 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.769
 contract or is an oral one 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.540
 agreement the bgb says an oral 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.760
 agreement is also a contract but to 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.120
 Safety of all , I always became one 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.980
 written contract advice for the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.530
 employer so he really knows how to 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.900
 who you are dealing with so that he knows that 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.600
 also the parents 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.460
 agree and also by 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.370
 sides of the parents or parental 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.110
 custodians and adolescents 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.720
 files is coming to any accidents 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.080
 For example, it should be very clear 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.340
 is where the service provider is to be found 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.600
 that means the students are then too 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.420
 insured if there is a contract 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.680
 exactly where can you find now at short notice 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.340
 Another vacation job you are pretty late 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.110
 already it is very late most likely 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.880
 if really over then 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.740
 vitamin b or by 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.810
 becomes self-initiative and introduces itself 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.060
 in cafés or wherever 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.530
 because the employment agencies do that 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.090
 not anymore the employment agency makes us 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.980
 not only at the places did not work either 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.050
