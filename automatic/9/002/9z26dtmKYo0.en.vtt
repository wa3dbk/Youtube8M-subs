00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700
 dear, you say how much Ukraine 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:13.130
 began to exist as a country as a country 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.130
 from such a territory it remains to exist 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:24.869
 9 12 years nine minutes maybe less here 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:29.820
 because surely what is today 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.780
 going on in romania and parliamentary 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 batches of romania are available and program 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.899
 the return of the Bessarabian party of power that is 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.820
 rude 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.260
 there is not one in parliament 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.690
 party program that has not been 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.789
 recorded in the Bessarabian countries this process 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.579
 will go of course there and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.030
 Vendra situation with her party there fucking 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.350
 for example which also have a program 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.520
 installation return 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.329
 bukoviny I want to note also that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.460
 imagine 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.589
 and now if the Russian parliament 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.659
 met parties in the program which was 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.560
 recorded the return of the edge of it for a long time 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.200
 scandal and then everything would be just to 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.869
 saliva has spread but in European countries with 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.900
 other side it is written down and nobody but 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.360
 you're not sending or not how about this 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.369
 going through well and most importantly ours 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.030
 a situation that will necessarily 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:32.930
 Crimea will explode here is the most important 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.900
 disruptive element in our south 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.079
 I want to say that there was not a single edge 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.299
 war in history 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:46.740
 Crimea for centuries belonged to different 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.520
 States several centuries came running 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.659
 Turkey and the last Russian 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.720
 the empire took away the Crimea then gave it 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.090
 handed the hook presented as 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.810
 it doesn't matter how Ukraine does not remember Ukraine 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 no lessons 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.170
 because at the head of Ukraine last 20 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.700
 years were political pygmy well here 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.860
 sort of ideological leader 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.490
 make cardboard and fingers and other 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:24.740
 Yushchenko here's a red director for not 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:28.220
 happened here wait surely not and not 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:32.959
 there will be another few years left 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.080
 before the model from turkish peasant 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.340
 Turkish Crimean Tatar she Turkish 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.140
 here can collect 20 percent of signatures 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.630
 the resident population is then turned on 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.070
 all European nation mechanisms have 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.110
 right to self-determination 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:53.570
 we agreed with it here definitely 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.900
 will be so will be created 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.540
 Crimean Tatar autonomy as another 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.310
 state with a different cultural code with 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.350
 orienting others 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.320
 with other landmarks with another 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.390
 vector directionality which will be 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.110
 very cleverly sponsored above all 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.300
 turkey because all residents 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:19.330
 Crimean Tatar is in Istanbul and 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:23.870
 from 19 to 22 year 2019 second year we 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:30.470
 Ukraine will lose the Crimea and you lose it 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:35.540
 will be right because god did 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:38.600
 so Ukraine got not scored 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.049
 independence for which there was no spilled 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.660
 of blood 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.650
 ninety first year in the name of mind as well 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.170
 same largest state in europe and 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.910
 we and instead of understanding what it is 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.180
 was the only time in history 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.090
 which will never happen again we 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.430
 started 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.849
 with the fact that they began to destroy everything 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.250
 thanks to what it was mined 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:05.160
 so pineapples will pull with 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.280
 state of affairs that is today if 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.360
 would i tell you the ninety first year 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:15.030
 what will be 2011 what all that will be profit 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.380
 will bring the same 50 families that do not 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.880
 there will be no democracy 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.190
 but all parties will be invisible 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.720
 democratic slogans but all the rest 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.290
 bullshit that we see around 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.720
 would you be any man revered for an idiot 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.169
 that can not be so remember our 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.710
 ideas 91 years we are 11 10 economics in the world 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.139
 we do not consider 3 economy in europe 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.700
 uk germany france ukraine 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.040
 economy on planes missiles grain and 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.750
 meat 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.060
 the account is funny now is even funny 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.370
 think about it like this this is all 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.150
 continues here nothing stopped 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.630
 nothing disappeared on the ground queue 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.760
 sale of land 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.340
 Well, ios internal contradictions 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:10.490
 are growing 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:12.650
 because what to do to thousands of Lviv 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.229
 unemployed young people 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.960
 what do they do but they sit there sunflower seeds 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:22.680
 they eat there for a year 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.220
 work no prospects no nothing 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.940
 no implementation no no actualization 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.400
 there is no and is not foreseen in principle 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.690
 nothing but you can try to become 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:41.520
 seller tent or waiter 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:43.320
 possible if you take this why not 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.150
 go roll up from banners with 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.789
 pleasure well, so do not forget that 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.400
 exactly everything is from that side or 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.940
 let's say from this side 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:57.300
 here and in the south of these many 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.940
 Odessa there is a whole story and traditions 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.560
 revolutionary still alive here it is possible 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.130
 see by those guys who are there him 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.860
 visas 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.889
 so we have a lot of what's in front of which 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.460
 interesting I think this decade is not 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.800
 everything will be boring and now Vladimir just 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.780
 You write an optimist, I think that after 4 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.150
 of the year Ukraine will begin the loss of territories 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.160
 Uzhgorod have arms and legs and Slovakia 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.169
 he also writes Crimea in the banyat section 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.100
 Russia and Turkey are not already preparing an act 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:25.100
 inland black sea 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.260
 Yes, I think there will be a conflict because 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:36.030
 what if in the Crimea seriously? 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:41.220
 then when it will be the edge will surely be 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:45.960
 conflicts happen and it is not clear who 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:51.060
 Ukrainians will not protect the Crimea 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:53.720
 protect the Crimea because then it 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.880
 contrary to the European choice of Ukraine 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.639
 because the Crimea will be selected strictly 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.130
 how how did not fade away and share how everyone 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:02.760
 strictly by standards and by standards there is 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.800
 population 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.320
 she requires autonomy he needs to give out 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.450
 it's an institute number and so on here 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:15.090
 and there are people who say so 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.919
 has some drive and will 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.960
 against this stands out of course their 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:22.349
 Russia will certainly support because 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.240
 as Russia fought so much shut 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:30.599
 handed it to the brotherly people then 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:33.440
 brotherly here am they took it and about whether 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:33.440
 here
