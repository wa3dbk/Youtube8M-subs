and<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.309> got<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.910> idea<00:00:39.239> originally<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.559> Def

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and I got this idea originally from Def

and I got this idea originally from Def
and<00:00:41.160> young<00:00:41.309> check<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:42.239> his<00:00:42.390> video<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.840> here

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and young check out his video up here

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.270 
and young check out his video up here
and<00:00:44.360> what<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.079> again<00:00:46.829> based<00:00:47.100> off

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
and what it is is it's a again based off

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.369 
and what it is is it's a again based off
of<00:00:47.329> Merlin<00:00:48.329> camera<00:00:49.200> stabilizer<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:51.350> it's<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
of Merlin camera stabilizer and it's a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.380 
of Merlin camera stabilizer and it's a
lot<00:00:52.530> cheaper<00:00:52.559> than<00:00:53.250> buying<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.699> actual<00:00:54.149> thing

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.590 
that you see right here for about 40
bucks<00:01:02.609> now<00:01:03.600> mind<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:06.180> price<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.540> I

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.420 
bucks now mind you the price that I
built<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.200> subjective<00:01:07.799> meaning<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
built this is subjective meaning that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.080 
built this is subjective meaning that
the<00:01:09.380> things<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.530> need<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
vary so it may cost about 40 bucks may

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.460 
vary so it may cost about 40 bucks may
cost<00:01:19.680> less<00:01:19.860> may<00:01:20.790> cost<00:01:21.090> above<00:01:21.600> 40<00:01:21.990> bucks<00:01:22.170> but

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.039 
cost less may cost above 40 bucks but
it's<00:01:23.159> held<00:01:23.610> cheaper<00:01:24.270> than<00:01:24.479> getting<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
it's held cheaper than getting the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.690 
it's held cheaper than getting the
Merlin<00:01:25.619> camera<00:01:26.100> stabilizer<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.920> again<00:01:29.189> got

and a macro slider

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.810 
and a macro slider
raiga<00:04:39.699> and<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:41.139> was<00:04:41.229> pretty<00:04:41.380> cool<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.800> what<00:04:42.759> he

raiga and it was pretty cool and what he
says<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.240> balancing<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:45.039> floater<00:04:45.850> is

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
says is that balancing the floater is

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.710 
says is that balancing the floater is
really<00:04:47.830> difficult<00:04:48.039> and<00:04:48.430> truthfully<00:04:49.389> it<00:04:49.570> is

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
really difficult and truthfully it is

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.020 
really difficult and truthfully it is
difficult<00:04:50.169> because<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:51.190> have<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.490> give<00:04:51.910> it

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
difficult because you have to give it

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.420 
difficult because you have to give it
some<00:04:52.240> thought<00:04:52.479> you<00:04:52.690> have<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:53.110> put<00:04:53.919> time<00:04:54.160> and

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
some thought you have to put time and

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.800 
some thought you have to put time and
effort<00:04:54.699> and<00:04:54.820> balancing<00:04:55.330> this<00:04:55.449> piece<00:04:55.630> if<00:04:55.780> you

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
effort and balancing this piece if you

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.629 
effort and balancing this piece if you
don't<00:04:55.990> balance<00:04:56.199> it<00:04:56.759> it's<00:04:57.759> not<00:04:58.389> going<00:04:58.840> it's<00:04:59.229> the

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
don't balance it it's not going it's the

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.939 
don't balance it it's not going it's the
whole<00:05:00.639> system's<00:05:01.030> gonna<00:05:01.180> go<00:05:01.530> topsy-turvy<00:05:02.530> on
