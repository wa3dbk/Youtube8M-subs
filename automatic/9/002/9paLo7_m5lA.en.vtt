glued<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> front<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.050> camera<00:00:37.640> when

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
glued to the front of the camera when

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.270 
glued to the front of the camera when
you<00:00:38.760> don't<00:00:38.940> need<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.600> pretty

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
you don't need it it's pretty

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.709 
you don't need it it's pretty
unobtrusive<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.059> use<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.390> camera

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
unobtrusive and you can use the camera

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.110 
unobtrusive and you can use the camera
every<00:00:43.260> normal<00:00:43.500> way<00:00:43.829> possible<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.579> that's<00:00:44.940> why

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
every normal way possible so that's why

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.510 
every normal way possible so that's why
I<00:00:45.149> decided<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.020> hot<00:00:46.260> glue<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.489> I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
I decided to just hot glue it on so I

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
I decided to just hot glue it on so I
don't<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.820> worry<00:00:48.090> about<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.390> these<00:00:49.020> are

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
don't have to worry about it these are

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.170 
don't have to worry about it these are
the<00:00:49.350> ring<00:00:49.530> lights<00:00:49.770> they're<00:00:50.070> very<00:00:50.399> common<00:00:51.030> you

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the ring lights they're very common you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.479 
the ring lights they're very common you
can<00:00:51.360> find<00:00:51.629> them<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.899> any<00:00:52.050> place<00:00:52.489> sometimes

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
can find them in any place sometimes

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.189 
can find them in any place sometimes
even<00:00:53.760> dollar<00:00:54.000> stores<00:00:54.390> they're<00:00:54.629> very<00:00:54.870> cheap

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
even dollar stores they're very cheap

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.310 
even dollar stores they're very cheap
they<00:00:55.829> hook<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.520> USB<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.210> therefore<00:00:58.199> they

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
they hook up into USB and therefore they

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.139 
they hook up into USB and therefore they
run<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.649> five<00:00:58.890> volts<00:00:59.280> all<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.030> is

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
run on five volts all you have to do is

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.070 
run on five volts all you have to do is
dismantle<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> pull<00:01:02.070> out<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.840> PCB<00:01:03.840> with

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
any wires or any connections so there it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.219 
any wires or any connections so there it
is<00:01:22.860> sort<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.759> mated<00:01:24.180> together<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.049> see

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
is sort of mated together you can see

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.350 
is sort of mated together you can see
you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.409> even<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.979> your<00:01:26.310> phone<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you can even have your phone on at the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.230 
you can even have your phone on at the
same<00:01:27.570> time<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.350> ring<00:01:28.530> light<00:01:28.970> they<00:01:29.970> just

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
same time as that ring light they just

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.140 
same time as that ring light they just
pull<00:01:30.450> juice<00:01:30.750> from<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> same<00:01:31.439> battery<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.820> here

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
pull juice from the same battery so here

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.620 
pull juice from the same battery so here
is<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> test<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.530> macro<00:01:35.220> features<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.880> you

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
is a test of the macro features as you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.929 
is a test of the macro features as you
can<00:01:36.810> see<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.200> focusing<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> penny<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.400> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
can see I'm focusing on a penny if you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.520 
can see I'm focusing on a penny if you
get<00:01:39.090> too<00:01:39.270> close<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.840> penny<00:01:40.049> there's<00:01:40.439> a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
get too close to the penny there's a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.560 
get too close to the penny there's a
small<00:01:40.890> dark<00:01:41.189> shadow<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.939> appears<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
small dark shadow that appears in the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.899 
small dark shadow that appears in the
middle<00:01:42.810> that's<00:01:43.049> because<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.829> actual<00:01:44.250> lens<00:01:44.460> on

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
middle that's because the actual lens on

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.560 
middle that's because the actual lens on
the<00:01:44.970> camera<00:01:45.890> starts<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.130> interfere<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the camera starts to interfere with the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.350 
the camera starts to interfere with the
lights<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.110> there's<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.380> cone<00:01:50.030> where<00:01:51.030> you

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
lights so there's a cone where you

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
lights so there's a cone where you
actually<00:01:51.509> can't<00:01:52.020> get<00:01:52.259> too<00:01:52.439> close<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:53.250> that's

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
actually can't get too close but that's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.399 
actually can't get too close but that's
fine<00:01:53.640> because<00:01:53.700> anyway<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> macro<00:01:54.930> feature<00:01:55.170> on

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
fine because anyway the macro feature on

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.899 
fine because anyway the macro feature on
this<00:01:55.590> camera<00:01:55.829> lines<00:01:56.189> up<00:01:56.399> perfectly<00:01:56.790> with

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
this camera lines up perfectly with

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.139 
this camera lines up perfectly with
where<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.540> distance<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.110> LED<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:59.149> there

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
where the distance of the LED is there

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.660 
where the distance of the LED is there
is<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> picture<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> penny<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.490> can

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
is a picture of the penny and as you can

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.459 
is a picture of the penny and as you can
see<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> pretty<00:02:03.659> reasonable

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
see you can get a pretty reasonable

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.180 
see you can get a pretty reasonable
close-up<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:06.530> depending<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.770> camera<00:02:08.160> you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
close-up and depending on the camera you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.619 
close-up and depending on the camera you
choose<00:02:08.550> some<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> little<00:02:09.300> bit<00:02:09.479> better

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
choose some have a little bit better

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.190 
choose some have a little bit better
resolution

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200

was using and just another close-up you

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.990 
was using and just another close-up you
can<00:03:31.299> even<00:03:31.419> see<00:03:31.859> on<00:03:32.859> the<00:03:33.040> picture<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:33.579> can<00:03:33.790> get

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
see how close you can get you can even

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.300 
see how close you can get you can even

see fibers from that paper that I have

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.839 
see fibers from that paper that I have
to<00:03:42.639> switch<00:03:42.879> sitting<00:03:43.239> on<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:45.160> there's<00:03:45.370> just<00:03:45.669> a

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
to switch sitting on so there's just a

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.860 
to switch sitting on so there's just a
the<00:03:46.629> close-up<00:03:47.079> as<00:03:47.349> you<00:03:47.859> can<00:03:48.040> see<00:03:48.480> now<00:03:49.480> i<00:03:49.510> have<00:03:49.840> a

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
the close-up as you can see now i have a

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.659 
the close-up as you can see now i have a
few<00:03:50.169> other<00:03:50.349> examples<00:03:50.709> i'll<00:03:51.280> show<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.489> at<00:03:51.639> the

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
few other examples i'll show you at the

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.699 
few other examples i'll show you at the

end of the video of some macro
photography<00:03:53.859> that<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:54.519> took<00:03:54.609> with<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:55.120> setup

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
photography that I took with this setup

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.670 
photography that I took with this setup
but<00:03:56.769> again<00:03:57.400> it's<00:03:57.819> a<00:03:58.120> very<00:03:58.389> simple<00:03:58.720> hack<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.500> put

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
but again it's a very simple hack to put

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.039 
but again it's a very simple hack to put
together<00:03:59.980> if<00:04:00.190> you<00:04:00.310> have<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.609> parts<00:04:00.879> in<00:04:01.720> fact

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
together if you have the parts in fact

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.949 
together if you have the parts in fact
any<00:04:02.730> because<00:04:03.730> blackberries<00:04:04.449> have<00:04:04.629> removable

any because blackberries have removable

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.930 
any because blackberries have removable
batteries<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.889> can<00:04:05.919> use<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> number<00:04:06.819> of

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
batteries you can use a number of

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.020 
batteries you can use a number of
different<00:04:07.030> phones<00:04:07.629> all<00:04:08.530> of<00:04:08.829> which<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.849> can

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
different phones all of which you can

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.610 
different phones all of which you can
just<00:04:10.209> hot<00:04:10.419> glue<00:04:10.449> the<00:04:10.810> battery<00:04:11.139> on<00:04:11.169> they<00:04:11.440> run

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
just hot glue the battery on they run

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.559 
just hot glue the battery on they run
three<00:04:11.919> point<00:04:12.159> seven<00:04:12.340> volts<00:04:12.699> even<00:04:13.299> though<00:04:13.419> the

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
three point seven volts even though the

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.129 
three point seven volts even though the
LEDs<00:04:14.400> should<00:04:15.400> take<00:04:15.579> five<00:04:15.849> volts<00:04:16.239> there's<00:04:16.930> no

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
LEDs should take five volts there's no

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.979 
LEDs should take five volts there's no
harm<00:04:17.409> running<00:04:17.739> about<00:04:17.919> 3.7<00:04:18.760> in<00:04:18.849> fact<00:04:19.090> running

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
harm running about 3.7 in fact running

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.509 
harm running about 3.7 in fact running
them<00:04:20.109> at<00:04:20.260> five<00:04:20.469> I<00:04:20.500> found<00:04:20.919> them<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.219> be<00:04:21.250> too

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
them at five I found them to be too

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.900 
them at five I found them to be too
bright<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:22.599> 3.7<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.680> just<00:04:23.950> fine

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
bright so 3.7 is just fine

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.960 
bright so 3.7 is just fine
so<00:04:25.090> here's<00:04:25.300> an<00:04:25.450> example<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:27.190> micro<00:04:27.580> SD

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
so here's an example of the micro SD

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.230 
so here's an example of the micro SD
cards<00:04:28.480> being<00:04:29.050> taken<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.800> photo<00:04:30.460> taken<00:04:30.850> of<00:04:31.090> it

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
cards being taken a photo taken of it

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.220 
cards being taken a photo taken of it
that's<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:32.310> sim<00:04:33.310> card<00:04:33.580> slot<00:04:33.880> just<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.810> couple<00:04:35.020> of

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
that's a sim card slot just a couple of

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.810 
that's a sim card slot just a couple of
pins<00:04:35.500> on<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:37.300> PCB<00:04:38.200> board<00:04:38.590> again<00:04:39.580> some

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.670 
pins on a PCB board again some
microchips<00:04:40.180> now<00:04:40.570> it's<00:04:40.810> hard<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.290> tell<00:04:41.560> the

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
microchips now it's hard to tell the

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.710 
microchips now it's hard to tell the
scale<00:04:41.980> these<00:04:42.220> are<00:04:42.370> extremely<00:04:42.880> tiny<00:04:43.270> but<00:04:43.600> if

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
scale these are extremely tiny but if

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.960 
scale these are extremely tiny but if
you're<00:04:43.870> not<00:04:43.930> familiar<00:04:44.140> with<00:04:44.620> with<00:04:45.370> chips<00:04:45.700> it

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
you're not familiar with with chips it

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.150 
you're not familiar with with chips it
might<00:04:46.180> be<00:04:46.330> hard<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.780> tell<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.620> instead<00:04:47.980> I<00:04:48.040> took

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
might be hard to tell so instead I took

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.490 
might be hard to tell so instead I took
a<00:04:48.340> picture<00:04:48.580> of<00:04:48.730> my<00:04:48.940> hand<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.540> you<00:04:50.110> can<00:04:50.290> see

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
a picture of my hand and you can see

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.730 
a picture of my hand and you can see
here<00:04:50.770> I'm<00:04:50.920> zooming<00:04:51.310> in<00:04:51.520> on<00:04:52.020> some<00:04:53.020> hair

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
here I'm zooming in on some hair

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.880 
here I'm zooming in on some hair
follicles<00:04:54.400> on<00:04:54.640> my<00:04:54.910> knuckle<00:04:55.740> thank<00:04:56.740> you<00:04:56.860> very
