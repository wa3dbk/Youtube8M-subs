00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:09.520
 Yes hi jajan laf 4 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:13.450
 It is alpha 7 r which has appeared several times from this time, but it is also 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:17.289
 This is a mount adapter 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.240
 It is intended that the return to the e mount a mount 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.199
 You can see Translucent Mirror 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:30.320
 I have put in this to hit a mount 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:32.270
 It is not that I can do it, but this 7080 mm grandmother of this Tamron 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.700
 Properly 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.360
 You can use autofocus properly You can use autofocus but there is also a problem 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.530
 The 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:48.520
 e Shake correction in the mount lens a Shake in the mount modi 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:54.670
 In other words , do not throw away after image stabilization 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.500
 Difficult to it nowadays still shooting because well there is no terrible state is I shake correction 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.170
 is not it 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:04.489
 I can not decide this way at all 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:09.159
 I wonder what the head of a dove is confusing or the kingfisher is confusing 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:13.899
 I'm not really good い I'm true now 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:18.789
 Come on here is a 20mm f 1.8 lens between the city, but also 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:20.240
 Well in the place where originally a lens that I do not think that compatibility with the mount is already so good 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:26.110
 Even though I 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:32.500
 But Eiji I'd thought I Na or reasonably available in listening 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:37.210
 It's breath after all fine but this is also Bookshelf This wide-angle lens 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:40.190
 It's a blazer and about can be seen visibly 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.200
 Yes Well look how do 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.100
 'S not about not think wearing eye mount adapter probably this no discomfort seen 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.320
 Is it 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:59.159
 By the way, it is a standard zoom lens of 70 mm that is important to Carl . 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.310
 After all there are only sony women and it 's nice to meet you well af is also quick and quiet 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.790
 The 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:11.590
 After all it is not this fur 7 r which is different if we just use this lens 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.250
 You can use the a 1 and body here, but you can use Alpha 99 or something 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.900
 right 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.720
 But here's how it is without camera shake correction 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.350
 But it I will be Willing to came off perfectly 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:29.260
 In Now because I'm much trouble you can use the same lens 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:33.760
 Alpha 99 flagship aircraft so far there are the most flagship aircraft and 7 Alba 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:38.230
 I tried this, but what about the difference in image quality? 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.710
 Alpha 99 is 24 people pixels by the way 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.410
 There is a low-pass filter 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:50.360
 It's no low-pass filter as you know is not Shi ability is sounds good 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.450
 The reason is because it is 16 mega pixels and the number of pixels is more here 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:59.700
 There is a difference that there is no low pass filter, but also 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:05.340
 Taking pictures by alternately replacing Carl Zeiss 2470mm zoom lens of a child 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.930
 Not Kawan at all is a glance Orimashi taken by Was Well almost about the same conditions try to 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.360
 I feel but I 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:16.640
 That it is Comparing come reflected in this vividly 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:22.430
 After all it is as for the person of alpha 7 r it is crispy 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:27.800
 If you compare amp 99, it's probably out of focus 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:31.350
 I do not strictly go up the comparison test of the equipment, but I just do somehow 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.250
 I just shot it while doing two cars side by side 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.510
 But 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:41.100
 Well I try to if I did not think a different up here 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.100
 I think in the future
