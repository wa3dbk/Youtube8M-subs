00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.550
 Today I am going to teach you how to do 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.090
 the rope braid 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.880
 known in English as rose price but 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.009
 I prefer to tell you pure braid I do not know 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.630
 why see how she likes women of 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:32.640
 name so it's very simple to do and 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.830
 to begin they are going to need to have their 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.440
 I untangled the way 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.829
 brush with this news 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.829
 well I'm going to do it by showing a side 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.719
 because I think it's easier but what 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.610
 fun of this braid is that you can 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.060
 occupy as a variant for different 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.120
 hairstyles 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.079
 and it's super pretty and it's very easy like that 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.490
 let's start 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:04.900
 We divide the hair into 2 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.900
 let's roll this bitumen out 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.050
 what we have here also so that the 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.180
 Same side 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.600
 A) Yes 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.550
 already as they see although they are towards the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.630
 sense of my face 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.280
 the ideal has just had high control with 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.030
 the fingers because one understands how 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.850
 get tangled up a little 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.880
 but it's not hard to follow then 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.430
 we roll up a bit like to have the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.550
 base list 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.310
 and so that this does not disarm us this 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.510
 lesson that we have ahead we had 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.510
 backward 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.550
 and this is where you have to hold with 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.500
 very careful 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.170
 and we continue in project in the same 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.980
 felt like we started 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.020
 we roll up 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:03.340
 roll up and roll up on itself 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.340
 we roll up and roll up 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.440
 and we repeat the procedure and so on 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.540
 finalize there are people who do not know 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.310
 sleep with this the next day they 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.940
 there are some waves a few drops 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.160
 nice but I is not us as ugly 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.010
 I like it I prefer the waves that are left 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.960
 when I sleep with braids of three 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.020
 dimensions these as a reader said 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.640
 of the blog could be called force because 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.390
 they are only two metals 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.760
 and good as you can see, I'm finishing 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.930
 here the end costs a bit because this 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.879
 it's shorter and it's loose 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.879
 then they do not put in this 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.630
 the ideal is to make the drastic 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.570
 little ones that are almost invisible more 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.590
 that nothing for a matter of determination 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.420
 but I had this elastic on hand 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:06.220
 and as you see 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.220
 so the force was left or 30 strings 13 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.540
 Well I hope you liked everything 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.549
 all right 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.549
 see you in my next video
