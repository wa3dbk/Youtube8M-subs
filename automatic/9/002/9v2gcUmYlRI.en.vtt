experimental test is going to do it

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.960 
experimental test is going to do it
together<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.950> surface<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.730> wishes

together with the surface that it wishes

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.800 
together with the surface that it wishes
a<00:01:03.360> rather<00:01:03.690> contact<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.800> sandpaper<00:01:05.640> contact<00:01:06.180> and

with this we can determine the friction

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.820 
with this we can determine the friction

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
coefficient and we can know that where

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.730

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
welding backward grip onto the surface

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230 
welding backward grip onto the surface
or<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.520> experiment<00:01:17.940> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
or not so to do this experiment the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.900 
or not so to do this experiment the
first<00:01:18.450> thing<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.860> when<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.250> rabbit<00:01:20.580> starts<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
first thing is when the rabbit starts to

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.570 
first thing is when the rabbit starts to
slide<00:01:21.150> down<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.600> means<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.580> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
slide down that means that is the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.280 
slide down that means that is the
friction<00:01:24.270> coefficient<00:01:24.390> where<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.080> can

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
friction coefficient where you can

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.130 
friction coefficient where you can
calculate<00:01:25.890> through<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.640> trigonometric

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
calculate through the trigonometric

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:38.990 
calculate through the trigonometric
trigonometric<00:01:28.140> function<00:01:28.500> so

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.570 

it's<00:01:40.000> moving<00:01:40.360> so<00:01:40.600> this<00:01:41.470> angle<00:01:41.710> we<00:01:42.369> need<00:01:42.490> to

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
it's moving so this angle we need to

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.520 
it's moving so this angle we need to
calculate<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.420> distance<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:43.990> height<00:01:44.200> and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
calculate the distance and height and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.230 
calculate the distance and height and
from<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.070> combination<00:01:45.520> you<00:01:45.640> can<00:01:45.700> know<00:01:45.940> the

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
from the combination you can know the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.990 
from the combination you can know the
friction<00:01:46.960> coefficient<00:01:47.050> of<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:48.369> contact

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
friction coefficient of the contact

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.609 
friction coefficient of the contact
rubber<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.900> five<00:01:50.590> minutes<00:01:55.050> now<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.110> second<00:01:56.560> I

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
rubber and five minutes now the second I

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.190 
rubber and five minutes now the second I
trying<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.009> do<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:58.420> check<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.869> friction

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
trying to do is to check the friction

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.980 
trying to do is to check the friction
coefficient<00:01:59.350> between<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.369> rubber<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
coefficient between the rubber and the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.950 
coefficient between the rubber and the
sandpaper<00:02:02.470> attack<00:02:02.979> so<00:02:03.820> I'm<00:02:04.330> going<00:02:04.390> to<00:02:04.659> repeat

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
sandpaper attack so I'm going to repeat

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.990 
sandpaper attack so I'm going to repeat
the<00:02:05.110> same<00:02:05.290> procedure<00:02:05.800> that<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.130> will<00:02:06.430> move<00:02:06.759> to

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
the same procedure that I will move to

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.610 
the same procedure that I will move to
fly<00:02:07.210> with<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.630> see<00:02:07.840> at<00:02:07.960> what<00:02:08.140> angle<00:02:08.350> does<00:02:09.330> this

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
fly with and see at what angle does this

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:30.330 
fly with and see at what angle does this
so<00:02:11.620> Colorado<00:02:12.160> was<00:02:12.489> light<00:02:12.700> up<00:02:28.350> like<00:02:29.350> DC<00:02:30.190> power

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
so Colorado was light up like DC power

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.059 
so Colorado was light up like DC power

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
this week's are added on to this volume

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.480 
this week's are added on to this volume
chances<00:03:19.210> first<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.470> purpose<00:03:20.830> is<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.250> balance

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
chances first the purpose is to balance

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.300 
chances first the purpose is to balance
up<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:24.330> weights<00:03:25.330> which<00:03:26.140> is<00:03:26.380> more<00:03:26.830> heavier<00:03:27.190> at

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
up the weights which is more heavier at

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.310 
up the weights which is more heavier at
behind<00:03:27.670> where<00:03:27.880> they<00:03:28.030> have<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.320> so-called

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
behind where they have a so-called

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.790 
behind where they have a so-called
gearbox<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.160> stepper<00:03:31.060> motor<00:03:31.360> so<00:03:32.350> this<00:03:32.620> way

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
gearbox and a stepper motor so this way

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.290 
gearbox and a stepper motor so this way
it's<00:03:32.920> putting<00:03:33.190> in<00:03:33.400> front<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.910> balance<00:03:34.060> it

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
it's putting in front is to balance it

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.210 
it's putting in front is to balance it
up<00:03:34.450> so<00:03:34.870> when<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.290> trolley<00:03:35.620> traveled<00:03:36.010> up<00:03:36.100> you

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
up so when the trolley traveled up you

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.670 
up so when the trolley traveled up you
will<00:03:36.370> not<00:03:36.490> really<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:38.350> other<00:03:38.440> thing<00:03:38.530> is

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
will not really and the other thing is

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.380 
will not really and the other thing is
having<00:03:38.980> these<00:03:39.220> weights<00:03:39.460> on<00:03:39.670> top<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:40.060> because

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
having these weights on top is because

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.250 
having these weights on top is because
that<00:03:40.660> we<00:03:41.350> want<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.620> simulate<00:03:41.800> it<00:03:42.160> as<00:03:42.460> as<00:03:43.260> actual

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
that we want to simulate it as as actual

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.970
