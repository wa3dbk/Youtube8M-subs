00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.639
 126 on 5 zayd you on training from this 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.500
 cabinet almost every day 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.200
 send svetlana train 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.360
 Diesel locomotives love for the first time these devices and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.000
 buttons an unenlightened person can 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.050
 confused and do not understand this button 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.630
 speakerphone 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.150
 hoods per foot move shunting 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.460
 diesel locomotive be careful here 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.099
 the dotted line shows the movement of trains 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.500
 Svetlana says that the technique is old yet 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.500
 Soviet but very reliable 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.039
 Meanwhile, the locomotive is already dialing code 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.620
 go and how far stop then 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.200
 seem the same dispatch plan with 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.470
 machinists she always 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.470
 connections 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.230
 dad is near 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.750
 shunting diesel locomotive carrying cargo all 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.239
 from food to construction 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.190
 materials on certain bases and to 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.680
 everything came to the addressee on the locomotive 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.320
 Works locomotive crew car 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.610
 his assistant and compiler of trains 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.369
 who forms the compositions 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.409
 Today he manages the locomotive Dmitry 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.960
 while being trained as a machinist to become 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.940
 not so easy to learn for a long time 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.310
 time to work as an assistant internship 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.710
 and pass exams however practice 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.300
 Dmitry will soon come at the end even 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.300
 are that here 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.000
 quickly figure out where in what seconds 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.380
 to make a decision 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.360
 because the slightest somewhere 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.370
 confusion this may lead to 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.790
 serious after 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.450
 managing the most important thing about it 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.450
 directly locomotive brakes 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.390
 machinist designs 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.789
 must know arctic on the brakes 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.799
 must know perfectly here it goes 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.310
 auxiliary two passport motive a 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.310
 here 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.320
 get out more 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.280
 young trainee days when learning from 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.860
 an experienced colleague as an assistant 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.080
 machinist machinist with experience mikhail 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.510
 Georgievich his time he served in 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.379
 railway troops and now 30 years 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.410
 controls the locomotive to work 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.770
 not every machinist will go 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.870
 this 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.060
 have and 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.370
 how many people I knew knew 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.370
 people just disaccustomed left 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.850
 Well 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.510
 could not cope with these 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.510
 for 75 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.300
 knowing the system 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.640
 have night trips 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.569
 half night 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.110
 in the afternoon 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.490
 and you have to come to work rested 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.770
 neat 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.750
 because 12 hours 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.260
 complicated 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.260
 show me 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.210
 control 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.620
 now we are heading north park 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.750
 this special area is 20 minutes away 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.850
 from tiraspol namely the locomotive 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.260
 leaves your cargo such flights back 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.020
 make about five 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.820
 to unload or attach the train 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.700
 only the motive team must work 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.030
 quickly accurate and consistent role for everyone 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.520
 here 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.370
 responsible errors should not be 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.600
 breaks between stops 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.730
 railway workers joking for many years 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.890
 a lot of interesting work 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.440
 stories about the posts among the times we come 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.530
 reserves ethereal fact that's serve v8 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.200
 to the meeting goes cargo belt 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.780
 nose more durik themselves goes man 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.380
 white shirts with short sleeves 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.270
 and the signals we signal turns 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.430
 attention generally nothing chefs often back 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.590
 then turned looks already here now 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.900
 enjoyed 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.330
 He fell between the rails because Lozhkyn to 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.870
 so we stopped and look like 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:14.760
 she has a shirt for two years 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:19.370
 yes yes already in the car replaced their countries well 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.370
 cars 15 drove bureau so I will eat 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.590
 we run up to him what can you do 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.730
 and this is the most she turns the guys where 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.620
 there could be 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.880
 we want from such a happy occasion to 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.880
 Goltsa was born in a shirt 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.729
 and this is a house-building plant here 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.860
 diesel locomotive brought cargo led cement 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.020
 own cement and is in these 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.030
 large tanks say that in one 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.080
 such a tank fits as many as five 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.080
 wagons with cement 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.169
 such locomotive stops today will be 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.330
 more than once railroad workers 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.430
 they say that the biggest problem is 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.560
 intersection with the roads of drivers 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.509
 passenger car ignores signs 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.120
 relocation and violates the rules of the road 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:13.949
 movements thereby exposing all 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.949
 members of the movement of delivery 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.900
 the work of the locomotive brigade is heavy 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.639
 requires attention and care despite 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.280
 on the brunt of working everyday will 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.990
 held on the road men smile and 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.300
 happy to talk about their 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.139
 the railroad profession has already become 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.139
 part of their life
