 and what are you doing this 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.669
 estimated 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.300
 and inactivity 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.029
 developers and windows 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.960
 forget this is not one of the hard ideas 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.120
 work kutyin is a secret building with paths 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.630
 yeah waiting to pick out something 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.330
 then finally like the same day 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.410
 will cease to be enough 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.390
 I know one thing 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.770
 lope 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.890
 you can always turn on the imagination and 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.310
 come up with an interesting lesson 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.060
 For example 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.810
 both ap 3 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.730
 diameter 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.710
 it remains a real board 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.080
 games 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.770
 excellent for destruction with a bunch 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.540
 target destruction 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.730
 This is not dangerous 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.170
 not dangerous 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.190
 but not for the faint of heart 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.660
 by the way, too 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.010
 I have not forgotten 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.740
 I will be taken from you 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.960

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.280
 and if we are now the number of people d 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.859
 Doll 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.750
 need to keep working like that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.580

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.040
 fee in it 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.150
 was done 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.040
 nothing either 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.630
 postpone them for now 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.250
 maybe then come in handy 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.760
 friends we go 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.840
 towards adventure 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.870
 and the first book we throw 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.640
 in Russia will not always miss 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 forward 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.090

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.660
 Vladimir Andrienko 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.810

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:10.970
 of course talk 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.970
 it turned out that those 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:19.309
 every plane 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:22.309
 last championship I do not agree 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.599
 as stated in this task 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.569

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.569
 however like my friends 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.529
 P 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.529
 it seems he does not need my help 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:00.889
 it's good that I always have with me 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.889
 small pocket could not 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.839
 barr 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:23.080
 have kids 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.900
 besides the pleasure of Volodya and the bears and 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.359
 population aging 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.259
 such a deal I can 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.009
 given by her 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.359
 country 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.270
 there are no terrible catastrophes 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.270
 besides her 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.189
 itar tass 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.289
 visitors began to do 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.559
 25 of them did 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:19.689
 always chooses the hardest way customers 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.189
 you will not meet competitors 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.789
 and these decisions 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.279
 in the country 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.440
 work plan 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.759
 was afraid 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.990
 I think what was the result was 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.849
 position all prime tass 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.849
 it was fun and the third crash site 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.199
 2 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.199
 children are our right 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.990
 it caused 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.529
 Bulgarian garages baku apa 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.960
 all works 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.439
 read more 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.559
 then I'm with you 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.559
 they want to spend 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:12.649
 the bout will nevertheless become 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:13.819
 hold 5 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.139
 for this number 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.770
 I did not know that on the table is low so 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.089
 great 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:22.290
 and this is only one 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.870
 know how many there were 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.949
 one is more interesting than the other 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.139
 the main thing is that everything depends on sharpness 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.270
 imagination diversity not 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.419
 canceled as it were 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.120
 your imagination do not get bored 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.240
 and it is not by chance just for rallying
