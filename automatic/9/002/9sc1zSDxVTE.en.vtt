00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.479
 You can probably save time with such a hot Porsche 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:07.570
 think this is supposed to pack 400 things but that's even possible with you 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.090
 a road car really 400 no hate create exclusively the 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.089
 World record attempt in car magazine Highspeed by Meike NienkÃ¶tter 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.679
 Record year extreme 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.220
 faster than any formula 1 car 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.249
 Speeds that otherwise only reach vehicles with rocket propulsion 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.009
 incredible loads 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.009
 everything has to fit the second exactly 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.080
 He wants to be the first to never get there 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.080
 Craft was an engineering and brave account 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.350
 this is what should happen here 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.970
 the high-speed track in southern Italy's Nardo the big one 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.829
 huge steep curve over twelve kilometers long built for extreme 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.829
 Speeds I'm already excited 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.110
 because we're building the car for a year now 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.260
 And last another year if you know of course if it is now 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.780
 really works or not 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.250
 386 km / h is the old mark to beat 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.550
 we have confidence starts in the first 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.550
 he has only six hours available 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.530
 But on the contrary 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.860
 Make street damage 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.440
 Nevertheless, the Porsche achieved immediately surpassed 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.150
 170 things 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.550
 but suddenly the 9 11 EUR 400 slows down 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.370
 rolls to the pits 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.010
 Laurin Braun 71 ridden clarified 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.710
 Werder Bremen II left slight vibration that Mirko Urban or Bund maybe yes 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.050
 Massless is short of a bump 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.670
 by Philipp Hoffmann to justify said that has to go look at Goethe 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.600
 something is going on when it comes to fixing the mechanics differently 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.400
 feverishly to screws 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.940
 The high speed makes the car so extreme on the road 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.070
 pressed that the Porsche scrapes most road markings simply 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.120
 the whole project is in danger 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.430
 worried looks at years enchanted time is running out 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.870
 but then the problem seems resolved the record hunt can go on 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.740
 the journey duration makes it easy to approach 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.449
 The Porsche is still not quite as it should 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.499
 the floor panels continue to yield 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.429
 the world record moves into the distance 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.679
 in another attempt to fix the carbon subfloor 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.169
 happens to a mechanic a momentous mishap 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:24.249
 but ride duration it takes a surprisingly relaxed ears amplification Tabaluga 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.949
 Tank drilled tuned slip 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.479
 we did it right away 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.499
 luckily it was not the gasoline but just the water tank 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.840
 but slowly the team of 9ff is running out of time 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.900
 And to make matters worse, the researcher just now has the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.579
 Tanke 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.939
 The 843 hp high-speed bolide shoots up to 70 liters per hundred kilometers 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.979
 through the injectors a little more than 30 minutes now remain for one 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:49.429
 more 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:50.329
 record attempt 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.269
 then the team needs the route spaces Jan Factor makes serious and this time 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.029
 it works better the underbody keeps the water pipes due to over 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:00.609
 Porsche storms the guinness book of records 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.609
 but this time it does not work 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.449
 No 9 No No 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.449
 no customers 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:15.079
 Trust once again has to pit the engineer and see his very last one 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.349
 even two instead of four 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.949
 a corner for 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.709
 Consumers put everything on a map thats not the new records in the world 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.709
 Stand ways 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.379
 "Either it works in this last round 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.119
 or all the work was free 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.579
 because it the 1 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.859
 again the speedometer needle storms in direction 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.069
 Cobain 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.699
 Blake foul

 Hall 3 2 3 2 3 0 2 0 via St 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.459
 play fast 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.029
 the crew was going to drive 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:56.489
 Absolutely not even though I built a car for a year but was Wagner 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.759
 something very fast reversed in the circle so not exactly 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:03.709
 Year when we had only the small light blue rear wing on it 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.839
 There were also three 16 even hits 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:07.759
 that was not nice 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:10.160
 winner-bubbly dead for the record goal 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.610
 even if the magical 491 was not cracked the world record is one 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.080
 great success and with 388 things 911 11 is a place at the top of the 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.120
 Statistics for sure
