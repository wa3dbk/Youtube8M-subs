saying this speculation comes in because

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.690

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
actual evidence just their work now I'm

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.840 
actual evidence just their work now I'm
going<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> trust<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.310> they're<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.399 
going to trust that they're not going to
lie<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.509> still<00:01:48.780> would<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
lie but I still would take this with a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.679 
lie but I still would take this with a
grain<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.619> salt<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.430> safe<00:01:50.689> anyways

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
grain of salt just to be safe anyways

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.480 
grain of salt just to be safe anyways
here's<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.530> they<00:01:52.619> said<00:01:52.649> they're<00:01:53.189> saying

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
here's what they said they're saying

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.639 
here's what they said they're saying
that<00:01:53.729> dice<00:01:54.149> potentially<00:01:54.899> went<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.259> them<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that dice potentially went to them and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.249 
that dice potentially went to them and
asked<00:01:55.920> about<00:01:55.979> how<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.310> hell<00:01:56.689> hello<00:01:57.689> games<00:01:58.020> is

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
asked about how the hell hello games is

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.510 
asked about how the hell hello games is
making<00:01:58.860> these<00:01:58.950> procedurally<00:01:59.490> generated

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
making these procedurally generated

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.940 
making these procedurally generated
worlds<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.960> assumption<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.710> because

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
worlds and my assumption of this because

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.499 
worlds and my assumption of this because
I<00:02:02.070> felt<00:02:02.340> their<00:02:02.520> their<00:02:02.790> thoughts<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.329> this

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
I felt their their thoughts on this

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.359 
I felt their their thoughts on this
afterwards<00:02:04.110> were<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> little<00:02:04.409> bit<00:02:04.590> off<00:02:04.799> was

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
afterwards were a little bit off was

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.940 
afterwards were a little bit off was
that<00:02:05.610> um<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.240> feel<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:07.049> dice<00:02:07.350> went<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.799> them

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that um I feel that if dice went to them

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.900 
that um I feel that if dice went to them
per<00:02:08.340> se<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.580> mean<00:02:08.879> that

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
per se I mean that

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.730 
per se I mean that
I'm<00:02:10.000> guessing<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.450> they're<00:02:10.720> asking<00:02:11.170> how<00:02:11.680> do

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
I'm guessing that they're asking how do

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.830 
I'm guessing that they're asking how do
they<00:02:12.100> go<00:02:12.310> from<00:02:12.580> ground<00:02:12.970> combat<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.600> space

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
they go from ground combat to space

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.690 
they go from ground combat to space
combat<00:02:14.140> without<00:02:14.500> any<00:02:14.830> loading<00:02:15.100> screens<00:02:15.520> and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
combat without any loading screens and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.210 
combat without any loading screens and
sacrificing<00:02:16.300> detail<00:02:16.720> because<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.770> no<00:02:18.010> man's

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
sacrificing detail because in no man's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.770 
sacrificing detail because in no man's
sky<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.850> beautiful<00:02:19.300> world<00:02:19.450> it's

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
sky it's a beautiful world it's

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.840 
sky it's a beautiful world it's
graphically<00:02:20.320> just<00:02:20.590> great<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.040> detailing

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
graphically just great just detailing

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.840 
graphically just great just detailing
everything<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:22.660> it's<00:02:23.440> seamless<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.520> I'm

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
everything and it's seamless and I'm

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.790 
everything and it's seamless and I'm
thinking<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.510> dice<00:02:25.870> probably<00:02:26.260> 12<00:02:26.500> them<00:02:26.620> was

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
thinking that dice probably 12 them was

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.290 
thinking that dice probably 12 them was
like<00:02:26.950> hey<00:02:27.190> could<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:27.550> give<00:02:27.670> us<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.790> pointer

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
like hey could you give us a pointer

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.670 
like hey could you give us a pointer
because<00:02:28.450> we<00:02:28.780> kind<00:02:28.960> of<00:02:29.080> want<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.290> be<00:02:29.350> able<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.560> go

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
because we kind of want to be able to go

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.230 
because we kind of want to be able to go
from<00:02:29.890> ground<00:02:30.190> comment<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.700> space<00:02:30.970> combat

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
from ground comment the space combat

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.360 
from ground comment the space combat
without<00:02:31.510> sacrificing<00:02:32.350> any<00:02:32.470> attention<00:02:33.340> to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
without sacrificing any attention to

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.640 
without sacrificing any attention to
detail<00:02:33.820> or<00:02:33.970> anything<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:35.050> that's<00:02:35.500> a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
detail or anything and so that's a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.590 
detail or anything and so that's a
chance<00:02:35.920> there<00:02:36.250> but<00:02:36.640> my<00:02:36.820> guess<00:02:36.880> is<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.270> this

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
chance there but my guess is that this

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.360 
chance there but my guess is that this
most<00:02:38.110> likely<00:02:38.440> doesn't<00:02:38.620> really<00:02:38.830> pertain<00:02:39.040> to

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
most likely doesn't really pertain to

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.560 
most likely doesn't really pertain to
star<00:02:39.580> wars<00:02:39.700> battlefront<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:40.210> think<00:02:40.390> they<00:02:40.480> were

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
star wars battlefront I think they were

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.540 
star wars battlefront I think they were
just<00:02:40.690> kind<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:40.930> stretching<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.590> for<00:02:41.800> who<00:02:42.370> knows

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
just kind of stretching it for who knows

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.460 
just kind of stretching it for who knows
clicks<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:43.240> have<00:02:43.390> no<00:02:43.570> idea<00:02:43.690> that's<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.380> my

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
clicks I have no idea that's just my

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.230 
clicks I have no idea that's just my
assumption<00:02:44.950> though<00:02:45.100> but<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.790> feel<00:02:45.970> like<00:02:46.000> this

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
assumption though but I feel like this

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.200 
assumption though but I feel like this
would<00:02:46.360> apply<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:47.430> pretension<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.700> bioware's

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
would apply to pretension like bioware's

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.630 
would apply to pretension like bioware's
star<00:02:49.870> wars<00:02:50.080> game<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.470> they<00:02:50.650> are<00:02:50.800> rumored<00:02:51.610> to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
be working on that one surprised me at

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.100 
be working on that one surprised me at
all<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.550> would<00:02:54.970> definitely<00:02:55.210> fit<00:02:55.630> their<00:02:55.840> their
