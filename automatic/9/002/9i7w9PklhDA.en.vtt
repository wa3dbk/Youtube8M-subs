all those kind of lizards that require
UVA<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.310> UVB<00:00:23.539> but<00:00:24.539> what's<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:24.900> great<00:00:25.140> about

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
UVA and UVB but what's so great about

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.779 
UVA and UVB but what's so great about
this<00:00:25.619> bowl<00:00:25.830> because<00:00:26.160> there<00:00:26.279> are<00:00:26.400> plenty<00:00:26.609> of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
this bowl because there are plenty of

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.759 
this bowl because there are plenty of
mercury<00:00:27.150> vapor<00:00:27.359> bulbs<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> market<00:00:28.380> well

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
mercury vapor bulbs on the market well

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.130 
mercury vapor bulbs on the market well
these<00:00:28.890> things<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.400> last<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.599> testing

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
these things really last and the testing

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.959 
these things really last and the testing
on<00:00:31.289> these<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> amount<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.340> UVA<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.910> UVB

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
on these and the amount of UVA and UVB

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.740 
on these and the amount of UVA and UVB
is<00:00:33.510> absolutely<00:00:34.380> incredible<00:00:35.090> given<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.450> size

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is absolutely incredible given the size

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.750 
is absolutely incredible given the size
of<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> bulb<00:00:37.380> especially<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> 70<00:00:38.550> watt

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
of the bulb especially in the 70 watt

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.060 
of the bulb especially in the 70 watt
and<00:00:39.030> also<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.410> comes<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.190> 100<00:00:42.079> 160<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.230> 275

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
and also this comes in a 100 160 and 275

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.940 
and also this comes in a 100 160 and 275
so<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.879> every<00:00:45.180> type<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> enclosure<00:00:45.840> we've<00:00:46.680> got

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
so for every type of enclosure we've got

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.069 
so for every type of enclosure we've got
a<00:00:46.980> mercury<00:00:47.430> vapour<00:00:47.460> bulb<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.210> will<00:00:48.390> work<00:00:48.600> so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
a mercury vapour bulb that will work so

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.930 
a mercury vapour bulb that will work so
what's<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.800> big<00:00:49.950> deal<00:00:50.160> about<00:00:50.399> this

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
what's the big deal about this

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.970 
what's the big deal about this
particular<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.719> mega<00:00:52.020> right<00:00:52.289> well<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> big

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
particular like mega right well the big

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.660 
particular like mega right well the big
deal<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.430> simple<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.660> 71<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.890> 12-inch

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
deal is simple on the 71 the 12-inch

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.709 
deal is simple on the 71 the 12-inch
gives<00:00:57.449> 50<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.320> 70<00:00:58.890> microwatts<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.789> UVB<00:01:00.149> that's

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
gives 50 to 70 microwatts of UVB that's

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.020 
gives 50 to 70 microwatts of UVB that's
a<00:01:00.899> lot<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.379> power<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> little<00:01:02.430> bulb<00:01:02.760> like

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
a lot of power for a little bulb like

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.530 
a lot of power for a little bulb like
this<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> 100<00:01:05.519> 160<00:01:05.970> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
this and when we get to the 100 160 and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.580 
this and when we get to the 100 160 and
275<00:01:07.049> which<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.430> size<00:01:09.170> these<00:01:10.170> bulbs

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
275 which is all this size these bulbs

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.760 
275 which is all this size these bulbs
produce<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:12.170> 18<00:01:13.170> inches<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:15.020> 160<00:01:16.020> produces

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
produce at 18 inches the 160 produces

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.880 
produce at 18 inches the 160 produces
150<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.460> 200<00:01:17.909> micro<00:01:18.240> watts<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:19.380> back<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
150 to 200 micro watts going back to the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.030 
150 to 200 micro watts going back to the
100<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.970> produces<00:01:21.540> 150<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.140> 200<00:01:22.560> micro<00:01:22.830> watts

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
100 that produces 150 to 200 micro watts

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.300 
100 that produces 150 to 200 micro watts
at<00:01:23.280> 12<00:01:23.850> inches<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.229> 75<00:01:25.860> watt<00:01:26.159> which

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
at 12 inches and that to 75 watt which

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.030 
at 12 inches and that to 75 watt which
is<00:01:26.460> very<00:01:26.670> powerful<00:01:26.939> at<00:01:27.439> 24<00:01:28.439> inches<00:01:28.680> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
is very powerful at 24 inches that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.819 
is very powerful at 24 inches that
produces<00:01:29.549> also<00:01:29.810> 150<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.930> 200<00:01:31.380> micro<00:01:31.650> watts

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
produces also 150 to 200 micro watts

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.120 
produces also 150 to 200 micro watts
that's<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.700> an<00:01:32.850> extremely<00:01:33.750> sunny<00:01:34.320> day<00:01:34.710> in

the other great thing about these bulbs
are<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.470> 70<00:01:46.950> watt<00:01:47.100> will<00:01:47.340> fit<00:01:47.520> into<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.759> mini

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
are the 70 watt will fit into a mini

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.240 
are the 70 watt will fit into a mini
