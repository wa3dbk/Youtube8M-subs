00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.280
 to tam 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:17.130
 pulled the economy of the sea azov many rivers 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:21.810
 They talk about 7 6 8 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.150
 everything depends on the right foot here is that this is 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.200
 it's not worth the trouble you can not walk 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.329
 very 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.829
 so you 're doing it in the range of 10 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:37.020
 points with ten points and six average points 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:39.120
 the city always giving with high low 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 now they are at the first stop or at 15 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:49.230
 golden years 450 playing marching 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.290
 as here 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.620
 as you are walking settling 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:59.400
 at 10 o'clock taawon in second gear 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.439
 stopped now played the first lap the 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.619
 That's the brake, and then he's going to 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.149
 then he will put on the second one 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.759
 a little 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:17.670
 did not have time to vote for here 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:22.499
 here in the itajaÃ­ valley is not easy 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:30.499
 the france that is really all clogged up 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:36.600
 car here then already played the second 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:40.409
 to where new puts the first loose the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.259
 brake foot is already out walking so amarok 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.170
 it actually a level of economy 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.320
 he has a good economy a good 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.290
 same economy 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:56.280
 on the road already walking at a faster pace 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.000
 strong and there in the 110 to 140 will be 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.620
 doing in the middle range and walking 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.970
 in the city at a quieter pace 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.140
 he is doing in the range of 10 and a half 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.110
 close to 11 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.570
 it's all depends on the foot in it really 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.990
 They depend on the foot even shifting 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.010
 if you step on the drive for example and 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:27.620
 wants to overtake and yeasts march and 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.970
 When the rock in the bomb he tork and leave 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.300
 leaves 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.850
 I'm sorry for the advance, and changing gears. 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.250
 with a higher spin but when you 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.860
 walk in the soft in the tranquility then 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.390
 exchange the marches there in the thousand and 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.390
 two hundred american turns
