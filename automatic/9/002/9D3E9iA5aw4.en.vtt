what-if game by challenging from a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.130 
what-if game by challenging from a
leadership<00:00:20.010> standpoint<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.939> stick<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.990> don't

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140

necessarily definitely too weak to cut
it<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.840> mean<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.260> probably<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.529> different<00:00:25.859> test

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it I mean it's probably a different test
