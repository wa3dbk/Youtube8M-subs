but<00:00:47.170> in<00:00:47.289> essence<00:00:47.620> what<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.949> 40<00:00:48.249> plus<00:00:48.399> fly<00:00:48.760> line

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:48.999 
but in essence what the 40 plus fly line

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:50.729 
but in essence what the 40 plus fly line
is<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.239> little<00:00:49.629> bit<00:00:49.749> shorter<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.379> a<00:00:50.409> little<00:00:50.620> bit

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
is a little bit shorter and a little bit

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.919 
is a little bit shorter and a little bit
heavier<00:00:51.129> weight<00:00:51.429> forward<00:00:51.850> fly<00:00:52.089> line<00:00:52.359> with<00:00:52.899> a

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
heavier weight forward fly line with a

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.069 
heavier weight forward fly line with a
slightly<00:00:53.440> thicker<00:00:53.949> tip<00:00:54.370> diameter<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.719> if

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
slightly thicker tip diameter so if

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.989 
slightly thicker tip diameter so if
you're<00:00:56.229> casting<00:00:56.440> into<00:00:56.889> the<00:00:56.979> wind<00:00:57.190> or<00:00:57.579> let's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:57.999 
you're casting into the wind or let's

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.209 
you're casting into the wind or let's
say<00:00:58.149> your<00:00:58.329> strokes<00:00:59.260> aren't<00:00:59.559> perfect<00:00:59.979> and<00:01:00.129> your

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
say your strokes aren't perfect and your

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.189 
say your strokes aren't perfect and your
loops<00:01:00.399> are<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.579> little<00:01:00.760> bit<00:01:00.879> wider<00:01:01.149> that<00:01:01.600> little

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
loops are a little bit wider that little

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.890 
loops are a little bit wider that little
bit<00:01:02.319> heavier<00:01:02.679> tip<00:01:03.039> helps<00:01:03.729> kick<00:01:03.999> that<00:01:04.239> fly<00:01:04.540> over

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
bit heavier tip helps kick that fly over

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.240 
bit heavier tip helps kick that fly over
and<00:01:05.019> your<00:01:05.110> line<00:01:05.320> will<00:01:05.500> straighten<00:01:05.860> out<00:01:05.979> better

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
and your line will straighten out better

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.860 
and your line will straighten out better
so<00:01:06.670> it's<00:01:06.820> definitely<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.330> good<00:01:07.600> line<00:01:07.840> for

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
so it's definitely a good line for

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.380 
so it's definitely a good line for
distance<00:01:08.500> throwing<00:01:09.160> into<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.430> wind<00:01:09.700> but<00:01:09.940> on

all<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.410> way<00:01:44.500> at<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.680> other<00:01:44.710> end<00:01:45.040> it's<00:01:45.220> 47

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
all the way at the other end it's 47

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.620 
all the way at the other end it's 47
feet<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.900> has<00:01:47.110> about<00:01:47.410> a<00:01:47.790> 17<00:01:48.790> or<00:01:48.820> 18<00:01:49.330> foot<00:01:49.600> long

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
feet it has about a 17 or 18 foot long

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.600 
feet it has about a 17 or 18 foot long
front<00:01:50.110> taper<00:01:50.410> and<00:01:50.710> finishes<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.220> little<00:01:51.490> bit

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
front taper and finishes a little bit

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.990 
front taper and finishes a little bit
thinner

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
thinner

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.940 
thinner
the<00:01:52.450> thinner<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.900> front<00:01:53.140> taper<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.770> more

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
the thinner the front taper the more

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.920 
the thinner the front taper the more
energy<00:01:54.400> dissipation<00:01:54.910> so<00:01:55.540> when<00:01:55.660> I'm<00:01:55.750> throwing

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
energy dissipation so when I'm throwing

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.570 
energy dissipation so when I'm throwing
tight<00:01:56.290> loops<00:01:56.530> that<00:01:56.680> I<00:01:56.710> want<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.040> have<00:01:57.220> land

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
tight loops that I want to have land

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.760 
tight loops that I want to have land
softly<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.750> $0.06<00:01:59.260> line<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:01.300> next<00:02:02.110> step<00:02:02.470> is

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
softly the $0.06 line the next step is

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.370 
softly the $0.06 line the next step is
our<00:02:03.250> nymph<00:02:03.760> taper<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.690> airflow<00:02:04.960> ridged

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
our nymph taper and the airflow ridged

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.920 
our nymph taper and the airflow ridged
nymph<00:02:05.800> taper<00:02:06.220> line<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.700> one<00:02:07.210> that's<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.600> little

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
nymph taper line is one that's a little

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.540 
nymph taper line is one that's a little
bit<00:02:08.140> more<00:02:08.259> aggressive<00:02:08.709> than<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.920> standard<00:02:09.310> line

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
bit more aggressive than a standard line

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.970 
bit more aggressive than a standard line
has<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.119> longer<00:02:10.509> rear<00:02:10.840> taper<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.410> he<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.680> mend

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
has a longer rear taper so he can mend

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.920 
has a longer rear taper so he can mend
so<00:02:12.550> it's<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.730> great<00:02:13.000> line<00:02:13.210> for<00:02:13.450> nymph<00:02:13.690> and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
so it's a great line for nymph and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.559 
so it's a great line for nymph and
indicator<00:02:14.410> fishing<00:02:14.920> also<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.819> use<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.300> line

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
indicator fishing also I use this line

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.100 
indicator fishing also I use this line
when<00:02:16.750> I'm<00:02:16.870> through

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
when I'm through

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.990 
when I'm through
Hopper's<00:02:17.620> up<00:02:17.830> against<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.280> bank<00:02:18.520> anymore

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
Hopper's up against the bank anymore

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.210 
Hopper's up against the bank anymore
wind<00:02:19.450> resistance<00:02:19.990> fly<00:02:20.230> because<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:21.070> has<00:02:21.190> a

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
wind resistance fly because it has a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.400 
wind resistance fly because it has a
little<00:02:21.460> shorter<00:02:21.940> front<00:02:22.180> taper<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.870> just

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
little shorter front taper that just

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.140 
little shorter front taper that just
kicks<00:02:23.710> that<00:02:23.890> fly<00:02:24.130> over<00:02:24.400> just<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.790> little<00:02:25.030> bit

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
kicks that fly over just a little bit

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.450 
kicks that fly over just a little bit

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
harder when I don't know what I need and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.820 
harder when I don't know what I need and
I'm<00:02:27.550> fishing<00:02:27.790> kind<00:02:28.240> of<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.600> new<00:02:29.170> stream<00:02:29.620> or

something
I<00:02:30.400> grab<00:02:30.940> my<00:02:30.970> air<00:02:31.270> flow<00:02:31.480> trout<00:02:31.810> ridge<00:02:32.260> line<00:02:32.590> it's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
I grab my air flow trout ridge line it's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.490 
I grab my air flow trout ridge line it's
just<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:34.360> good<00:02:34.600> old<00:02:34.750> line<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.020> talked<00:02:35.410> about

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
just that good old line I talked about

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.920 
just that good old line I talked about
earlier<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:36.550> about<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.850> 40<00:02:37.270> foot<00:02:37.480> long<00:02:37.510> weight

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930
