00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.890 
machine tutorial series today we're
going<00:00:12.850> to<00:00:12.940> be<00:00:13.000> taking<00:00:13.240> a<00:00:13.330> look<00:00:13.420> at<00:00:13.570> the<00:00:13.690> sewer

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
going to be taking a look at the sewer

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.710 
going to be taking a look at the sewer
or<00:00:14.290> as<00:00:14.769> it's<00:00:15.160> called<00:00:15.370> an<00:00:15.610> nei<00:00:15.880> the<00:00:16.029> sewage

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
or as it's called an nei the sewage

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.440 
or as it's called an nei the sewage
collector<00:00:17.380> so<00:00:17.980> there's<00:00:18.369> no<00:00:18.610> real<00:00:19.000> user

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
collector so there's no real user

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.139 
collector so there's no real user
interface<00:00:19.960> for<00:00:20.439> the<00:00:20.650> sewer<00:00:21.009> all<00:00:21.640> it's<00:00:21.970> got

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:22.149 
interface for the sewer all it's got

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:23.909 
interface for the sewer all it's got
really<00:00:22.450> is<00:00:22.630> this<00:00:22.869> internal<00:00:23.290> storage<00:00:23.710> for

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
really is this internal storage for

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.400 
really is this internal storage for
liquid<00:00:24.250> and<00:00:24.399> then<00:00:24.820> a<00:00:24.849> spot<00:00:25.210> for<00:00:25.419> upgrades<00:00:25.930> but

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
liquid and then a spot for upgrades but

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.679 
liquid and then a spot for upgrades but
we'll<00:00:26.559> go<00:00:26.710> over<00:00:26.800> that<00:00:26.980> here<00:00:27.040> in<00:00:27.460> a<00:00:27.610> second<00:00:28.119> so

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
we'll go over that here in a second so

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.999 
we'll go over that here in a second so
if<00:00:28.809> we<00:00:28.930> go<00:00:29.050> ahead<00:00:29.169> and<00:00:29.320> take<00:00:29.529> a<00:00:29.590> look<00:00:29.800> at<00:00:29.919> the

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
if we go ahead and take a look at the

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.790 
if we go ahead and take a look at the
building<00:00:30.220> recipe<00:00:30.759> for<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.660> sewer<00:00:31.960> it<00:00:32.200> is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
building recipe for the sewer it is

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.020 
building recipe for the sewer it is
three<00:00:33.160> plastic<00:00:33.430> sheets<00:00:34.000> four<00:00:34.989> bricks<00:00:35.410> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
three plastic sheets four bricks a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.329 
three plastic sheets four bricks a
bucket<00:00:37.030> and<00:00:37.210> then<00:00:38.050> a<00:00:38.170> factory<00:00:38.649> machine<00:00:39.070> block

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
bucket and then a factory machine block

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.090 
bucket and then a factory machine block
which<00:00:40.120> is<00:00:40.149> just<00:00:40.929> three<00:00:41.199> plastic<00:00:41.679> sheets<00:00:41.920> and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
which is just three plastic sheets and

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.000 
which is just three plastic sheets and
three<00:00:42.339> stone<00:00:42.670> now<00:00:43.539> when<00:00:44.410> you<00:00:44.499> do<00:00:44.679> this<00:00:44.800> recipe

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
three stone now when you do this recipe

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.619 
three stone now when you do this recipe
it<00:00:45.309> actually<00:00:45.609> gives<00:00:45.760> you<00:00:45.850> for<00:00:46.179> sewage

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
it actually gives you for sewage

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.860 
it actually gives you for sewage
collectors<00:00:47.170> or<00:00:47.410> sewers<00:00:47.859> so<00:00:48.579> that<00:00:49.059> is<00:00:49.480> pretty

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
collectors or sewers so that is pretty

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.290 
collectors or sewers so that is pretty
nifty<00:00:50.109> if<00:00:50.679> we<00:00:51.429> go<00:00:51.550> ahead<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.789> take<00:00:51.969> a<00:00:52.030> look<00:00:52.239> at

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
nifty if we go ahead and take a look at

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.419 
nifty if we go ahead and take a look at
the<00:00:52.420> upgrades<00:00:52.809> for<00:00:53.079> this<00:00:53.260> machine<00:00:53.440> you<00:00:54.159> have

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
the upgrades for this machine you have

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.790 
the upgrades for this machine you have
all<00:00:54.699> these<00:00:55.030> different<00:00:55.300> kinds<00:00:56.019> of<00:00:56.079> upgrades

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
all these different kinds of upgrades

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.669 
all these different kinds of upgrades
that<00:00:56.949> you<00:00:57.069> can<00:00:57.219> do<00:00:57.339> the<00:00:57.940> first<00:00:58.569> upgrade<00:00:58.809> is<00:00:59.170> the

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
that you can do the first upgrade is the

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.680 
that you can do the first upgrade is the
lapis<00:01:00.129> upgrade<00:01:00.670> now<00:01:01.089> the<00:01:01.149> reason<00:01:01.539> you're

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
lapis upgrade now the reason you're

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.989 
lapis upgrade now the reason you're
probably<00:01:01.929> going<00:01:02.319> to<00:01:02.409> want<00:01:02.649> to<00:01:02.769> upgrade<00:01:03.519> this

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
probably going to want to upgrade this

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:07.710 
probably going to want to upgrade this
is<00:01:04.210> because<00:01:04.830> default<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:06.250> sewer<00:01:06.940> only

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
is because default the sewer only

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.530 
is because default the sewer only
collects<00:01:08.110> in<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.620> one<00:01:08.920> by<00:01:09.130> one<00:01:09.460> in<00:01:09.670> front<00:01:10.270> of<00:01:10.390> it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
collects in a one by one in front of it

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.930 
collects in a one by one in front of it
so<00:01:10.570> right<00:01:11.380> here<00:01:11.770> on<00:01:11.980> top<00:01:12.160> of<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.400> block<00:01:12.610> is<00:01:12.820> the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
so right here on top of the block is the

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.810 
so right here on top of the block is the
only<00:01:13.120> place<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:14.230> would<00:01:14.470> actually

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
only place that it would actually

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.180 
only place that it would actually
collect<00:01:15.820> sewage<00:01:16.390> so<00:01:17.290> you'll<00:01:17.620> usually<00:01:17.830> want<00:01:18.130> to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
collect sewage so you'll usually want to

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.310 
collect sewage so you'll usually want to
upgrade<00:01:18.340> that<00:01:18.700> for<00:01:18.910> your<00:01:19.000> animal<00:01:19.390> pins<00:01:19.630> so

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
upgrade that for your animal pins so

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.230 
upgrade that for your animal pins so
here<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.680> can<00:01:20.860> see<00:01:21.040> we<00:01:21.130> got<00:01:21.250> you<00:01:21.550> know<00:01:21.670> lapis

forth with the emerald upgrade being the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.610 
forth with the emerald upgrade being the
last<00:01:28.060> if<00:01:28.690> we<00:01:28.870> go<00:01:28.960> ahead<00:01:29.050> and<00:01:29.230> take<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.350> look<00:01:29.500> at

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
or the circular rubber just smelt it

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.900 
or the circular rubber just smelt it
down<00:01:40.930> in<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.140> furnace<00:01:41.590> now<00:01:42.070> all<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.490> these<00:01:42.640> share

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
ingots and so on and so forth a neat

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.660 
ingots and so on and so forth a neat
feature<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.170> sewage<00:01:56.530> collector<00:01:56.980> is<00:01:57.100> that

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
feature of the sewage collector is that

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.300 
feature of the sewage collector is that
depending<00:01:58.240> on<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.990> animal<00:01:59.830> that<00:01:59.980> you<00:02:00.040> have

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
depending on the animal that you have

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.210 
depending on the animal that you have
trapped<00:02:00.640> in<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.210> in<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.170> mod<00:02:02.380> pin<00:02:02.680> it'll

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
trapped in the in the mod pin it'll

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.060 
trapped in the in the mod pin it'll
actually<00:02:03.370> produce<00:02:03.640> more<00:02:03.760> or<00:02:04.300> less<00:02:04.740> sewage<00:02:05.740> so

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
actually produce more or less sewage so

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.109 
actually produce more or less sewage so
if<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:06.430> go<00:02:06.550> ahead<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:07.120> let's<00:02:07.420> spawn<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.750> chicken

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
if we go ahead and let's spawn a chicken

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.910 
if we go ahead and let's spawn a chicken
this<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.330> going<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.569> fill<00:02:10.780> up<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:11.110> lot<00:02:11.440> slower

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
this is going to fill up a lot slower

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.750 
this is going to fill up a lot slower
now<00:02:12.400> if<00:02:12.550> we<00:02:12.700> spawn<00:02:12.939> a<00:02:12.999> count<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:15.370> actually

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
now if we spawn a count it's actually

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.150 
now if we spawn a count it's actually
going<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:15.939> fill<00:02:16.209> up<00:02:16.359> faster<00:02:16.810> than

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
going to fill up faster than

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.340 
going to fill up faster than
chicken<00:02:17.460> one<00:02:17.640> will<00:02:17.880> if<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.960> take<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> look

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
chicken one will if we just take a look

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.770 
chicken one will if we just take a look
in<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.580> can<00:02:20.730> see<00:02:20.880> it's<00:02:21.060> not<00:02:21.270> producing

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
in here you can see it's not producing

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.870 
in here you can see it's not producing
very<00:02:22.050> quickly<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.530> think<00:02:22.680> as<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.980> was<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.220> four<00:02:23.640> and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
very quickly I think as I was a four and

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.990 
very quickly I think as I was a four and
if<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:24.990> look<00:02:25.170> at<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.440> one<00:02:25.710> if<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:26.760> catch

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
if we look at this one if we can catch

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.020 
if we look at this one if we can catch
it<00:02:27.030> twenty<00:02:27.570> six<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.460> see<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.730> here

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
it twenty six so you can see that here

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.400 
it twenty six so you can see that here
you<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.180> still<00:02:30.510> see<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.750> kind<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.020> glitching

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
you can still see it kind of glitching

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.770 
you can still see it kind of glitching
out<00:02:31.530> while<00:02:32.160> on<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.460> one<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.790> can't<00:02:33.120> so

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
out while on this one you can't so

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.210 
out while on this one you can't so
depending<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.500> mob<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.710> you<00:02:35.040> have

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
depending on the mob that you have

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.820 
depending on the mob that you have
within<00:02:35.430> or<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.030> top<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.990> sewage<00:02:37.350> collector

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
within or on top of the sewage collector

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.950 
within or on top of the sewage collector
you'll<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.430> different<00:02:38.610> rates<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.180> sewage

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
you'll get different rates of sewage

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.500 
you'll get different rates of sewage
production<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.520> like<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.850> said<00:02:42.090> earlier

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
production so like I said earlier

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.480 
production so like I said earlier
without<00:02:43.260> any<00:02:43.440> upgrades<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.160> sewage

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
without any upgrades the sewage

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.910 
without any upgrades the sewage
collector<00:02:44.910> only<00:02:45.240> actually<00:02:46.050> checks<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.530> one<00:02:46.770> by

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
collector only actually checks a one by

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.730 
collector only actually checks a one by
one<00:02:46.950> which<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.910> right<00:02:48.240> on<00:02:48.300> top<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.990> for<00:02:49.530> here

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
one which is right on top of it for here

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.500 
one which is right on top of it for here
what<00:02:50.040> we've<00:02:50.220> been<00:02:50.430> having<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.730> one<00:02:50.940> run<00:02:51.120> for

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
what we've been having this one run for

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.630 
what we've been having this one run for
let's<00:02:52.380> say<00:02:52.530> about<00:02:52.620> five<00:02:52.980> minutes<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.550> it's

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
let's say about five minutes and it's

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.760 
let's say about five minutes and it's
already<00:02:53.880> got<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> decent<00:02:54.270> amount<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.930> sewage

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
already got a decent amount of sewage

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.220 
already got a decent amount of sewage
collected<00:02:56.400> now<00:02:56.910> if<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.360> come<00:02:57.540> over<00:02:57.570> here<00:02:57.810> you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
collected now if we come over here you

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.010 
collected now if we come over here you
can<00:02:58.380> see<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.680> have<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.890> much<00:02:59.160> larger<00:03:00.020> pin

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
can see that I have a much larger pin

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.750 
can see that I have a much larger pin
and<00:03:01.440> if<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:01.950> take<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.130> look<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.430> here<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:02.640> can

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
and if we take a look in here you can

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.120 
and if we take a look in here you can
see<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:02.940> this<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.240> completely<00:03:03.750> filled<00:03:04.140> up<00:03:04.350> so

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
see that this is completely filled up so

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:13.040 
see that this is completely filled up so
if<00:03:05.430> we<00:03:06.590> just<00:03:07.590> get<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:08.190> tank<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:11.480> we<00:03:12.480> plot<00:03:12.780> that

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
if we just get a tank and we plot that

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.830 
if we just get a tank and we plot that
oops<00:03:13.440> down<00:03:14.040> right<00:03:14.820> here<00:03:15.120> if<00:03:15.360> we<00:03:15.420> go<00:03:15.630> ahead<00:03:15.720> and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
oops down right here if we go ahead and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.560 
oops down right here if we go ahead and
empty<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.350> out<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:17.280> can<00:03:17.460> see<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.700> produces

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
empty this out you can see it produces

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.980 
empty this out you can see it produces
about<00:03:19.310> 3/4<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.520> bucket<00:03:20.940> every<00:03:21.120> time<00:03:21.840> it

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
about 3/4 of a bucket every time it

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.110 
about 3/4 of a bucket every time it
collects<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.740> can<00:03:22.890> see<00:03:23.100> if<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.910> watch

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
collects like you can see if you watch

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.480 
collects like you can see if you watch
it<00:03:24.330> how<00:03:24.450> fast<00:03:24.720> it's<00:03:25.050> going<00:03:25.260> up<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:26.280> is

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
it how fast it's going up this is

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.100 
it how fast it's going up this is
because<00:03:26.820> we<00:03:26.970> have<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> bronze<00:03:27.480> upgrade<00:03:27.959> which

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
because we have a bronze upgrade which

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.280 
because we have a bronze upgrade which
is<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.530> 5<00:03:29.250> radius<00:03:29.790> increase<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:31.050> can<00:03:31.170> see

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
is a 5 radius increase and you can see

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.230 
is a 5 radius increase and you can see
that<00:03:31.380> we<00:03:31.470> got<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> decent<00:03:31.890> amount<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.370> cows<00:03:32.610> now

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
that we got a decent amount of cows now

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.699 
that we got a decent amount of cows now
if<00:03:33.360> all<00:03:33.480> these<00:03:33.600> cows<00:03:33.840> were<00:03:34.020> chickens<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.590> would

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
if all these cows were chickens it would

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.350 
if all these cows were chickens it would
still<00:03:34.950> be<00:03:34.980> producing<00:03:35.459> small<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:36.030> smaller

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
still be producing small a smaller

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.390 
still be producing small a smaller
amount<00:03:36.570> because<00:03:37.350> chickens<00:03:37.830> are<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.100> smaller

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
amount because chickens are just smaller

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.860 
amount because chickens are just smaller
animals<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:38.970> they<00:03:39.030> don't<00:03:39.209> produce<00:03:39.390> as<00:03:39.720> much

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
animals and they don't produce as much

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.020 
animals and they don't produce as much
sewage<00:03:40.200> now<00:03:41.100> what<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.459> can<00:03:41.610> do<00:03:41.760> with<00:03:41.910> this

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
sewage now what you can do with this

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.760 
sewage now what you can do with this
sewage<00:03:42.390> then<00:03:42.630> is<00:03:42.840> after<00:03:43.140> if<00:03:43.230> do<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.500> have<00:03:43.560> it

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
sewage then is after if do you have it

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.190 
sewage then is after if do you have it
all<00:03:43.890> stored<00:03:44.190> up<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:45.420> can<00:03:45.600> run<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.870> over<00:03:46.080> to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
all stored up is you can run it over to

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.540 
all stored up is you can run it over to
something<00:03:46.500> called<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.770> composter

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
something called a composter

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.250 
something called a composter
which<00:03:47.790> we'll<00:03:47.970> be<00:03:48.000> doing<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.300> tutorial<00:03:48.420> on<00:03:49.050> at<00:03:49.230> a

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
which we'll be doing a tutorial on at a

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.250 
which we'll be doing a tutorial on at a
later<00:03:49.530> time<00:03:50.120> but<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.239> composter<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:51.959> pretty

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
later time but the composter is pretty

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.610 
later time but the composter is pretty
useful<00:03:52.530> as<00:03:52.830> well<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.900> this<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.170> pretty<00:03:55.470> much

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
useful as well and this is pretty much

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.170 
useful as well and this is pretty much
the<00:03:55.830> only<00:03:55.980> machine<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.520> composter<00:03:57.030> can

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
the only machine that the composter can

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.449 
the only machine that the composter can
really<00:03:57.480> work<00:03:57.660> with<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.010> can<00:03:59.160> do<00:03:59.280> some

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
really work with but it can do some

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.470 
really work with but it can do some
other<00:03:59.550> cool<00:03:59.730> stuff<00:03:59.790> as<00:04:00.120> well

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
other cool stuff as well

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.420 
other cool stuff as well
but<00:04:00.840> we<00:04:01.110> will<00:04:01.260> cover<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.709> composter<00:04:02.280> in

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
but we will cover the composter in

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.760 
but we will cover the composter in
another<00:04:02.820> tutorial<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.200> guys<00:04:04.440> may<00:04:04.739> have

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
another tutorial so you guys may have

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.770 
another tutorial so you guys may have
noticed<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.310> we<00:04:05.550> didn't<00:04:05.790> go<00:04:05.940> over<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.239> power

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
noticed that we didn't go over a power

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.770 
noticed that we didn't go over a power
section<00:04:07.560> for<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.459> machine<00:04:08.850> this<00:04:09.270> is<00:04:09.480> because

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
section for this machine this is because

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.870 
section for this machine this is because
the<00:04:09.930> sewer<00:04:10.140> actually<00:04:10.739> doesn't<00:04:11.310> require<00:04:11.550> any

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
the sewer actually doesn't require any

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.320 
the sewer actually doesn't require any
power<00:04:12.150> doesn't<00:04:12.959> take<00:04:13.080> any<00:04:13.260> MJ<00:04:13.680> or<00:04:13.860> any<00:04:14.130> EU<00:04:14.400> so

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
power doesn't take any MJ or any EU so

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.659 
power doesn't take any MJ or any EU so
this<00:04:15.600> machine<00:04:15.959> will<00:04:16.140> just<00:04:16.320> run<00:04:16.650> by<00:04:16.890> itself<00:04:17.310> and

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
this machine will just run by itself and

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.610 
this machine will just run by itself and
you<00:04:17.700> don't<00:04:18.450> have<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.660> supply<00:04:18.930> anything<00:04:19.260> with

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
you don't have to supply anything with

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.560 
you don't have to supply anything with
it<00:04:19.859> but<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:20.640> is<00:04:20.760> going<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.940> be<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.239> end<00:04:21.359> of

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
it but that is going to be the end of

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.600 
it but that is going to be the end of
