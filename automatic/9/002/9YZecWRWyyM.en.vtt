00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.560
 for the other joke or what 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.019
 it's a joke about a flight 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.460
 Mexico-France before the start of the 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.020
 purists that you first have to fly 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.020
 no more joke 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.450
 it was a flight Mexico-France the pilot was 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.439
 surnamed lópez the copilot godínez and 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.759
 the stewardess pérez 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.950
 ok those are the characters and if any 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.630
 Once you've flown I hope that if you know that 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.250
 it's fun, especially vivaaerobus 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.570
 [Music] 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.570
 it's like an extreme sport 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.810
 because since you kiss the plane you're going 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.810

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.010

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.199
 arrival 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.390
 that is my funny part of 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.269
 vivaaerobus is when the pilots do 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.399
 the ads because they do them in Spanish 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.690
 and then in English the English of 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.690
 vivaaerobus more 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.820

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.400
 marching 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.540
 the beach floor and lit it 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.479
 for those who do not know what is the 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.460
 clutch is a pedal that we use the 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.460
 men to handle 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.460

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.460
 start the plane and the captain turns on the 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.869
 microphone and it tells the passengers and 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.299
 gentlemen thank you for choosing this 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.780

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.020
 okay 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.150
 and then we're going to go to a height of 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.940
 30,000 feet or the average sea ​​level to 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.180
 a speed of let's go fast I do not know 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.180
 cullen 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.180
 He also has not asked me how it is said 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.790
 speed 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.060
 and with the flight the estimated time 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.280
 we estimate we estimate our families 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.080
 obviously 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.380
 we value gifts that have value 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.380
 estimative 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.989
 and as you can the belt that we have not 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.410
 they start to fly but the captain does not 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.180
 turned off the microphone well then the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.640
 people from behind the passengers were going 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.290
 listening to what was happening in the booth and 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.180
 They heard that Lopez would ask 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.760
 godin that yagüe your wife got pregnant and 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.340
 he said yes thank god and how long 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.080
 they battled five years with a son and what 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.470
 you want it to be a girl a boy said that 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.470

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.110
 otherwise I'm worth mother 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.730
 because if people will listen back and the 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.060
 people giving me opinions that from the 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.060
 egg 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.460
 then everyone made his novel 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.050
 and suddenly you forget that the pilot 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.540
 is talking but imagine you're going 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.880
 flying over the ocean and listening to the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.400
 voice of the pilot on the horns that screams 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.360
 desperate 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:35.330
 It was worth more than what happened or we are not going to 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.190
 drop all the people stopped the stewardess 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.260
 what happened 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.520
 in a collective hysteria and a priest 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.620
 I was shouting at them we're all going to die 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.620
 regrets children of his fucking mother 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.500
 a lady runs down the aisle I 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.750
 I always wanted to be god fucking and all 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.910
 as it existed at that time no 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.060
 and the stewardess fighting with everyone 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.770
 calm sit down, nothing happens, run 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.790

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.790
 heck microphone 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.450

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.010

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.730

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.819

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.660
 all the people are to seat the priest 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.660
 I'm watching people 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.250
 and the lady who ran told them to 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.250
 they believed it 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.000
 or I'm an actress and fuck 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.900
 this is an improvisation exercise 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.900
 what did i do 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.210
 and all them uncomfortable and captain 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.370
 I said an apology I shouted 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.660
 effectively I shouted it was not my 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.140
 intention to scare them what happens is that 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.140
 I was silent 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.210
 or I burned an egg to those who were 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.340
 do not circulate 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.560
 and that's why I scream but the plane is fine 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.560
 in fact I'm fine except the egg 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.650
 and to all the people who are uncomfortable not the 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.050
 captain for breaking the ice he wanted to 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.990
 do the funny and said man if 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.580
 Mother had seen that it was 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.630
 They would like you to see how my 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.670

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.720
