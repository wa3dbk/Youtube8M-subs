00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.540 
take the hair we're just going to wrap
it<00:02:33.580> around<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.270> ponytail<00:02:34.930> like<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.560> and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
it around the ponytail like this and

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.640 
it around the ponytail like this and
then<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.330> is<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.660> best<00:02:38.020> way<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.350> figured

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
then this is the best way that I figured

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.070 
then this is the best way that I figured
out<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:39.010> works<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:40.390> can<00:02:40.510> also<00:02:40.660> like<00:02:40.840> wrap<00:02:41.050> it

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
out it works you can also like wrap it

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.870 
out it works you can also like wrap it
around<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.440> soft<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:41.920> that's<00:02:42.069> sort<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.400> hard<00:02:42.790> to

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
around a soft but that's sort of hard to

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.030 
around a soft but that's sort of hard to
do<00:02:43.120> unless<00:02:43.510> you're<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:44.080> really<00:02:44.260> little<00:02:45.900> yeah
