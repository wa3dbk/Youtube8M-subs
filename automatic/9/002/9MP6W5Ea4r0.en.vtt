00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
these goes into a manifold that's about

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.690 
these goes into a manifold that's about
ten<00:02:05.869> holes<00:02:06.170> depending<00:02:07.039> on<00:02:07.130> how<00:02:07.280> many<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.549> use

ten holes depending on how many you use

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.609 
ten holes depending on how many you use
there's<00:02:08.000> some<00:02:08.630> in<00:02:08.750> there<00:02:08.899> with<00:02:09.050> maybe<00:02:09.259> four

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
there's some in there with maybe four
