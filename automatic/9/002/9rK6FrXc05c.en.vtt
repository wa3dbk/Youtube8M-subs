about which material I prefer to use in

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.150 
about which material I prefer to use in
my<00:00:17.100> guinea<00:00:17.340> pig<00:00:17.430> cage<00:00:17.760> fleece<00:00:18.360> or<00:00:18.690> carefresh

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
my guinea pig cage fleece or carefresh

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.760 
my guinea pig cage fleece or carefresh
now<00:00:20.160> I'll<00:00:20.610> talk<00:00:20.880> about<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.390> pros<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.410> cons

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
now I'll talk about the pros and cons

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.960 
now I'll talk about the pros and cons
and<00:00:23.400> why<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> prefer<00:00:24.920> fleece<00:00:25.920> over<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> carefresh

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
and why I prefer fleece over a carefresh

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.979 
and why I prefer fleece over a carefresh
now<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.990> first<00:00:28.560> reason<00:00:29.220> why<00:00:29.790> I<00:00:29.820> prefer<00:00:30.329> fleece

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
now the first reason why I prefer fleece

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.540 
now the first reason why I prefer fleece
it's<00:00:31.320> because<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.829> much<00:00:32.279> less<00:00:32.489> expensive

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
it's because it's much less expensive

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.319 
it's because it's much less expensive
than<00:00:33.329> carefresh<00:00:34.310> it<00:00:35.310> depends<00:00:35.850> where<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.150> get

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
than carefresh it depends where you get

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
than carefresh it depends where you get
police<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.810> if<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.050> get<00:00:37.440> police<00:00:37.829> let's<00:00:38.160> say

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
police but if you get police let's say

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.090 
police but if you get police let's say
at<00:00:38.430> Walmart<00:00:38.850> where<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.829> could

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
at Walmart where I get it then it could

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.490 
at Walmart where I get it then it could
be<00:00:41.130> under<00:00:41.640> $20<00:00:42.390> depending<00:00:42.630> on<00:00:42.870> how<00:00:43.020> many<00:00:43.079> yards

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
be under $20 depending on how many yards

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.380 
be under $20 depending on how many yards
you<00:00:43.680> get<00:00:43.800> whereas<00:00:44.100> carefresh<00:00:44.609> for<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> big<00:00:45.149> bag

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
you get whereas carefresh for a big bag

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.470 
you get whereas carefresh for a big bag
is<00:00:45.719> I'm<00:00:46.199> assuming<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> medium<00:00:48.300> bags

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
is I'm assuming I I get the medium bags

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.939 
is I'm assuming I I get the medium bags
of<00:00:48.690> care<00:00:48.840> first<00:00:49.050> from<00:00:49.199> my<00:00:49.320> hamster<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
of care first from my hamster which is

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.849 
of care first from my hamster which is
already<00:00:50.280> $20<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.929> get<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.109> large<00:00:52.559> bag

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
already $20 so if you get a large bag

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.669 
already $20 so if you get a large bag
it'll<00:00:53.160> probably<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.300> $30<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
it'll probably be over $30 which is a

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.669 
it'll probably be over $30 which is a
lot<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.609> expensive<00:00:57.289> considering<00:00:58.289> that

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
lot really expensive considering that

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.079 
lot really expensive considering that
you<00:00:58.829> would<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> new<00:00:59.609> care<00:00:59.850> fresh

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
you would have to get a new care fresh

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.100 
you would have to get a new care fresh
bag<00:01:00.359> I'm<00:01:01.320> assuming<00:01:02.539> considering<00:01:03.539> how<00:01:03.660> big<00:01:03.929> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
bag I'm assuming considering how big the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.450 
bag I'm assuming considering how big the
cages<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.980> have<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
cages are and then you have to have a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.220 
cages are and then you have to have a
good<00:01:05.670> layer<00:01:05.910> of<00:01:05.940> care<00:01:06.330> fresh<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.780> assuming

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
good layer of care fresh I'm assuming

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.020 
good layer of care fresh I'm assuming
that<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.400> get<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.550> new<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:08.850> at

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
that you would have to get a new one at

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.920 
that you would have to get a new one at
least<00:01:09.620> once<00:01:10.620> or<00:01:10.800> twice<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.100> month<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.930> with

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
least once or twice a month and with

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.170 
least once or twice a month and with
fleece<00:01:13.290> it'll<00:01:13.710> last<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.280> my<00:01:14.790> police<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.750> get

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
fleece it'll last you my police I get

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.500 
fleece it'll last you my police I get
probably<00:01:18.230> every<00:01:19.230> month<00:01:19.500> or<00:01:20.100> two<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.640> it's

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
probably every month or two and it's

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.860 
probably every month or two and it's
much<00:01:22.110> under<00:01:23.010> $30<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.000> depends<00:01:24.450> where<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.690> get

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
much under $30 it depends where you get

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.640 
much under $30 it depends where you get
it<00:01:24.990> at<00:01:25.110> Walmart

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
it at Walmart

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.220 
it at Walmart
it's<00:01:25.770> definitely<00:01:26.100> cheap<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.940> if<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:28.200> a

to have a cheap fabric for your guinea

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.190 
to have a cheap fabric for your guinea
pig<00:01:38.400> cage<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:42.020> thought<00:01:43.020> at

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
pig cage is because it's I I thought at

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.880 
pig cage is because it's I I thought at
first<00:01:43.230> that<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.830> would<00:01:43.980> be<00:01:44.130> easy<00:01:44.400> to<00:01:44.550> wash<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
first that it would be easy to wash the

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.920 
first that it would be easy to wash the
fleece<00:01:46.890> each<00:01:47.160> week<00:01:47.400> but<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.700> gets<00:01:47.850> very<00:01:47.940> dirty

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
fleece each week but it gets very dirty

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.680 
fleece each week but it gets very dirty
and<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.950> practical<00:01:50.730> to<00:01:50.760> wash<00:01:51.120> every<00:01:51.510> week

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
and not practical to wash every week

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.320 
and not practical to wash every week
it's<00:01:52.290> much<00:01:52.590> easier<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.370> you<00:01:53.400> just<00:01:53.730> throw<00:01:54.150> it

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
it's much easier if you just throw it

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.750 
it's much easier if you just throw it
all<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.480> once<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.050> week<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.380> put<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.860> fresh<00:01:56.310> new

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
all out once a week and put in fresh new

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.370 
all out once a week and put in fresh new
fabric<00:01:57.690> one<00:01:58.110> every<00:01:59.040> week<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.960> that's<00:02:01.140> why

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
fabric one every week and so that's why

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.110 
fabric one every week and so that's why
it's<00:02:01.560> nice<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.980> get<00:02:02.070> cheap<00:02:02.370> fabric<00:02:02.910> so<00:02:03.090> that

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
it's nice to get cheap fabric so that

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.640 
it's nice to get cheap fabric so that
you<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.540> replace<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.870> each<00:02:04.110> week<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.560> it

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
you can replace it each week and it

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.800 
you can replace it each week and it
won't<00:02:04.800> cost<00:02:05.010> you<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.370> lot<00:02:05.640> whereas<00:02:06.240> carefresh

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
won't cost you a lot whereas carefresh

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.770 
won't cost you a lot whereas carefresh
will<00:02:07.230> cost<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.860> lot<00:02:08.099> but<00:02:08.509> it's<00:02:09.509> definitely

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
will cost you a lot but it's definitely

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
pig cage because the pee soaks right

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.840 
pig cage because the pee soaks right
through<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.840> fleece<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.220> don't<00:02:33.490> have<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
through the fleece so you don't have the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.460 
through the fleece so you don't have the
pee<00:02:34.030> smell<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.450> that's<00:02:34.570> really<00:02:34.810> what<00:02:35.200> does

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
pee smell and that's really what does

pee smell and that's really what does
smell<00:02:35.890> with<00:02:36.070> guinea<00:02:36.280> pigs<00:02:36.550> is<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.910> pee<00:02:37.120> but

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
smell with guinea pigs is the pee but

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.940 
smell with guinea pigs is the pee but
you<00:02:37.420> do<00:02:37.570> not<00:02:37.720> smell<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.230> at<00:02:38.320> all<00:02:38.470> because<00:02:38.680> it

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
you do not smell it at all because it

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.890 
you do not smell it at all because it
just<00:02:39.070> goes<00:02:39.640> right<00:02:39.970> through<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.360> police<00:02:40.600> and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
just goes right through the police and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.440 
just goes right through the police and
it's<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:42.160> lot<00:02:43.000> better

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
it's a lot better

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.950 
it's a lot better
whereas<00:02:44.170> carefresh<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:46.060> would<00:02:46.270> still<00:02:46.540> smell

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
whereas carefresh you would still smell

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.590 
whereas carefresh you would still smell
it<00:02:46.990> I<00:02:47.200> assume<00:02:47.650> I'm<00:02:48.100> not<00:02:48.460> I<00:02:48.760> can't<00:02:49.450> give<00:02:49.570> a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
it I assume I'm not I can't give a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.260 
it I assume I'm not I can't give a
definite<00:02:50.080> answer<00:02:50.140> because<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:51.100> haven't<00:02:51.970> use

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
definite answer because I haven't use

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.550 
definite answer because I haven't use
carefresh<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:52.900> here<00:02:53.050> because<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.290> knew<00:02:53.440> about

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
carefresh in here because I knew about

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.190 
carefresh in here because I knew about
the<00:02:53.890> really<00:02:54.700> how<00:02:55.090> expensive<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.780> was<00:02:55.810> each

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
the really how expensive it was each

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.920 
the really how expensive it was each
week<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:57.010> that's<00:02:57.250> why<00:02:57.460> I<00:02:57.490> started<00:02:58.150> with<00:02:58.240> police

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
week so that's why I started with police

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.360 
week so that's why I started with police
instead<00:02:59.380> but<00:02:59.890> I<00:02:59.920> remember<00:03:00.370> going<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:02.370> friends

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
and they used shavings and you could

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.190 
and they used shavings and you could
smell<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:10.000> pee<00:03:10.180> from<00:03:10.510> down<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.930> stairs

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
whereas with police you can't smell it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.360 
whereas with police you can't smell it

definitely<00:03:47.890> create<00:03:48.370> an<00:03:48.640> odor<00:03:48.820> but<00:03:49.000> if<00:03:49.120> you're

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
why I like police better is it's much

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.180 
why I like police better is it's much
easier<00:04:04.210> to<00:04:04.270> clean<00:04:04.630> all<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.410> droppings<00:04:05.920> and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
easier to clean all the droppings and

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.100 
easier to clean all the droppings and
hay<00:04:06.520> and<00:04:06.550> fallen<00:04:07.240> food<00:04:07.450> off<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.720> ground<00:04:07.900> wires

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
hay and fallen food off the ground wires

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.890 
hay and fallen food off the ground wires
and<00:04:08.320> carefresh<00:04:08.830> it<00:04:09.070> may<00:04:09.340> be<00:04:09.970> harder<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.420> see

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
and carefresh it may be harder to see

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.810 
and carefresh it may be harder to see
all<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.380> droppings<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.130> it<00:04:12.310> would<00:04:12.400> be<00:04:12.520> harder

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
all the droppings so it would be harder

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.640 
all the droppings so it would be harder
to<00:04:12.850> clean<00:04:13.240> up<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:14.140> mess

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
to clean up that mess

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.610 
to clean up that mess
whereas<00:04:15.610> with<00:04:15.940> police<00:04:16.210> it's<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:16.750> easy<00:04:17.080> to<00:04:17.230> just

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
whereas with police it's so easy to just

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.380 
whereas with police it's so easy to just
spot<00:04:18.130> all<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.580> little<00:04:18.850> things<00:04:19.060> so<00:04:19.150> you<00:04:19.239> need

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
spot all the little things so you need

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.030 
spot all the little things so you need
to<00:04:19.480> pick<00:04:19.630> up<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:19.989> then<00:04:20.109> it's<00:04:20.260> really<00:04:20.560> quick<00:04:20.799> I

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
to pick up and then it's really quick I

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.070 
to pick up and then it's really quick I
just<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.880> takes<00:04:22.120> me<00:04:22.300> about<00:04:22.330> five<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.900> 10

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
just it takes me about five to 10

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.930 
just it takes me about five to 10
minutes<00:04:23.200> each<00:04:23.500> night<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:24.010> clean<00:04:24.250> out<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.730> cage

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
minutes each night to clean out the cage

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.480 
minutes each night to clean out the cage
and<00:04:25.210> then<00:04:25.360> I'm<00:04:25.960> done<00:04:26.290> and<00:04:26.500> it's<00:04:26.620> looks<00:04:27.250> and

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
and then I'm done and it's looks and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.180 
and then I'm done and it's looks and
smells<00:04:27.670> a<00:04:27.850> lot<00:04:27.970> better<00:04:28.530> now<00:04:29.530> if<00:04:29.770> you're<00:04:29.950> going

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.000 
layer newspaper and then a second layer
newspaper<00:05:13.450> just<00:05:13.720> to<00:05:13.780> be<00:05:13.900> more<00:05:14.050> absorbent<00:05:14.350> but

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
newspaper just to be more absorbent but

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.350 
newspaper just to be more absorbent but
you<00:05:15.130> can<00:05:15.280> do<00:05:15.370> one<00:05:15.550> layer<00:05:15.730> newspaper<00:05:16.150> doesn't

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
you can do one layer newspaper doesn't

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.440 
you can do one layer newspaper doesn't
matter<00:05:16.600> and<00:05:17.080> then<00:05:17.110> I<00:05:17.890> have<00:05:18.430> like<00:05:18.940> kitchen

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450

garbage<00:05:19.990> bags<00:05:20.290> as<00:05:21.100> the<00:05:21.370> bottom<00:05:21.640> layer<00:05:21.790> so<00:05:22.480> I

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
garbage bags as the bottom layer so I

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.720 
garbage bags as the bottom layer so I
have<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:23.020> garbage<00:05:23.710> bags<00:05:23.919> at<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.190> bottom<00:05:24.550> so

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
have the garbage bags at the bottom so

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.180 
have the garbage bags at the bottom so
that<00:05:24.760> it's<00:05:24.970> easier<00:05:25.300> to<00:05:25.450> roll<00:05:25.690> all<00:05:25.960> of<00:05:26.470> the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
that it's easier to roll all of the

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.310 
that it's easier to roll all of the
layers<00:05:27.400> up<00:05:27.700> at<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.000> end<00:05:28.150> of<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.900> week<00:05:29.080> because

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
at the end of the week where I put all

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.680 
at the end of the week where I put all

the layers and roll it all up and throw

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.500 
the layers and roll it all up and throw
it<00:06:25.780> away<00:06:25.870> takes<00:06:26.710> really<00:06:27.340> only<00:06:27.820> about<00:06:28.090> ten

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
it away takes really only about ten

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.360 
it away takes really only about ten
minutes<00:06:28.780> so<00:06:29.110> it's<00:06:29.229> really<00:06:29.530> really<00:06:29.770> quick<00:06:30.190> and

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
minutes so it's really really quick and

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.310 
minutes so it's really really quick and
efficient<00:06:30.940> which<00:06:31.390> is<00:06:31.540> another<00:06:31.810> reason<00:06:32.020> why<00:06:32.200> I

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
efficient which is another reason why I

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.500 
efficient which is another reason why I
really<00:06:32.590> like<00:06:32.830> using<00:06:33.040> fleece<00:06:33.520> whereas<00:06:34.300> with

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
really like using fleece whereas with

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.719 
really like using fleece whereas with
carefresh<00:06:34.990> you<00:06:35.229> would<00:06:35.350> have<00:06:35.530> to<00:06:35.680> pick<00:06:36.400> it<00:06:36.580> all

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
carefresh you would have to pick it all

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.630 
carefresh you would have to pick it all
out<00:06:36.940> by<00:06:37.150> hand<00:06:37.180> and<00:06:37.720> then<00:06:37.930> put<00:06:38.440> it<00:06:38.560> like<00:06:39.310> put<00:06:39.610> a

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
out by hand and then put it like put a

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.110 
out by hand and then put it like put a
new<00:06:39.880> fresh<00:06:40.270> carefresh<00:06:40.750> in<00:06:40.990> which<00:06:41.590> would

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
new fresh carefresh in which would

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.140 
new fresh carefresh in which would
excuse<00:06:43.120> me<00:06:43.150> would<00:06:43.990> take<00:06:44.290> so<00:06:45.099> much<00:06:45.340> longer<00:06:45.400> I'm

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
excuse me would take so much longer I'm

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.430 
excuse me would take so much longer I'm
guessing<00:06:46.570> I<00:06:46.690> haven't

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
guessing I haven't

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.620 
guessing I haven't
but<00:06:47.770> I<00:06:47.830> know<00:06:47.890> with<00:06:48.070> my<00:06:48.250> hamster<00:06:48.700> cage<00:06:48.910> just

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
but I know with my hamster cage just

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.970 
but I know with my hamster cage just
putting<00:06:49.900> in<00:06:49.990> care<00:06:50.170> first<00:06:50.380> for<00:06:50.500> the<00:06:50.560> hamster

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
putting in care first for the hamster

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.310 
putting in care first for the hamster
takes<00:06:51.190> about<00:06:51.420> ten<00:06:52.420> minutes<00:06:52.450> and<00:06:52.990> that's<00:06:53.140> a

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
takes about ten minutes and that's a

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.430 
takes about ten minutes and that's a
small<00:06:53.680> cage<00:06:54.010> but<00:06:54.910> with<00:06:55.150> this<00:06:55.270> huge<00:06:55.780> cage<00:06:56.110> it

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
small cage but with this huge cage it

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.890 
small cage but with this huge cage it
would<00:06:56.590> probably<00:06:56.860> take<00:06:57.190> about<00:06:58.000> 15<00:06:58.480> to<00:06:58.510> 20

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
would probably take about 15 to 20

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.510 
would probably take about 15 to 20
minutes<00:06:59.200> depending<00:06:59.260> how<00:06:59.620> fast<00:06:59.920> you<00:07:00.160> are<00:07:00.190> so<00:07:00.490> I

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
minutes depending how fast you are so I

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
minutes depending how fast you are so I
just<00:07:00.790> think<00:07:01.000> fleece<00:07:01.660> is<00:07:01.840> much<00:07:02.080> more<00:07:02.350> efficient

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
just think fleece is much more efficient

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.850 
just think fleece is much more efficient
alright<00:07:04.540> that's<00:07:04.870> my<00:07:05.080> opinion

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
alright that's my opinion

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.510 
alright that's my opinion
of<00:07:06.010> which<00:07:06.820> I<00:07:07.000> prefer<00:07:07.210> fleece<00:07:07.720> or<00:07:08.020> care<00:07:08.260> fresh

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
of which I prefer fleece or care fresh

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.370 
of which I prefer fleece or care fresh
again<00:07:09.520> it's<00:07:09.730> your<00:07:10.240> decision<00:07:10.930> of<00:07:11.020> which<00:07:11.200> one

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
again it's your decision of which one

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.380 
again it's your decision of which one
you<00:07:11.530> want<00:07:11.710> to<00:07:11.860> buy<00:07:12.070> my<00:07:12.400> main<00:07:12.610> concern<00:07:13.030> was<00:07:13.210> how

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.390 
you want to buy my main concern was how

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.570 
you want to buy my main concern was how
expensive<00:07:13.720> carefresh<00:07:14.380> is<00:07:14.590> so<00:07:14.860> that's<00:07:15.070> why<00:07:15.250> I

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
expensive carefresh is so that's why I

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.720 
expensive carefresh is so that's why I
wanted<00:07:16.480> to<00:07:16.540> get<00:07:17.410> fleece<00:07:17.740> instead<00:07:18.310> but<00:07:18.580> it's

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.730 
wanted to get fleece instead but it's

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.400 
wanted to get fleece instead but it's
totally<00:07:18.970> your<00:07:19.450> decision<00:07:19.510> on<00:07:20.110> what<00:07:20.260> you're

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410
