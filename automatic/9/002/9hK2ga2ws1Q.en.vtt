00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello people i was at psn today 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.390
 Let me change my psx 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.490
 let me sting about a month ago 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.040
 have you also in the video 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.449
 I have seen new piercings info video 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.150
 can or now synonymous in this video 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.750
 and also in the livestream 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.189
 yes, yes, and I just wanted 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.930
 let's say that's what it says 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.199
 You ask in it how it was if we did 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.210
 has things so I started with that 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.790
 laptop I have a horseshoe like that now 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.410
 in it belongs can not sing 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.530
 oh my hair does not stand up either 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.530
 bad 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:50.969
 yamaha stand out ok so that's where I ask 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:55.649
 Now here's a horseshoe right now 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.449
 a bit wrong and I find 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.160
 actually a bit fancier even 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.420
 even more than what I had before 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.070
 this this this banana because you have it 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.630
 not only half looks but one sees 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.630
 it or you just can not see it 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.040
 so you can turn it away when the older one 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.080
 is not supposed to look or or when 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.840
 somebody the employer does not do that 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.110
 have seen or so to get easy 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.310
 turn out again so yes when inserting 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.939
 it only has a little bit of it once in a while 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.890
 hurt 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.299
 yes, but only because he somehow that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.590
 that hole just is not that right 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.350
 that did not really work that way 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.229
 doll hurts or a bit stop yes 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.220
 So it was against that I had the previous 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.200
 was a pretty small one 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.119
 In the beginning he has me very small 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.770
 Law with small people standing together 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.110
 balls and I found the absolutely carelessly 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 was just around my nose 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.320
 I thought that was really stupid 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.630
 then I told him that I did 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.509
 do not want to have and then it has 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.070
 several changes so it has bigger 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.390
 made and even the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.830
 bring apart a bit more 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.770
 bent just a smiley 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.560
 it always hangs when I talk but 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.500
 it does not matter that has the change 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.730
 Not at all the smiley 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.860
 I did not feel like it again 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.290
 when stinging yes then I still wanted 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.760
 say I have almost 500 subscribers now 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.100
 there you will also find 4 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.120
 and I had that in a video 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.400
 ever hinted 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.080
 it's like this now if I have this 500 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.400
 I would like to have subscribers full 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.239
 quite like a raffle states and 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.040
 that will probably over then 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.780
 So Facebook would be great if 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.239
 then you my side I also inclined 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.150
 I'll link that down again 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.770
 in the description spox because then you are 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.180
 you can also keep up to date 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.070
 also noticed if the lost 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.780
 it starts and there it gets 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.450
 then, for example, a cd from me too 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.640
 Gain where I among other things 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.420
 I do not have any songs on it yet 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.160
 Internet published and yes times 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.650
 look what's up there I am there 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.910
 I can even think of something nice 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.190
 would you really 10 again 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:09.250
 I had my t-shirt printed that way 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.590
 looks the chic part yes that's me 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.220
 I'm sure in my next video too 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.380
 be seen 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.140
 So if you want to have something like that drives 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.579
 I'll fix everything then 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.350
 or left in the comments 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.989
 what would you be for a raffle 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.070
 waving so what prices of course 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:34.380
 are also feasible 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:36.489
 write it in the comments and what 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.540
 did you have in the calendar today? 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.540
