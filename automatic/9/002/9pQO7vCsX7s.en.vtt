00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the Premier League this season more

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.410 
the Premier League this season more
goals<00:01:39.720> than<00:01:39.900> Balotelli<00:01:40.740> Lambert<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.579> borini

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
combined and and yeah I think Burnley

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.639 
combined and and yeah I think Burnley
don't<00:01:46.710> want<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> sell<00:01:48.119> him<00:01:48.149> right<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:48.930> because

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
don't want to sell him right now because

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.160 
don't want to sell him right now because
their<00:01:50.159> Premier<00:01:50.640> League<00:01:50.820> survival<00:01:51.170> will

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
their Premier League survival will

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.080 
their Premier League survival will
depend<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.799> Danny<00:01:53.040> ings<00:01:53.250> banging<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
depend on Danny ings banging in the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.319 
depend on Danny ings banging in the
goals<00:01:54.299> for<00:01:54.659> them<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.820> see<00:01:57.030> why<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329

Johnson<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.570> mean<00:04:19.010> not<00:04:20.010> renew<00:04:20.579> his<00:04:20.760> contract

Johnson I mean not renew his contract
because<00:04:21.660> he's<00:04:21.840> just<00:04:22.079> not<00:04:22.740> good<00:04:22.950> enough<00:04:22.980> and

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
because he's just not good enough and

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.200 
because he's just not good enough and
indefinitely<00:04:25.500> bring<00:04:25.800> in<00:04:25.950> another<00:04:26.250> defender<00:04:26.940> I

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
at the moment I think our defense is

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.170 
at the moment I think our defense is
pretty<00:04:31.560> solid<00:04:31.830> but<00:04:32.190> definitely<00:04:32.730> get<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:32.940> new

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
pretty solid but definitely get a new

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.380 
pretty solid but definitely get a new

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
fit is training with the squad so he's

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.070

available available for the West Ham

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.100 
available available for the West Ham
game<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:56.700> think<00:04:56.910> that's<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.600> reason<00:04:57.810> why

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
game so I think that's the reason why

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.770 
game so I think that's the reason why
why<00:04:58.740> Liverpool<00:04:59.220> would<00:04:59.430> be<00:05:00.000> willing<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.600> do<00:05:00.750> a

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
why Liverpool would be willing to do a

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.990 
why Liverpool would be willing to do a
deal<00:05:00.900> like<00:05:01.290> this<00:05:01.350> with<00:05:02.010> Danny's<00:05:02.400> because<00:05:02.880> we

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
deal like this with Danny's because we

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.730 
deal like this with Danny's because we
know<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.150> near<00:05:03.480> storages<00:05:03.960> back<00:05:04.200> but<00:05:04.650> the

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
know the near storages back but the

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.560 
know the near storages back but the
problem<00:05:04.890> is<00:05:05.190> that<00:05:05.220> Danny<00:05:05.550> asaji<00:05:06.060> is<00:05:06.180> injury

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
problem is that Danny asaji is injury

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.750 
problem is that Danny asaji is injury
problem<00:05:06.990> we<00:05:07.080> don't<00:05:07.260> know<00:05:07.470> how<00:05:07.680> long<00:05:08.280> he<00:05:08.640> will

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
problem we don't know how long he will

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.840

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.200 
keep fit he can broke breakdown at any
moment<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.570> Brendan<00:05:13.230> Rodgers<00:05:13.560> is<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:14.210> risking

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
moment and Brendan Rodgers is a risking

injured again we'll be back in the goals
for<00:05:36.990> liverpool<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.740> to<00:05:38.340> fire<00:05:38.610> us<00:05:38.940> into<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.419> top

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
for liverpool to to fire us into the top

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.650 
for liverpool to to fire us into the top
four<00:05:39.870> so<00:05:40.229> it's<00:05:40.350> a<00:05:40.440> very<00:05:40.680> risky<00:05:40.919> risky<00:05:41.880> tactic

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
four so it's a very risky risky tactic

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.690 
four so it's a very risky risky tactic
by<00:05:43.080> Liverpool<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:43.680> Brad<00:05:43.890> Rogers<00:05:44.160> but<00:05:44.669> I

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
by Liverpool and Brad Rogers but I

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.490 
by Liverpool and Brad Rogers but I
really<00:05:45.120> hope<00:05:45.240> that<00:05:45.450> storage<00:05:45.870> stays<00:05:46.169> fit

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
really hope that storage stays fit

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.170 
really hope that storage stays fit
because<00:05:46.830> if<00:05:46.979> he<00:05:47.100> stays<00:05:47.310> fit<00:05:47.610> in<00:05:47.760> your<00:05:47.880> score<00:05:48.150> a

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
because if he stays fit in your score a

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.210 
because if he stays fit in your score a
lot<00:05:48.450> of<00:05:48.630> goals<00:05:48.870> in<00:05:49.020> this<00:05:49.140> team<00:05:49.410> because<00:05:49.979> the

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
lot of goals in this team because the

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.960 
lot of goals in this team because the
Liverpool<00:05:50.640> team<00:05:51.740> creates<00:05:52.740> a<00:05:52.950> lot<00:05:53.190> of<00:05:53.460> chances

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
Liverpool team creates a lot of chances
