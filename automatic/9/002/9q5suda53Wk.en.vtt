which<00:00:31.349> I'm<00:00:31.830> happy<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.239> got<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.140> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
which I'm happy to have got that but it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.229 
which I'm happy to have got that but it
also<00:00:34.590> came<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:36.469> two<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.620> two<00:00:38.550> more<00:00:38.700> cats<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
also came with two of two more cats the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.190 
also came with two of two more cats the
yellow<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> blue<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:42.200> apparently

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
yellow and the blue and apparently

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.290 
yellow and the blue and apparently
seemed<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:43.950> everything<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.850> but

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
seemed to have everything with them but

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.029 
seemed to have everything with them but
evidently<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.570> guy<00:00:48.690> knew<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:48.960> he<00:00:49.170> had<00:00:49.469> well

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
evidently the guy knew what he had well

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.470 
evidently the guy knew what he had well
I'm<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.190> seeing<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.610> he<00:00:50.760> done<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:50.969> but

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
I'm not seeing that he done it but

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.119 
I'm not seeing that he done it but
someone<00:00:51.899> did<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.469> they<00:00:52.710> took<00:00:52.860> all<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
someone did because they took all the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.970 
someone did because they took all the
identifying<00:00:53.730> markings<00:00:54.210> off<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.980> because

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
identifying markings off of it because

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.319 
identifying markings off of it because
I'm<00:00:57.469> positive<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.910> these<00:00:59.910> are<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> ones

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
I'm positive that these are the ones

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.910 
I'm positive that these are the ones
that<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:00.690> under<00:01:00.899> recall<00:01:01.199> too<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:01.739> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
that was under recall too because it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.490 
that was under recall too because it
still<00:01:02.100> says<00:01:02.370> 1981<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.420> Taiwan<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.350> but

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
still says 1981 in Taiwan right here but

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.539 
still says 1981 in Taiwan right here but
some<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.769> us<00:01:04.830> took<00:01:06.170> machined<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.549> something

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
some of us took machined out something

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.130 
some of us took machined out something
similar<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> dremel<00:01:09.510> tool<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.990> went

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
similar to a dremel tool and went

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.940 
similar to a dremel tool and went
through<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> plastic<00:01:10.850> on<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.060> embossing<00:01:12.330> on
