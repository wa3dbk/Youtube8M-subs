00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.500 
properly was when he fired out his hand
and<00:06:22.780> I<00:06:22.930> got<00:06:23.170> in<00:06:23.320> front<00:06:23.620> of<00:06:23.710> his<00:06:23.830> hand

as in like behind him in between them

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.670 
as in like behind him in between them
that<00:06:28.180> was<00:06:28.330> the<00:06:28.360> only<00:06:28.540> way<00:06:28.810> I<00:06:28.840> could<00:06:29.050> defeat<00:06:29.500> him

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
that was the only way I could defeat him

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.210 
that was the only way I could defeat him
before

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
before

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.680 
before
well<00:06:30.370> not<00:06:30.490> defeat<00:06:30.760> him<00:06:30.910> but<00:06:31.090> damage<00:06:31.420> him<00:06:31.540> I've

never<00:06:31.720> actually<00:06:32.170> to<00:06:32.470> beat<00:06:32.650> this<00:06:32.830> guy

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.730 

ballsy<00:06:36.820> I<00:06:37.090> thought<00:06:37.570> this<00:06:37.990> video<00:06:38.200> was<00:06:38.380> worth

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
ballsy I thought this video was worth

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.260 
ballsy I thought this video was worth
keeping<00:06:39.010> so<00:06:39.550> I<00:06:39.580> just<00:06:39.940> like<00:06:40.210> keep<00:06:40.660> it

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.260 

I'll<00:06:45.050> do<00:06:45.289> that<00:06:45.979> I<00:06:46.009> thought<00:06:46.639> maybe<00:06:46.880> when<00:06:47.090> you

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
I'll do that I thought maybe when you

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.420 
I'll do that I thought maybe when you
reform<00:06:47.660> the<00:06:47.840> other<00:06:47.990> period<00:06:48.500> of<00:06:48.650> time<00:06:49.099> where<00:06:49.400> I

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
reform the other period of time where I

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.820 
reform the other period of time where I
could<00:06:49.729> damage<00:06:50.000> it<00:06:50.240> but<00:06:50.479> beyond<00:06:53.650> this<00:06:54.650> is

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
could damage it but beyond this is

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:01.230 
could damage it but beyond this is
really<00:06:55.250> failure<00:06:55.699> right<00:06:55.849> now<00:06:56.030> isn't<00:06:56.210> it

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.000

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
that's inconsistent and what does that

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:19.240 
that's inconsistent and what does that
do<00:07:10.760> I<00:07:10.790> wonder<00:07:10.970> if<00:07:11.060> that<00:07:11.120> does<00:07:11.450> anything

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.250 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.000
