00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.780
 I believe that this match against the year is 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.230
 I think that 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:14.309
 for them what will be a match 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.230
 like the others despite having already 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.090
 got the title but 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.240
 and they're going to want to finish well in their 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.849
 court celebrate this last match 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.880
 winning on their court and we with 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.410
 the need to try to win the 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.300
 results have helped us then that 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.529
 it did not feel safe to feel with the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.420
 hope that we can earn me 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.760
 monumental 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.190
 and well let's take it as such 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.539
 responsibility and we will treat things 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.460
 as we have been doing naturally 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.800
 so we have a great game in 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.750
 general line and that we can achieve that 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.799
 triumph that we need I think it is 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.869
 fundamental to be concentrated 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:54.460
 ninety-five minutes to be played and 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:56.739
 Above all, try to achieve solidity 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.260
 that we were having, we trust 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.850
 in which we are going to make a good match and 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.680
 in which we will always depend on 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.819
 we also sing of not listening 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.039
 nothing but how do you make it impossible but more 

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:11.740
 that you depend on other tests winning 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:17.520
 and rafaela out there is not losing and 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.520
 Sanjuán are killing and have a goal 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.600
 when he is winning and rafaela goes squeezing 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.590
 and is thinking that in the accumulated 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.159
 rafaela if we are not governing there is a 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.679
 lots of keys that can be given but 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.319
 I think it's quite complicated 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.090
 we are watching what happens 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.460
 in other fields we do not remember 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.659
 play as we are doing and you're welcome 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.490
 serves then let's continue with the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.830
 same story today san martín depends on 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.930
 San Martin 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.550
 and good happens on the courts if we 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.410
 we win we are interested so I have to 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.970
 make match match that we 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.090
 same play smart upfield 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.250
 we do not give ourselves away knowing that we play a 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.150
 match 90 minutes and match can be 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.870
 win at 5 to 90 so 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.830
 tranquility I think I have a lot 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.230
 tranquility and the group is fine 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.670
 we are going to continue to fight the 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.110
 party as we left to fight in all 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.180
 sides not only intermediate we will not stop 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.520
 there and try to play well as 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.140
 we come feels like converting it as 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.580
 we have been doing as well to be able to 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.830
 get a positive result and win 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.620
 win in the monumental here as already 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.520
 I said it and we go try to play 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.030
 as we have been doing 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.110
 lately how much good football 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.690
 trying to add and in this match 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.010
 we can add three already would be ideal 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.990
 we are very optimistic are a 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.569
 small team but we have a good group 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.670
 in a locker room and I think when 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.319
 a team gets that you can for 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.319
 great things today we are fighting this 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.730
 like fighting the descent and I think we 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.700
 we deserve for the last stretch of the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.560
 we have a whole championship watching 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.540
 province behind the family all our 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.480
 that being support these guys have done 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.939
 an enormous effort that the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.500
 things as well as possible are fighting 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.260
 for a place in first for a place of 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.500
 to leave it at the club at first with 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.400
 top and 18 19 years does not usually happen in 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.650
 Regarding the problems we have had 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.510
 The truth is that if we talk to each other 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.150
 complicates the most important thing as I told you 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.790
 try to think about us not so much in 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.099
 the rivals clear in ourselves 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.290
 situation and try to quantify to be 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.449
 a good match this Sunday for more 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.850
 that nothing for the joy of the people and 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:25.180
 from the city 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.180
 ayala
