00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090 

now<00:00:00.570> you<00:00:00.630> can<00:00:00.840> see<00:00:01.050> that<00:00:01.079> we<00:00:01.530> have<00:00:01.560> our<00:00:01.860> proof

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
now you can see that we have our proof

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.660 
now you can see that we have our proof
and<00:00:03.020> I<00:00:04.020> think<00:00:04.710> there's<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.920> couple<00:00:05.040> areas<00:00:05.310> that

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
and I think there's a couple areas that

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.210 
and I think there's a couple areas that
could<00:00:05.790> use<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.330> little<00:00:06.569> more<00:00:06.839> work<00:00:07.140> I'd<00:00:07.859> like

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
could use a little more work I'd like

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.980 
could use a little more work I'd like
the<00:00:08.400> side<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.330> bridge<00:00:09.690> this

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
the side of this this bridge this

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.320 
the side of this this bridge this
abstract<00:00:10.469> form<00:00:10.740> here<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.820> stand<00:00:12.120> out<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
abstract form here to to stand out a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.360 
abstract form here to to stand out a
little<00:00:12.540> bit<00:00:12.750> more<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.530> go<00:00:13.650> back<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:14.130> and

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
little bit more so I can go back in and

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.560 
little bit more so I can go back in and
cut<00:00:15.920> what's<00:00:16.920> nice<00:00:17.130> now<00:00:17.430> at<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.820> point<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
cut what's nice now at this point to is

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.590 
cut what's nice now at this point to is
you<00:00:18.960> can<00:00:19.140> actually<00:00:19.170> see<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:21.060> block<00:00:23.600> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
you can actually see on the block the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.820 
you can actually see on the block the
dark<00:00:24.930> versus<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.890> light<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.680> there's<00:00:28.680> two

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
dark versus the light so there's two

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.580 
dark versus the light so there's two
things<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:30.080> go<00:00:31.080> ahead<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
things you can do here go ahead and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
things you can do here go ahead and
begin<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.040> cut<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.460> block<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.000> ink<00:00:33.329> on

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
begin to cut the block with the ink on

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.850 
begin to cut the block with the ink on
it<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.530> your<00:00:34.739> marks<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.250> well

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
it and you can see your marks as well

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.490 
it and you can see your marks as well
maybe<00:00:37.860> taking<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> piece<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.520> paper<00:00:39.230> to<00:00:40.230> hold

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
maybe taking a piece of paper to hold

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.840 
maybe taking a piece of paper to hold
the<00:00:41.129> block<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.610> place<00:00:42.829> or<00:00:43.829> using<00:00:44.610> another

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the block in place or using another

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.819 
the block in place or using another
block<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.960> hold<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:46.739> get

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
block you can hold it so you don't get

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.750 
block you can hold it so you don't get
any<00:00:47.010> con<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.309> hands<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.550> I'll

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
any con your hands you can see that I'll

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.670 
any con your hands you can see that I'll
probably<00:00:51.000> reveal<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.350> why<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
probably reveal this this is why it's a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.279 
probably reveal this this is why it's a
proof<00:00:52.949> I'll<00:00:53.520> go<00:00:53.730> back<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> really<00:00:55.110> like

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
proof I'll go back in here I really like

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.410 
proof I'll go back in here I really like
this<00:00:55.879> street<00:00:56.879> light<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:59.340> reveal<00:00:59.670> itself<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.300> i

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
this street light to reveal itself and i

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
this street light to reveal itself and i
think<00:01:00.719> i'm<00:01:00.870> actually<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.620> cut<00:01:01.800> some

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
think i'm actually going to cut some

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.539 
think i'm actually going to cut some
marks<00:01:03.019> across<00:01:04.019> as<00:01:04.439> well<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:06.630> kind<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.900> show<00:01:07.549> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
marks across as well to kind of show the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.730 
marks across as well to kind of show the
light<00:01:08.790> from<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> street<00:01:09.540> pole<00:01:09.990> street<00:01:10.500> lamp

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
light from the street pole street lamp

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.670 
light from the street pole street lamp
itself<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.479> maybe<00:01:12.479> rough<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.200> background

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
itself and maybe rough up the background

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.890 
itself and maybe rough up the background
a<00:01:13.950> little<00:01:14.010> bit<00:01:14.369> more<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.640> create<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> graze<00:01:15.509> so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
a little bit more to create a graze so

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.990 
a little bit more to create a graze so
that<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.920> dominant<00:01:17.490> shape<00:01:17.729> here

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that this this dominant shape here

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.960 
that this this dominant shape here
stands<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.930> well<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> all's<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.580> need<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.820> do

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
stands out as well so all's I need to do

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.260 
stands out as well so all's I need to do
is<00:01:21.210> reinvestigate<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> block<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.710> my<00:01:22.890> tools

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.620 

so<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.509> see<00:01:27.689> I'm<00:01:27.890> reinforcing<00:01:29.630> some

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
so you can see I'm reinforcing some

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.380 
so you can see I'm reinforcing some
contrast<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:31.680> image<00:01:37.100> yeah<00:01:38.210> making<00:01:39.210> sure

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
contrast in my image yeah making sure

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.760 
contrast in my image yeah making sure
that<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.900> nice<00:01:40.189> bigger<00:01:41.189> shape<00:01:41.610> shows<00:01:42.060> up<00:01:42.770> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
that this nice bigger shape shows up and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.880 
that this nice bigger shape shows up and
I'm<00:01:43.890> also<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.369> back<00:01:44.640> through<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.890> defining

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
I'm also going back through and defining

00:01:46.890 --> 00:02:01.750 
I'm also going back through and defining
my<00:01:47.250> horizon<00:01:47.909> line<00:01:48.090> here

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.820 

so<00:02:02.760> now<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.090> I've<00:02:03.180> made<00:02:03.330> my<00:02:03.510> Corrections<00:02:04.020> I'm

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
so now that I've made my Corrections I'm

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.199 
so now that I've made my Corrections I'm
going<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.190> prove<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.610> wood<00:02:06.119> block<00:02:06.300> again

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
going to prove this wood block again

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.609 
going to prove this wood block again
which<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.420> believe<00:02:09.690> will<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.899> my<00:02:10.170> finished

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
which I believe will be my finished

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:49.580 
which I believe will be my finished
complete<00:02:11.370> image<00:02:44.269> mala<00:02:45.269> as<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:47.850> can<00:02:47.970> see<00:02:48.590> here

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
complete image mala as you can see here

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.410 
complete image mala as you can see here
are<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.709> two<00:02:49.890> proofs<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.580> pulled<00:02:50.940> off<00:02:51.150> my

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
are the two proofs that I pulled off my

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.250 
are the two proofs that I pulled off my
wood<00:02:51.989> block<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:53.519> is<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.060> first<00:02:54.300> state<00:02:54.630> and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
wood block this is the first state and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.500 
wood block this is the first state and
here<00:02:56.160> we<00:02:56.280> have<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.580> second<00:02:56.970> state<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.330> this

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
here we have the second state of this

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.940 
here we have the second state of this
wood<00:02:57.720> block<00:02:58.730> in<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.910> first<00:03:00.150> state<00:03:00.560> all<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.829> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
wood block in the first state all of the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.490 
wood block in the first state all of the
bottom<00:03:02.280> information<00:03:02.910> primarily<00:03:03.660> remain<00:03:04.320> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
bottom information primarily remain the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.490 
bottom information primarily remain the
same<00:03:05.120> that's<00:03:06.120> up<00:03:06.269> here<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.690> sky<00:03:07.019> so<00:03:07.440> to

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
same that's up here in the sky so to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.970 
same that's up here in the sky so to
speak<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.890> where<00:03:08.040> I've<00:03:08.190> changed<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:09.180> image<00:03:09.329> I

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
speak is where I've changed the image I

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
really enjoyed this light pole coming up

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.930 
really enjoyed this light pole coming up
in<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.680> initial<00:03:14.000> photograph<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.480> wanted<00:03:15.930> to

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
in the initial photograph so I wanted to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.729 
in the initial photograph so I wanted to
reinforce<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.630> fact<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.260> was<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> light

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739
