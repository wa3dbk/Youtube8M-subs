back and then follow right away with
your<00:02:06.189> left<00:02:06.399> foot<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:12.250> it's<00:02:12.400> not<00:02:12.519> fair<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.760> say

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
your left foot so it's not fair to say

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.789 
your left foot so it's not fair to say
that<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.360> because<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.690> can<00:02:14.200> surf<00:02:14.380> all<00:02:14.620> right

that I'm gonna be able
not<00:02:17.490> right<00:02:17.670> away<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:18.090> think<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.569> time<00:02:18.780> you'll

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
not right away I think in time you'll

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.990 
not right away I think in time you'll
get<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.560> when<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:20.250> have<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.520> skills<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.970> got

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
get it when you have the skills you got

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.210 
get it when you have the skills you got
the<00:02:21.180> basic<00:02:21.959> balance<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.410> do<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:22.830> probably

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
the basic balance to do it so probably

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.010 
the basic balance to do it so probably
so<00:02:23.459> much<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:24.180> just<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.599> sir<00:02:24.690> begin<00:02:24.959> to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
so much and just like it sir begin to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.240 
so much and just like it sir begin to
bend<00:02:25.170> your<00:02:25.290> knees<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.680> your<00:02:25.920> center

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.650 
bend your knees so that your center
gravity<00:02:26.400> stays<00:02:26.760> low<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.090> your<00:02:27.209> balance<00:02:27.569> on

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
gravity stays low and your balance on

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.270 
gravity stays low and your balance on
