everybody is Brian and I'm back today to
revisit<00:00:09.020> an<00:00:09.080> old<00:00:09.200> project<00:00:09.410> if<00:00:09.800> you<00:00:09.889> remember

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
revisit an old project if you remember

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.220 
revisit an old project if you remember
from<00:00:10.219> about<00:00:10.730> a<00:00:10.760> year<00:00:11.059> ago<00:00:11.090> I<00:00:11.540> had<00:00:11.690> the<00:00:11.719> Cessna

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
from about a year ago I had the Cessna

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.060 
from about a year ago I had the Cessna
206<00:00:12.920> T<00:00:13.250> trainer<00:00:14.000> model<00:00:14.240> with<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:15.019> flaps<00:00:15.290> the

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
206 T trainer model with the flaps the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.800 
206 T trainer model with the flaps the
the<00:00:16.520> models<00:00:16.820> been<00:00:16.970> upgrades<00:00:17.270> a<00:00:17.390> little<00:00:17.660> bit

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
the models been upgrades a little bit

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.269 
the models been upgrades a little bit
new<00:00:18.020> manufacturer<00:00:18.710> or<00:00:18.860> something<00:00:19.130> like<00:00:19.220> that

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
new manufacturer or something like that

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.600 
new manufacturer or something like that
and<00:00:19.900> a<00:00:20.900> couple<00:00:21.289> of<00:00:21.470> changes<00:00:21.830> are<00:00:22.039> metal

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
and a couple of changes are metal

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.849 
and a couple of changes are metal
landing<00:00:23.030> gear<00:00:23.330> had<00:00:24.199> a<00:00:24.230> different<00:00:24.770> radio<00:00:25.130> and

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
landing gear had a different radio and

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.740 
landing gear had a different radio and
some<00:00:27.859> changes<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:28.460> flaps<00:00:28.760> now<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.240> flaps

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
some changes the flaps now the flaps

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.660 
some changes the flaps now the flaps
that<00:00:29.960> came<00:00:30.199> out<00:00:30.410> of<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:30.560> box<00:00:30.800> on<00:00:31.010> my<00:00:31.070> new<00:00:31.430> one

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
that came out of the box on my new one

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.590 
that came out of the box on my new one
were<00:00:32.660> reversed<00:00:33.050> meaning<00:00:33.710> that<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.699> the<00:00:35.449> down

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
were reversed meaning that the the down

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.180 
were reversed meaning that the the down
position<00:00:35.780> was<00:00:36.230> level<00:00:36.500> with<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:36.739> wings<00:00:36.920> and

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
position was level with the wings and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.819 
position was level with the wings and
the<00:00:37.640> opposition<00:00:38.390> was<00:00:38.809> up<00:00:39.050> above<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.410> wings<00:00:39.590> so

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
the opposition was up above the wings so

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.340 
the opposition was up above the wings so
uh<00:00:39.860> what's<00:00:40.640> called<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.880> reflex<00:00:41.329> flap<00:00:41.600> not

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
uh what's called a reflex flap not

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.380 
uh what's called a reflex flap not
particularly<00:00:42.800> useful<00:00:43.010> on<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.340> trainer<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:43.969> this

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
particularly useful on a trainer so this

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.810 
particularly useful on a trainer so this
video<00:00:44.719> is<00:00:44.930> just<00:00:44.960> going<00:00:45.380> to<00:00:45.620> go<00:00:45.800> through<00:00:46.130> the

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
video is just going to go through the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.000 
video is just going to go through the
process<00:00:47.059> of<00:00:47.450> getting<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.170> flaps<00:00:48.410> to<00:00:48.620> work<00:00:48.800> in

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
process of getting the flaps to work in

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.639 
process of getting the flaps to work in
a<00:00:49.489> more<00:00:49.670> scale<00:00:49.969> like<00:00:50.180> or<00:00:50.480> Mariner<00:00:51.140> at<00:00:51.320> proper

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
a more scale like or Mariner at proper

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.090 
a more scale like or Mariner at proper
arrived<00:00:51.920> fashion<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:52.969> let's<00:00:53.149> have<00:00:53.270> a<00:00:53.329> look<00:00:54.100> so

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
arrived fashion so let's have a look so

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.560 
arrived fashion so let's have a look so
this<00:00:55.250> is<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.489> new<00:00:55.640> model<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.149> as<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.390> can<00:00:56.539> see

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
this is the new model and as you can see

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.170 
this is the new model and as you can see
it<00:00:56.930> looks<00:00:57.170> similar<00:00:57.860> to<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.910> old<00:00:59.030> one

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
it looks similar to the the the old one

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
it looks similar to the the the old one
I'm<00:00:59.360> just<00:00:59.510> going<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.660> show<00:00:59.750> you<00:00:59.870> what<00:01:00.079> the

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
I'm just going to show you what the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.439 
I'm just going to show you what the
flaps<00:01:00.440> did<00:01:00.649> online<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:01.670> this<00:01:01.879> is<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:02.210> down

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
flaps did online so this is the down

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.329 
flaps did online so this is the down
position<00:01:02.660> of<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.079> flaps<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.649> Epis<00:01:03.949> is

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
position of the flaps and the Epis is

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.090 
position of the flaps and the Epis is
way<00:01:05.270> too<00:01:05.330> high<00:01:05.750> that's<00:01:06.170> not<00:01:06.380> right<00:01:06.590> right<00:01:06.860> you

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
way too high that's not right right you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.430 
way too high that's not right right you
want<00:01:07.250> them<00:01:07.369> to<00:01:07.399> go<00:01:07.520> down<00:01:08.080> so<00:01:09.080> what<00:01:09.229> we're<00:01:09.350> going

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
want them to go down so what we're going

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.020 
want them to go down so what we're going
to<00:01:09.530> do<00:01:09.679> is<00:01:09.860> we're<00:01:10.069> going<00:01:10.160> to<00:01:10.220> reverse<00:01:10.550> them<00:01:10.789> so

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
to do is we're going to reverse them so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.330 
to do is we're going to reverse them so
that<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.569> this<00:01:11.840> is<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.080> up<00:01:12.289> position<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.800> the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
that the this is the up position and the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.130 
that the this is the up position and the
down<00:01:13.550> position<00:01:13.789> is<00:01:14.149> going<00:01:14.330> to<00:01:14.479> be<00:01:14.660> obviously

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
down position is going to be obviously

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.359 
down position is going to be obviously
below<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.160> wing<00:01:16.340> let's<00:01:17.090> get<00:01:17.240> started<00:01:18.369> alright

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
below the wing let's get started alright

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.919 
below the wing let's get started alright
so<00:01:19.490> here's<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.819> flap<00:01:20.030> set<00:01:20.270> up<00:01:20.360> on<00:01:20.509> this<00:01:20.660> model

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
so here's the flap set up on this model

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.139 
so here's the flap set up on this model
as<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.649> can<00:01:21.770> see<00:01:21.950> we've<00:01:22.130> got<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.399> servo<00:01:22.819> here

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
as you can see we've got the servo here

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.660 
as you can see we've got the servo here
that's<00:01:23.660> connected<00:01:24.619> via<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:24.950> servo<00:01:25.220> control

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
that's connected via the servo control

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.139 
that's connected via the servo control
arm<00:01:25.880> push<00:01:26.810> rod<00:01:27.050> clevis<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.550> control<00:01:28.910> horn

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
arm push rod clevis and the control horn

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.120 
arm push rod clevis and the control horn
which<00:01:29.300> drives<00:01:29.569> the<00:01:29.720> flaps<00:01:30.080> this<00:01:30.740> is<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:30.979> full

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
which drives the flaps this is the full

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.710 
which drives the flaps this is the full
down<00:01:31.399> position<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.119> guys<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.390> can<00:01:32.509> see

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
down position and you guys you can see

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.130 
down position and you guys you can see
the<00:01:32.959> flap<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:34.360> flush<00:01:35.360> with<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.599> trailing<00:01:36.050> edge

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
the flap is flush with the trailing edge

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.440 
the flap is flush with the trailing edge
of<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.349> wing<00:01:36.410> that's<00:01:36.800> not<00:01:36.950> we<00:01:37.099> want<00:01:37.399> we<00:01:38.209> can

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
of the wing that's not we want we can

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.419 
of the wing that's not we want we can
adjust<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.319> length<00:01:39.500> of<00:01:39.679> this<00:01:39.830> control<00:01:40.250> arm

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
adjust the length of this control arm

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.249 
adjust the length of this control arm
but<00:01:40.640> that<00:01:40.789> doesn't<00:01:41.060> give<00:01:41.149> us<00:01:41.209> when<00:01:41.840> we<00:01:41.869> do<00:01:42.080> that

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
but that doesn't give us when we do that

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.419 
but that doesn't give us when we do that
it<00:01:42.380> doesn't<00:01:42.590> give<00:01:42.679> us<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.830> whole<00:01:42.979> lot<00:01:43.009> of<00:01:43.160> length

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
it doesn't give us a whole lot of length

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.010 
it doesn't give us a whole lot of length
the<00:01:44.030> problem<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:46.640> as<00:01:47.179> you<00:01:47.360> can<00:01:47.539> see<00:01:47.750> this

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
the problem is that as you can see this

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.290 
the problem is that as you can see this
server<00:01:48.319> alarm<00:01:48.619> is<00:01:48.890> vertical<00:01:49.789> and<00:01:49.910> that's<00:01:50.090> at

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
server alarm is vertical and that's at

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.979 
server alarm is vertical and that's at
an<00:01:50.420> extent<00:01:50.840> if<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:51.560> move<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.220> switch<00:01:52.910> over<00:01:53.330> it

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
an extent if I move the switch over it

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:57.100 
an extent if I move the switch over it
goes<00:01:54.229> way<00:01:54.500> too<00:01:54.530> far<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.330> back<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:56.599> it's<00:01:56.959> over

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
goes way too far and back and it's over

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.260 
goes way too far and back and it's over
driving<00:01:57.440> so<00:01:58.220> what<00:01:58.340> we<00:01:58.429> need<00:01:58.550> to<00:01:58.610> do<00:01:58.849> is<00:01:59.090> adjust

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
driving so what we need to do is adjust

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.559 
driving so what we need to do is adjust
the<00:01:59.690> servo<00:01:59.959> arm<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:00.979> that<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.819> gets<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.330> full

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
the servo arm so that it gets the full

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.790 
the servo arm so that it gets the full
length<00:02:04.479> forward<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.660> back<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.560> essentially

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
length forward and back so essentially

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.249 
length forward and back so essentially
has<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.039> go<00:02:07.160> about<00:02:07.399> 45<00:02:07.849> degrees<00:02:08.030> back<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:09.080> let's

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
has to go about 45 degrees back so let's

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.000 
has to go about 45 degrees back so let's
have<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.470> look<00:02:09.649> at<00:02:09.739> how<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:09.920> do<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:11.829> okay<00:02:12.829> as

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
have a look at how to do that okay as

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.729 
have a look at how to do that okay as
you<00:02:13.099> can<00:02:13.159> see<00:02:13.250> I've<00:02:13.610> cut<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:13.909> little<00:02:14.060> bit<00:02:14.209> of<00:02:14.299> a

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
you can see I've cut a little bit of a

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.800 
you can see I've cut a little bit of a
run<00:02:15.739> in<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.579> fuselage<00:02:17.209> just<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.540> give<00:02:17.659> me

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
run in the the fuselage just to give me

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.160 
run in the the fuselage just to give me
access

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
access

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.440 
access
to<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.470> screw<00:02:18.770> that's<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.220> there<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.240> I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
to the screw that's in there so that I

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.420 
to the screw that's in there so that I
can<00:02:20.569> remove<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.560> control<00:02:21.950> arm<00:02:22.130> from<00:02:22.400> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
can remove the control arm from the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.970 
can remove the control arm from the
servo<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.090> move<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.930> back<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.500> we're<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.800> full

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
servo and move it back so we're the full

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.430 
servo and move it back so we're the full
down<00:02:25.190> position<00:02:25.400> now<00:02:25.900> what<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:26.930> want<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.170> do<00:02:27.290> is

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
down position now what I want to do is

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.160 
down position now what I want to do is
take<00:02:27.590> my<00:02:27.650> screwdriver<00:02:29.290> unscrew<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.680> servo

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
take my screwdriver unscrew the servo

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.080 
take my screwdriver unscrew the servo
it's<00:02:33.170> going<00:02:33.349> to<00:02:33.410> be<00:02:33.470> some<00:02:33.680> some<00:02:34.130> chattering<00:02:34.940> as

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
it's going to be some some chattering as

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.010 
it's going to be some some chattering as
the<00:02:35.239> servo<00:02:35.480> drive<00:02:35.870> pulls<00:02:36.140> against<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:38.020> of

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
the servo drive pulls against the of

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
the servo drive pulls against the of
what<00:02:39.440> i'm<00:02:39.530> doing<00:02:39.800> here<00:02:39.920> that's<00:02:40.190> ok<00:02:44.769> ok<00:02:45.769> now<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
what i'm doing here that's ok ok now the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.790 
what i'm doing here that's ok ok now the
screws<00:02:46.519> out<00:02:46.700> i<00:02:46.970> can<00:02:47.690> remove<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.440> servo

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
screws out i can remove the servo

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.479 
screws out i can remove the servo
control<00:02:49.220> arm<00:02:53.260> let's<00:02:54.260> set<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.530> wiggle<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:54.920> pull

control arm let's set the wiggle it pull

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.400 
control arm let's set the wiggle it pull
it<00:02:55.580> off<00:02:55.780> might<00:02:56.780> help<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.019> get<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.170> screwdriver

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
it off might help to get a screwdriver

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.740 
it off might help to get a screwdriver
under<00:02:57.799> there<00:02:58.239> now<00:02:59.239> i'm<00:02:59.450> just<00:02:59.600> going<00:02:59.720> to

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
under there now i'm just going to

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.590 
under there now i'm just going to
reposition<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:00.799> further<00:03:01.040> back<00:03:01.600> as

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
reposition it so it's further back as

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.240 
reposition it so it's further back as
far<00:03:02.780> back<00:03:02.989> as<00:03:03.049> I<00:03:03.319> can<00:03:03.350> get<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:03.799> essentially

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
far back as I can get it essentially

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.600 
far back as I can get it essentially
with<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.060> setting<00:03:05.390> here<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:07.250> push<00:03:07.459> it

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
with this the setting here and push it

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:16.479 
with this the setting here and push it
on<00:03:09.640> now<00:03:10.640> we'll<00:03:10.790> replace<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.330> screw<00:03:15.370> having<00:03:16.370> a

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
on now we'll replace the screw having a

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.100 
on now we'll replace the screw having a
magnetic<00:03:17.000> screwdriver<00:03:17.150> really<00:03:17.660> helps<00:03:17.900> for

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
magnetic screwdriver really helps for

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.289 
magnetic screwdriver really helps for
this<00:03:18.260> now<00:03:18.680> if<00:03:18.920> I<00:03:19.040> look<00:03:19.069> as<00:03:19.580> you<00:03:20.000> can<00:03:20.120> see<00:03:20.269> that

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
this now if I look as you can see that

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.210 
this now if I look as you can see that
circle<00:03:20.750> control<00:03:21.019> arm<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:23.420> has<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:25.040> full

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
circle control arm it has the full

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.080 
circle control arm it has the full
travel<00:03:25.489> without<00:03:26.299> binding<00:03:27.670> now<00:03:28.670> if<00:03:28.790> we<00:03:28.850> look<00:03:28.880> at

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
travel without binding now if we look at

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.190 
travel without binding now if we look at
the<00:03:29.350> flaps<00:03:30.350> that's<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.549> down<00:03:31.760> that's<00:03:32.540> yep<00:03:32.840> we

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
the flaps that's the down that's yep we

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.400 
the flaps that's the down that's yep we
still<00:03:33.440> have<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.890> shorten<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.660> control

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
still have to shorten the the control

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.979 
still have to shorten the the control
arm<00:03:36.650> here<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.400> push<00:03:37.579> rod<00:03:37.790> will<00:03:38.570> do<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:38.840> by

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
arm here so the push rod will do that by

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.870 
arm here so the push rod will do that by
unclipping<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.709> clevis<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.310> just

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
unclipping the clevis and just

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.599 
unclipping the clevis and just
tightening<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.590> how<00:03:42.590> we<00:03:42.650> want<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.980> do<00:03:43.160> this<00:03:43.370> is

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
tightening it how we want to do this is

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.729 
tightening it how we want to do this is
so<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.239> when<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.109> flaps<00:03:45.350> are<00:03:45.470> in<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.590> up

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
so that when the flaps are in the up

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.970 
so that when the flaps are in the up
position<00:03:45.790> they<00:03:46.790> remain<00:03:47.180> flush<00:03:47.950> with<00:03:48.950> the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
position they remain flush with the

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.440 
position they remain flush with the
trailing<00:03:49.400> edge<00:03:49.519> so<00:03:50.030> that's<00:03:50.150> we're<00:03:50.269> going<00:03:50.390> to

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
trailing edge so that's we're going to

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.270 
trailing edge so that's we're going to
do<00:03:50.570> is<00:03:50.810> we'll<00:03:50.959> just<00:03:51.140> unclip<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:51.920> tighten

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
do is we'll just unclip that and tighten

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.580 
do is we'll just unclip that and tighten
it<00:03:52.370> up<00:03:52.750> I'm<00:03:53.750> going<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:53.959> do<00:03:54.049> is<00:03:54.170> just<00:03:54.290> take<00:03:54.440> my

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
it up I'm going to do is just take my

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.310 
it up I'm going to do is just take my
screwdriver<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.480> unclip<00:03:56.480> this<00:03:59.170> right<00:04:00.170> off

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
screwdriver and unclip this right off

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.990 
screwdriver and unclip this right off
and<00:04:00.890> I'll<00:04:00.980> shorten<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.400> by<00:04:01.430> turning<00:04:01.549> it

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
and I'll shorten it by turning it

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.910 
and I'll shorten it by turning it
clockwise<00:04:02.209> and<00:04:03.140> what<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.500> want<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.739> do<00:04:03.890> is

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
clockwise and what I want to do is

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.300 
clockwise and what I want to do is
measure<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:06.549> when<00:04:07.549> the<00:04:08.380> flaps<00:04:09.380> when

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
measure it so that when the flaps when

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.729 
measure it so that when the flaps when
it's<00:04:10.850> in<00:04:11.000> this<00:04:11.150> position<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:12.319> flap<00:04:12.530> is

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
it's in this position that the flap is

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.349 
it's in this position that the flap is
neutral<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:13.130> we<00:04:13.220> have<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.459> shorten<00:04:13.700> it<00:04:13.850> us<00:04:14.030> a

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
neutral so we have to shorten it us a

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:22.950 
neutral so we have to shorten it us a
little<00:04:15.139> bit<00:04:15.290> here

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.420 

and<00:04:23.960> roughly<00:04:24.500> gauge<00:04:24.889> looks<00:04:25.130> like<00:04:25.250> neither

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
and roughly gauge looks like neither

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:34.180 
and roughly gauge looks like neither
half<00:04:25.940> turn<00:04:26.270> or<00:04:26.389> so<00:04:26.569> another<00:04:27.020> turn<00:04:32.650> now<00:04:33.650> if<00:04:34.039> you

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
half turn or so another turn now if you

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.499 
half turn or so another turn now if you
look<00:04:34.340> at<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:35.560> flap<00:04:36.669> that's<00:04:37.669> the<00:04:37.910> full<00:04:38.180> up

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
look at the flap that's the full up

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.230 
look at the flap that's the full up
position<00:04:38.569> and<00:04:39.669> that's<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.849> full<00:04:41.030> down

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
position and that's the full down

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.040 
position and that's the full down
position<00:04:41.449> which<00:04:42.440> is<00:04:42.470> what<00:04:42.770> we<00:04:42.860> want<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:44.870> can

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
position which is what we want you can

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.670 
position which is what we want you can
see<00:04:45.169> I<00:04:45.199> haven't<00:04:45.410> fixed<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.710> other<00:04:45.860> ones<00:04:46.069> yet

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
see I haven't fixed the other ones yet

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.260 
see I haven't fixed the other ones yet
and<00:04:48.680> that<00:04:48.710> gets<00:04:49.039> the<00:04:49.160> full<00:04:49.400> movement<00:04:50.000> both

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
and that gets the full movement both

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:58.450 
and that gets the full movement both
ways<00:04:51.099> and<00:04:54.099> that's<00:04:55.099> pretty<00:04:55.250> much<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:57.460> okay

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
ways and that's pretty much it okay

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.860 
ways and that's pretty much it okay
let's<00:04:58.669> just<00:04:58.819> have<00:04:58.970> a<00:04:59.000> look<00:04:59.090> and<00:04:59.419> see<00:04:59.479> how<00:04:59.810> the

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
let's just have a look and see how the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.110 
let's just have a look and see how the
flaps<00:05:00.229> work<00:05:00.560> there's<00:05:01.220> two<00:05:01.400> controls<00:05:01.849> that

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
flaps work there's two controls that

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.580 
flaps work there's two controls that
operate<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.509> flaps<00:05:02.840> we've<00:05:03.050> got<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.319> switch

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
operate the flaps we've got the switch

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.550 
operate the flaps we've got the switch
here<00:05:03.889> and<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.550> potentiometer<00:05:05.560> essentially

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
here and the potentiometer essentially

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.159 
here and the potentiometer essentially
what<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.370> switch<00:05:07.669> does<00:05:07.940> is<00:05:08.150> it<00:05:08.330> reverses<00:05:08.960> the

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
what the switch does is it reverses the

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.110 
what the switch does is it reverses the
position<00:05:09.620> of<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:10.130> whatever<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.610> flaps<00:05:10.909> are

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
position of the whatever the flaps are

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.300 
position of the whatever the flaps are
at<00:05:11.240> so<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:11.840> they're<00:05:12.110> fully<00:05:12.319> upright<00:05:12.500> now<00:05:12.889> I'm

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
at so that they're fully upright now I'm

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.189 
at so that they're fully upright now I'm
going<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.520> hit<00:05:13.639> the<00:05:13.669> switch<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.360> they're

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
going to hit the switch and they're

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.529 
going to hit the switch and they're
going<00:05:15.289> to<00:05:15.349> go<00:05:15.470> to<00:05:15.530> fully<00:05:15.800> down<00:05:16.270> switch<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:17.419> back

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
going to go to fully down switch it back

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.469 
going to go to fully down switch it back
when<00:05:18.349> they<00:05:18.470> go<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.680> fully<00:05:18.949> up<00:05:19.130> now<00:05:19.370> if<00:05:20.240> I<00:05:20.300> want

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
when they go to fully up now if I want

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.330 
when they go to fully up now if I want
to<00:05:20.509> have<00:05:20.659> some<00:05:21.380> kind<00:05:21.560> of<00:05:21.590> an<00:05:21.710> intermediate

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
to have some kind of an intermediate

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.149 
to have some kind of an intermediate
position<00:05:22.370> i<00:05:23.000> use<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.919> potentiometer<00:05:24.919> as<00:05:25.039> you

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
position i use the potentiometer as you

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.640 
position i use the potentiometer as you
can<00:05:25.250> see<00:05:25.690> that<00:05:26.690> justice<00:05:27.050> i<00:05:27.139> can<00:05:27.289> do<00:05:27.440> any

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
can see that justice i can do any

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.430 
can see that justice i can do any
position<00:05:28.310> of<00:05:28.610> flap<00:05:28.960> between<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.050> full<00:05:30.289> yet

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
position of flap between the full yet

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.430 
position of flap between the full yet
and<00:05:30.680> a<00:05:30.830> fully<00:05:31.070> down<00:05:31.310> position<00:05:31.900> if<00:05:32.900> i<00:05:33.139> hit<00:05:33.259> the

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
and a fully down position if i hit the

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.709 
and a fully down position if i hit the
switch<00:05:33.650> again<00:05:33.969> it'll<00:05:34.969> reverse<00:05:35.150> position<00:05:35.360> to

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719 
switch again it'll reverse position to

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.080 
switch again it'll reverse position to
come<00:05:35.960> back<00:05:36.139> up<00:05:36.380> so<00:05:37.310> if<00:05:37.520> i<00:05:37.610> go<00:05:37.639> to<00:05:37.789> like<00:05:38.000> a

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
come back up so if i go to like a

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.469 
come back up so if i go to like a
halfway<00:05:38.330> position<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:40.789> i<00:05:40.880> hit<00:05:41.000> the<00:05:41.030> slaps

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
halfway position and i hit the slaps

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.589 
halfway position and i hit the slaps
nothing<00:05:42.289> happens<00:05:42.710> so<00:05:43.460> it<00:05:43.580> has<00:05:43.699> to<00:05:43.729> make<00:05:44.479> sure

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
nothing happens so it has to make sure

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:45.670 
nothing happens so it has to make sure
that<00:05:44.750> you<00:05:44.900> if<00:05:45.139> you're<00:05:45.289> going<00:05:45.409> to<00:05:45.500> do<00:05:45.560> an

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
that you if you're going to do an

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.020 
that you if you're going to do an
intermediate<00:05:46.099> position<00:05:46.130> that<00:05:46.550> you<00:05:46.639> have<00:05:46.880> to

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
intermediate position that you have to

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.930 
intermediate position that you have to
roll<00:05:47.210> it<00:05:47.270> back<00:05:47.509> go<00:05:48.080> away<00:05:48.319> to<00:05:49.159> switch<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.669> flaps

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
roll it back go away to switch the flaps

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.620 
roll it back go away to switch the flaps
all<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.389> way<00:05:50.509> back<00:05:50.719> up<00:05:51.250> here's<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.880> setup<00:05:53.389> of

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
all the way back up here's the setup of

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.629 
all the way back up here's the setup of
the<00:05:53.780> main<00:05:53.990> landing<00:05:54.409> gear<00:05:54.440> as<00:05:54.770> you<00:05:55.280> can<00:05:55.400> see

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
the main landing gear as you can see

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:57.790 
the main landing gear as you can see
it's<00:05:55.940> got<00:05:56.060> three<00:05:56.300> parts<00:05:56.599> we've<00:05:56.719> got<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.110> wire

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
it's got three parts we've got the wire

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.450 
it's got three parts we've got the wire
landing<00:05:58.159> gear<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:58.969> screws<00:05:59.389> and<00:05:59.750> there's<00:06:00.199> a

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
landing gear the screws and there's a

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.159 
landing gear the screws and there's a
clear<00:06:01.460> plastic<00:06:01.940> piece<00:06:02.449> that<00:06:02.659> you<00:06:02.690> can<00:06:02.960> see

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
clear plastic piece that you can see

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.409 
clear plastic piece that you can see
there<00:06:03.550> that's<00:06:04.550> essentially<00:06:04.969> how<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:05.120> goes<00:06:05.240> up

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
there that's essentially how it goes up

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.580 
there that's essentially how it goes up
with<00:06:05.539> the<00:06:05.659> the<00:06:05.930> metal<00:06:06.139> landing<00:06:06.380> gear<00:06:06.500> down

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
with the the metal landing gear down

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.350 
with the the metal landing gear down
first<00:06:06.919> the<00:06:07.099> clear<00:06:07.310> plastic<00:06:07.430> piece<00:06:07.909> over<00:06:08.150> top

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
first the clear plastic piece over top

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.779 
first the clear plastic piece over top
and<00:06:08.569> then<00:06:09.110> screw<00:06:09.469> it<00:06:09.500> in<00:06:09.620> place<00:06:09.650> one<00:06:10.639> thing<00:06:10.759> I

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
and then screw it in place one thing I

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.129 
and then screw it in place one thing I
want<00:06:10.909> to<00:06:10.940> make<00:06:11.060> sure<00:06:11.090> is<00:06:11.389> that<00:06:11.419> the<00:06:11.659> alignment

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
want to make sure is that the alignment

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.020 
want to make sure is that the alignment
is<00:06:12.199> the<00:06:12.349> same<00:06:12.590> so<00:06:12.889> this<00:06:13.069> is<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:13.400> rear<00:06:13.669> of<00:06:13.699> the

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
is the same so this is the rear of the

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.309 
is the same so this is the rear of the
fuselage<00:06:14.449> and<00:06:14.599> this<00:06:14.719> is<00:06:14.840> the<00:06:14.960> front<00:06:15.169> of<00:06:15.199> the

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
fuselage and this is the front of the

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.260 
fuselage and this is the front of the
fuselage<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:15.919> the<00:06:15.979> landing<00:06:16.639> gear<00:06:16.819> wheel

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
fuselage and the landing gear wheel

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.610 
fuselage and the landing gear wheel
should<00:06:17.509> come<00:06:17.719> out<00:06:17.840> at<00:06:17.990> the<00:06:18.110> back<00:06:18.289> of<00:06:18.590> that

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
should come out at the back of that

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.149 
should come out at the back of that
otherwise<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:20.120> the<00:06:20.960> nose<00:06:21.259> gear<00:06:21.289> won't<00:06:21.949> hit

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159 
otherwise the the nose gear won't hit

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:23.620 
otherwise the the nose gear won't hit
the<00:06:22.190> touch<00:06:22.550> the<00:06:22.669> ground<00:06:22.789> the<00:06:23.000> tail<00:06:23.180> alarms

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
the touch the ground the tail alarms

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.279 
the touch the ground the tail alarms
touchdown<00:06:23.990> essentially<00:06:24.440> by<00:06:24.650> a<00:06:25.190> taildragger

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
touchdown essentially by a taildragger

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.350 
touchdown essentially by a taildragger
then<00:06:27.289> this<00:06:27.800> piece<00:06:28.250> the<00:06:28.490> foam<00:06:28.669> piece<00:06:28.880> just<00:06:29.150> fits

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
then this piece the foam piece just fits

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.839 
then this piece the foam piece just fits
over<00:06:29.449> top<00:06:29.570> and<00:06:30.190> you<00:06:31.190> might<00:06:31.339> want<00:06:31.430> to<00:06:31.580> tape<00:06:31.729> it

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849 
over top and you might want to tape it

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:32.970 
over top and you might want to tape it
in<00:06:31.940> place<00:06:32.000> so<00:06:32.330> it<00:06:32.419> doesn't<00:06:32.449> come<00:06:32.810> out

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
in place so it doesn't come out

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.560 
in place so it doesn't come out
if<00:06:33.310> it's<00:06:33.490> pretty<00:06:33.670> snugly<00:06:34.030> you<00:06:34.120> might<00:06:34.300> want<00:06:34.450> to

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
if it's pretty snugly you might want to

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.610 
if it's pretty snugly you might want to
take<00:06:34.690> in<00:06:34.840> a<00:06:34.870> place<00:06:35.050> anyways<00:06:37.170> okay<00:06:38.170> so<00:06:38.260> the<00:06:38.470> nose

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
take in a place anyways okay so the nose

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.200 
take in a place anyways okay so the nose
gear<00:06:38.650> setup<00:06:39.100> is<00:06:39.310> pretty<00:06:39.490> straightforward<00:06:39.820> as

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
gear setup is pretty straightforward as

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.080 
gear setup is pretty straightforward as
well<00:06:40.450> you're<00:06:41.050> looking<00:06:41.290> at<00:06:41.760> essentially<00:06:42.760> two

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
well you're looking at essentially two

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.700 
well you're looking at essentially two
pieces<00:06:43.480> that<00:06:43.630> hook<00:06:43.750> up<00:06:43.930> to<00:06:44.050> the<00:06:44.140> clevis<00:06:44.380> here

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
pieces that hook up to the clevis here

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.490 
pieces that hook up to the clevis here
the<00:06:45.370> the<00:06:45.880> plastic<00:06:46.300> piece<00:06:46.510> that<00:06:46.720> mounts<00:06:47.050> into

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
the the plastic piece that mounts into

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.740 
the the plastic piece that mounts into
the<00:06:47.830> the<00:06:48.190> firewall<00:06:48.670> and<00:06:48.910> that<00:06:49.330> just<00:06:49.540> snaps

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
the the firewall and that just snaps

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.480 
the the firewall and that just snaps
into<00:06:49.930> place<00:06:49.990> and<00:06:50.380> then<00:06:50.890> there's<00:06:51.070> some<00:06:51.220> metal

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
into place and then there's some metal

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.850 
into place and then there's some metal
leg<00:06:51.670> that<00:06:51.910> screws<00:06:52.390> into<00:06:52.420> it<00:06:52.960> I<00:06:53.140> was<00:06:53.650> going<00:06:53.800> to

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
leg that screws into it I was going to

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.110 
leg that screws into it I was going to
zoom<00:06:53.980> in<00:06:54.100> a<00:06:54.160> little<00:06:54.250> bit<00:06:54.400> to<00:06:54.610> show<00:06:54.820> you<00:06:54.970> the

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
zoom in a little bit to show you the

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.410 
zoom in a little bit to show you the
detail<00:06:56.130> essentially<00:06:57.130> you<00:06:57.820> can<00:06:57.850> see<00:06:58.150> that<00:06:58.300> the

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
detail essentially you can see that the

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.230 
detail essentially you can see that the
arm<00:06:58.750> is<00:06:59.020> the<00:06:59.650> clip<00:06:59.860> is<00:06:59.890> just<00:07:00.190> snaps<00:07:00.970> into<00:07:01.150> a

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
arm is the clip is just snaps into a

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.240 
arm is the clip is just snaps into a
spot<00:07:01.630> and<00:07:01.810> it<00:07:02.320> comes<00:07:02.530> on<00:07:02.650> at<00:07:02.770> a<00:07:02.860> weird<00:07:03.040> angle

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
spot and it comes on at a weird angle

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.790 
spot and it comes on at a weird angle
the<00:07:03.520> 45<00:07:03.910> degree<00:07:04.030> angle<00:07:04.420> like<00:07:04.540> that<00:07:04.750> and<00:07:05.680> the

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
the 45 degree angle like that and the

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.850 
the 45 degree angle like that and the
steering<00:07:06.150> takes<00:07:07.150> place<00:07:07.390> like<00:07:07.600> that<00:07:07.710> okay<00:07:08.710> and

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860 
steering takes place like that okay and

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.280 
steering takes place like that okay and
you<00:07:08.980> see<00:07:09.160> the<00:07:09.250> nose<00:07:09.400> we<00:07:09.640> will<00:07:10.270> move<00:07:10.450> with<00:07:10.630> it<00:07:10.660> it

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.290 
you see the nose we will move with it it

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.080 
you see the nose we will move with it it
looks<00:07:11.500> like<00:07:11.560> i<00:07:11.680> said<00:07:11.770> the<00:07:12.310> angles<00:07:12.790> not<00:07:12.940> going

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
looks like i said the angles not going

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.320 
looks like i said the angles not going
to<00:07:13.150> work<00:07:13.240> very<00:07:13.480> well<00:07:13.510> but<00:07:14.470> it<00:07:14.920> does<00:07:15.300> it<00:07:16.300> just

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
to work very well but it does it just

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.870 
to work very well but it does it just
seems<00:07:16.660> strange<00:07:16.920> once<00:07:17.920> you've<00:07:18.130> got<00:07:18.400> everything

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 
seems strange once you've got everything

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.670 
seems strange once you've got everything
straightened<00:07:19.390> out<00:07:19.480> as<00:07:19.630> far<00:07:19.810> as<00:07:19.900> the<00:07:20.110> the

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 
straightened out as far as the the

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.200 
straightened out as far as the the
rudder<00:07:20.890> is<00:07:21.010> concerned<00:07:21.430> you<00:07:21.640> can<00:07:22.060> actually

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210 
rudder is concerned you can actually

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.860 
rudder is concerned you can actually
twist<00:07:22.780> the<00:07:23.170> nose<00:07:23.620> wheel<00:07:23.890> in<00:07:24.130> the<00:07:24.880> plastic<00:07:25.420> to

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870 
twist the nose wheel in the plastic to

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.330 
twist the nose wheel in the plastic to
straighten<00:07:26.230> it<00:07:26.290> out<00:07:26.410> and<00:07:26.620> that's<00:07:27.010> all<00:07:27.250> you

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:27.340 
straighten it out and that's all you

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.360 
straighten it out and that's all you
have<00:07:27.490> to<00:07:27.610> do<00:07:27.790> and<00:07:28.530> if<00:07:29.530> you<00:07:29.620> look<00:07:29.800> at<00:07:29.920> this<00:07:30.040> snap

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.370 
have to do and if you look at this snap

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.400 
have to do and if you look at this snap
you<00:07:30.610> can<00:07:30.730> actually<00:07:30.880> see<00:07:31.090> where<00:07:31.870> it<00:07:31.960> snaps<00:07:32.230> into

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:32.410 
you can actually see where it snaps into

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.130 
you can actually see where it snaps into
place<00:07:32.730> right<00:07:33.730> here<00:07:33.760> and<00:07:34.210> right<00:07:34.270> there<00:07:34.450> you

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:35.140 
place right here and right there you

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.530 
place right here and right there you
have<00:07:35.260> to<00:07:35.320> push<00:07:35.560> it<00:07:35.590> essentially<00:07:36.070> yeah<00:07:36.310> it<00:07:37.270> this

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:37.540 
have to push it essentially yeah it this

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.730 
have to push it essentially yeah it this
doesn't<00:07:37.660> actually<00:07:37.900> snap<00:07:38.260> in<00:07:38.440> the<00:07:38.500> top<00:07:38.710> the

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:38.740 
doesn't actually snap in the top the

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.010 
doesn't actually snap in the top the
snaps<00:07:39.190> at<00:07:39.370> the<00:07:39.460> bottom<00:07:39.760> so<00:07:40.210> you<00:07:40.240> have<00:07:40.360> to<00:07:40.450> sort

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.020 
snaps at the bottom so you have to sort

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.900 
snaps at the bottom so you have to sort
of<00:07:41.140> place<00:07:41.320> it<00:07:41.470> in<00:07:41.560> the<00:07:41.590> top<00:07:41.920> and<00:07:42.160> then<00:07:42.580> snap<00:07:42.850> the

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:42.910 
of place it in the top and then snap the

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.030 
of place it in the top and then snap the
bottom<00:07:43.390> to<00:07:43.870> install<00:07:44.230> it<00:07:44.380> other<00:07:44.830> than<00:07:44.980> that

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.040 
bottom to install it other than that

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.330 
bottom to install it other than that
it's<00:07:45.340> pretty<00:07:45.760> straightforward
