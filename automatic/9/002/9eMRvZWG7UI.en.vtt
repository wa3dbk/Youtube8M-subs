update<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> clean<00:01:12.030> jar

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299

you can just get a clean jar and then

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.510

world it's gonna be all pretty it's
gonna<00:04:13.120> have<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.630> shaders<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:15.340> water<00:04:15.580> is

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
gonna have the shaders the water is

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.600 
gonna have the shaders the water is
gonna<00:04:15.910> look<00:04:16.030> all<00:04:16.209> nice<00:04:18.360> maybe<00:04:19.360> I<00:04:20.400> don't<00:04:21.400> know

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
gonna look all nice maybe I don't know

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.600 
gonna look all nice maybe I don't know
what's<00:04:21.850> happening<00:04:22.180> but<00:04:22.390> normally<00:04:23.280> yeah<00:04:24.280> so

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
what's happening but normally yeah so

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.970 
what's happening but normally yeah so
that's<00:04:25.510> how<00:04:25.660> you<00:04:25.720> do<00:04:25.900> it<00:04:25.930> there's<00:04:26.410> multiple

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
that's how you do it there's multiple

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.550 
that's how you do it there's multiple
there's<00:04:27.640> also<00:04:27.790> different<00:04:28.200> shaders<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.350> don't

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
there's also different shaders I don't

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.410 
there's also different shaders I don't
remember<00:04:29.980> where<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.250> got<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:30.610> one<00:04:30.850> but<00:04:31.150> I've

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
remember where it got this one but I've

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.150 
remember where it got this one but I've
got<00:04:31.690> this<00:04:31.870> cell<00:04:32.320> shaders<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:32.830> kind<00:04:32.980> of<00:04:33.010> looks

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
got this cell shaders it kind of looks

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.780 
got this cell shaders it kind of looks
like<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.370> Borderlands<00:04:33.940> kind<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:34.180> feel<00:04:34.500> but<00:04:35.500> a

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
like a Borderlands kind of feel but a

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.390 
like a Borderlands kind of feel but a
shaders<00:04:36.790> mod<00:04:36.820> isn't<00:04:37.420> not<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:38.170> mod<00:04:38.770> that<00:04:38.800> most

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
shaders mod isn't not a mod that most

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.010 
shaders mod isn't not a mod that most
people<00:04:39.730> can<00:04:39.850> run<00:04:40.030> it's<00:04:40.210> pretty<00:04:40.510> difficult<00:04:40.720> to

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
people can run it's pretty difficult to

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.050 
people can run it's pretty difficult to
run<00:04:41.170> so<00:04:41.440> if<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:41.950> don't<00:04:42.130> have<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.340> super<00:04:42.910> nice

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
run so if you don't have a super nice

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.630 
run so if you don't have a super nice
computer<00:04:43.390> then<00:04:44.260> I<00:04:44.560> don't<00:04:45.010> recommend<00:04:45.310> you

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
computer then I don't recommend you

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.340 
computer then I don't recommend you
trying<00:04:46.060> this<00:04:46.270> because<00:04:46.510> it'll<00:04:46.690> just<00:04:46.810> end<00:04:46.960> up<00:04:47.170> in

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
trying this because it'll just end up in

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.060 
trying this because it'll just end up in
you<00:04:48.070> either<00:04:48.220> crashing<00:04:49.060> or<00:04:49.560> not<00:04:50.560> being<00:04:50.740> able<00:04:50.890> to

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
you either crashing or not being able to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.740 
you either crashing or not being able to
run<00:04:51.250> it<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.490> mean<00:04:51.610> even<00:04:51.790> on<00:04:52.000> half<00:04:52.300> screen<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:52.720> can

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
run it I mean even on half screen I can

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.410 
run it I mean even on half screen I can
run<00:04:53.050> it<00:04:53.140> fine<00:04:53.350> but<00:04:53.590> if<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:53.770> go<00:04:53.800> into<00:04:54.010> full<00:04:54.250> screen

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
run it fine but if I go into full screen

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.190 
run it fine but if I go into full screen
it<00:04:55.420> runs<00:04:56.230> pretty<00:04:56.470> slow<00:04:56.890> and<00:04:57.870> especially<00:04:58.870> this

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
it runs pretty slow and especially this

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.520 
it runs pretty slow and especially this
is<00:04:59.350> a<00:04:59.380> shaders<00:04:59.920> mod<00:04:59.950> or<00:05:00.400> this<00:05:01.090> one<00:05:01.300> is

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
is a shaders mod or this one is

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.450 
is a shaders mod or this one is
extremely<00:05:02.530> slow<00:05:02.770> when<00:05:02.950> it<00:05:03.040> comes<00:05:03.190> to<00:05:03.310> full

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
extremely slow when it comes to full

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.490 
extremely slow when it comes to full
screen<00:05:03.640> for<00:05:03.910> me<00:05:04.090> but<00:05:04.780> that's<00:05:04.900> just<00:05:05.050> if<00:05:05.320> you've

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
screen for me but that's just if you've

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.870 
screen for me but that's just if you've
got<00:05:05.620> a<00:05:05.650> better<00:05:05.770> computer<00:05:06.130> you'll<00:05:06.490> be<00:05:06.610> able<00:05:06.700> to

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
got a better computer you'll be able to

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.670 
got a better computer you'll be able to
run<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:09.390> yeah<00:05:10.390> so<00:05:11.200> if<00:05:11.290> you've<00:05:11.410> got<00:05:11.500> any

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
run it and yeah so if you've got any

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.360 
run it and yeah so if you've got any
questions<00:05:11.890> about<00:05:12.700> what<00:05:13.200> fed<00:05:14.200> in<00:05:14.350> doodoo<00:05:15.130> good

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
questions about what fed in doodoo good

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.180 
questions about what fed in doodoo good
if<00:05:15.640> they're<00:05:15.940> not<00:05:16.210> too<00:05:16.270> good<00:05:16.690> but<00:05:16.720> if<00:05:17.410> something

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
if they're not too good but if something

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.420 
if they're not too good but if something
wasn't<00:05:18.460> clear<00:05:18.790> enough<00:05:19.000> in<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:20.290> video<00:05:20.500> just

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
could do anything about it and you know

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.110 
could do anything about it and you know
this<00:05:32.050> is<00:05:32.260> this<00:05:33.160> is<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.430> shaders<00:05:33.760> mod<00:05:33.790> it's

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
this is this is the shaders mod it's

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.600 
this is this is the shaders mod it's
pretty<00:05:35.020> it's<00:05:35.110> a<00:05:35.200> really<00:05:35.410> nice<00:05:35.590> mod<00:05:35.860> it's<00:05:36.130> it

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
pretty it's a really nice mod it's it

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.940 
pretty it's a really nice mod it's it
makes<00:05:36.790> the<00:05:37.060> game<00:05:37.240> much<00:05:37.480> much<00:05:38.440> more<00:05:38.560> realistic

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
makes the game much much more realistic

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.850 
makes the game much much more realistic
I<00:05:39.370> mean<00:05:39.520> as<00:05:40.060> realistic<00:05:40.390> as<00:05:40.630> blocks<00:05:41.290> can<00:05:41.650> get<00:05:41.860> so

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
I mean as realistic as blocks can get so

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.320 
I mean as realistic as blocks can get so
