we<00:02:33.390> also<00:02:33.659> have<00:02:34.049> some<00:02:34.409> different<00:02:35.220> options<00:02:35.430> are

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
we also have some different options are

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.809 
we also have some different options are
right<00:02:36.629> here<00:02:36.870> below<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> filters<00:02:37.620> tab<00:02:37.860> we<00:02:38.790> can

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
right here below the filters tab we can

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.660 
right here below the filters tab we can
change<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.720> strength<00:02:40.079> so<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:41.190> i<00:02:41.310> were<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.519> put

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
change the strength so if i were to put

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940 
change the strength so if i were to put
the<00:02:41.790> strength<00:02:42.090> very<00:02:42.810> low<00:02:43.049> as<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.769> see

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the strength very low as you can see

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.220 
the strength very low as you can see
there's<00:02:44.129> not<00:02:44.280> much<00:02:44.430> water<00:02:44.670> color<00:02:45.030> but<00:02:45.989> we<00:02:46.109> can

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
there's not much water color but we can

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.559 
there's not much water color but we can
also<00:02:46.379> drag<00:02:46.829> it<00:02:47.010> back<00:02:47.159> up<00:02:47.340> again<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.359> water

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
also drag it back up again and the water

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.390 
also drag it back up again and the water
color<00:02:48.810> will<00:02:49.019> be<00:02:49.049> high<00:02:49.739> again<00:02:50.010> we<00:02:50.129> can<00:02:50.280> also

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
color will be high again we can also

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.839 
color will be high again we can also
change<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.909> details<00:02:52.040> just<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.340> more<00:02:53.370> TP

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
change the details just to have more TP

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.479 
change the details just to have more TP
a--<00:02:54.030> detail<00:02:54.599> or<00:02:54.840> less<00:02:55.049> detail<00:02:55.489> saturation

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
a-- detail or less detail saturation

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.129 
a-- detail or less detail saturation
brightness<00:02:56.970> I'll<00:02:57.629> that's<00:02:57.840> pretty

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
brightness I'll that's pretty

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.280 
brightness I'll that's pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:59.209> then<00:03:00.209> we<00:03:00.329> have<00:03:00.540> some

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
self-explanatory then we have some

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.660 
self-explanatory then we have some
different<00:03:01.709> pencils<00:03:02.190> now<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.639> do<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:03.139> dark

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
different pencils now we can do a dark

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.030 
different pencils now we can do a dark
shading<00:03:05.670> we<00:03:05.849> can<00:03:06.000> have<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> contour<00:03:06.889> we<00:03:07.889> can

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
shading we can have a contour we can

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.220 
shading we can have a contour we can
have<00:03:08.220> light<00:03:08.609> shading<00:03:09.000> i<00:03:09.389> will<00:03:09.959> try<00:03:10.170> this

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
have light shading i will try this

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.580 
have light shading i will try this
contour<00:03:10.829> one<00:03:11.129> will<00:03:11.730> hit<00:03:11.849> process<00:03:12.359> and<00:03:12.750> as<00:03:13.500> you

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
contour one will hit process and as you

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.979 
contour one will hit process and as you
can<00:03:13.709> see<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:14.010> adds<00:03:14.159> just<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.840> different<00:03:15.840> look

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
can see it adds just a different look

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.979 
can see it adds just a different look
they're<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.560> bit<00:03:17.010> darker<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:18.510> that's<00:03:18.629> very<00:03:18.840> nice

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
they're a bit darker so that's very nice

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.349 
they're a bit darker so that's very nice
we<00:03:19.139> can<00:03:19.290> also<00:03:19.410> change<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.889> type<00:03:20.129> of<00:03:20.160> canvas<00:03:20.790> so

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
we can also change the type of canvas so

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.720 
we can also change the type of canvas so
we<00:03:21.480> can<00:03:21.599> add<00:03:21.750> such<00:03:22.139> as<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.319> grained<00:03:22.739> canvas<00:03:23.400> i'll

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
we can add such as a grained canvas i'll

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.050 
we can add such as a grained canvas i'll
hit<00:03:24.269> process<00:03:24.780> as<00:03:25.349> you<00:03:25.530> can<00:03:25.620> see<00:03:25.889> it<00:03:26.069> just<00:03:26.280> has<00:03:27.030> a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
hit process as you can see it just has a

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.250 
hit process as you can see it just has a
grainy<00:03:27.540> background<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.540> another<00:03:30.540> nice<00:03:30.989> one

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
grainy background to it another nice one

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.680 
grainy background to it another nice one
is<00:03:31.530> i<00:03:31.980> think<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:32.669> was<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.970> watercolor<00:03:33.449> paper

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
is i think it was the watercolor paper

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.159 
is i think it was the watercolor paper
that<00:03:34.290> kind<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.560> matches<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:35.220> quite<00:03:36.150> well<00:03:36.329> so<00:03:37.049> as

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
that kind of matches it quite well so as

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.780 
that kind of matches it quite well so as
you<00:03:37.260> can<00:03:37.379> see<00:03:37.530> right<00:03:37.560> there<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.549> that's<00:03:38.699> a<00:03:38.760> very

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
you can see right there so that's a very

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.839 
you can see right there so that's a very
very<00:03:39.449> nice<00:03:39.780> application<00:03:40.500> um<00:03:40.769> i<00:03:41.250> definitely

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
very nice application um i definitely

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.309 
very nice application um i definitely
recommend<00:03:42.000> getting<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.780> if<00:03:42.959> you're<00:03:43.109> into
