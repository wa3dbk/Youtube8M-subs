00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.080
 one goal and in the lead we must 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:26.259
 give but like this we will not allow 3 species 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.660
 rasulev apron all these kinds of dakgalbi 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.359
 today play without easy to necessary 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.489
 who got sick 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.560
 wanted to play even come new doctors 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:42.460
 they were forbidden that health again but 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:46.510
 despite the fact that between the same she win 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.019
 was also hard and thanks for the compliment 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.559
 our team because not only 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.469
 stand against such a link from the first 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.690
 Magnitogorsk link to play so much 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.699
 quality even at the end of the game when 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.300
 there was already a danger 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:11.100
 concentrated there from yarkin blend 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:15.280
 cries were not allowed practically there 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.390
 some big moment or such 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.000
 such but thanks too lars and because 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.880
 during the whole game kept us 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.100
 And in the evenings, too many moments super 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.750
 of course ill expect he expected 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:38.950
 on Tuesday he also played with the temperature 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:45.119
 the last game but also doctors recommend 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.119
 just so he can rest so he won't give up 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.320
 but you can’t usually take Ninka 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.909
 do many coaches just cops something 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.590
 hand over 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:04.110
 I look at the players Lyceum as if 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.960
 if there is enough enough 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.640
 the place is enough space so I'd better 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:15.150
 but there is a coach in front 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:20.959
 us purpose so it was 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.959
 suddenly I did n't know yesterday morning and 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.110
 The first big 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.150
 team responsibility for the results 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.580
 there are many fans 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.580
 comes this profession will have 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.570
 Ivan as they said goodbye to Alexander 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.840
 Something man transfer is not normal 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.000
 because friends stayed before today 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.210
 Here was the first match come last 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.780
 will be in the role of head coach I would be here 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.880
 Minsk and then was all the time 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.420
 practically slovaks like how 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.420
 assistant a little later I started to sing 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.500
 big difference after all 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.980
 forgotten some feeling no no no and 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.959
 total weight and if then do do 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.670
 coaching defenders as I did in the past 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.860
 season is all when 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.530
 very similar as it is considered what is not 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:28.060
 had enough team to win before so 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.340
 say something even changed me 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.250
 It seems today, too, to change finally 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:38.530
 because breath you play but 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.260
 maybe it sounds like this 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.760
 such a phrase but there is also an important one 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.590
 luck in sports and then the same 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.840
 team play differently and for a little bit 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.340
 before yawning 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.650
 understand and because to past 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.100
 games, too, somehow, the lamprey feet hero 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.110
 plays well and immediately wandered me and 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.970
 because it hit the bar twice 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:07.269
 on the opponent scored fuck too 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.989
 but we are even ranks well now it is in this 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.810
 championship 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.630
 the most important now is already there 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.320
 good recovery me everything all 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.750
 do in order to prepare 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.370
 just said about luck and also 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.760
 mentioned that the team did not have much 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.770
 I see 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.980
 bar crossbar how do you rate 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.110
 follow this morale by that 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.700
 mom third period match salavat on 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.720
 Friday it seemed that some 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.490
 extinct players 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:40.150
 rolled well, too, completely different team 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.330
 plays if there is an account 1 1 2 1 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.620
 than if this is already the 318 opponent too 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.980
 also plays this ru 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:52.150
 but I also have to say that if we don’t 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.950
 we will do everything most and do 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.360
 correct what you need to carry 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.020
 it is necessary that I also did greatness 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.180
 pouring 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.500
 then prejudice kills too 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:08.290
 like that is not a number for me 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:14.710
 what are you planning to change the date when 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:18.010
 Valery's team so that each coach 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.500
 have its what that first of all too 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.510
 training is that this whole process is not 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.470
 just i will do 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.860
 a little bit then let's say a little bit 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.710
 more specific moment 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:37.330
 workout training process 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.560
 all that concerns recovery too 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.350
 also who is training too 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.750
 training process to have your rolls 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.950
 recovery but all that is possible 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.730
 use spilled out 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:53.290
 the players themselves are pleasantly surprised about you 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:58.190
 principle 5 principle i don't want to talk 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:06:02.810
 specifically but very well today 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:07.520
 acted corners our defenders together 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.110
 together with our center when i do us a 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.800
 paris drops the same moment but not 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:16.120
 allowed 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.120
 so much as you can say so
