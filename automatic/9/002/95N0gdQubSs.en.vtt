00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
of other models high-end models I think

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.110 
of other models high-end models I think
they<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.399> samsung<00:00:41.399> galaxy<00:00:41.430> s4

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
they have one for the samsung galaxy s4

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.040 
they have one for the samsung galaxy s4
and<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.930> believe<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:44.160> HTC<00:00:44.760> One<00:00:45.000> don't<00:00:45.510> quote<00:00:45.930> me

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and I believe the HTC One don't quote me

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.880 
and I believe the HTC One don't quote me
on<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.690> go<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.079> basically

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
on that one so here we go so basically

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.760 
on that one so here we go so basically
the<00:00:50.399> case<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:53.840> polycarbonate<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.989> TPU

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the case is polycarbonate and TPU

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.139 
the case is polycarbonate and TPU
plastic<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> two-piece<00:00:58.140> case<00:00:59.149> this

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
plastic so it is a two-piece case this

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.759 
plastic so it is a two-piece case this
front<00:01:00.809> piece<00:01:01.020> comes<00:01:01.410> out<00:01:01.820> of<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.059> more

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
front piece comes out of the more

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.969 
front piece comes out of the more
rubberized<00:01:04.999> outer<00:01:05.999> shell<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.959> that's<00:01:07.829> how

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
rubberized outer shell and that's how

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.949 
rubberized outer shell and that's how
you<00:01:08.069> actually<00:01:08.279> get<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.609> phone<00:01:08.819> into<00:01:09.179> it<00:01:09.359> so

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:09.959 
you actually get the phone into it so

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:12.019

responsive I did notice a little bit of
a<00:02:02.899> rising<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.319> part<00:02:04.649> out<00:02:04.919> of<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.369> case<00:02:05.579> at

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
a rising of this part out of the case at

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.039 
a rising of this part out of the case at
some<00:02:06.090> point<00:02:06.359> you<00:02:06.450> could<00:02:06.539> actually<00:02:06.659> feel<00:02:07.020> it

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
some point you could actually feel it

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.509 
some point you could actually feel it
moving<00:02:07.619> back<00:02:07.919> and<00:02:08.099> forth<00:02:09.019> that<00:02:10.019> might<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> an

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
moving back and forth that might be a an

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.040 
moving back and forth that might be a an
issue<00:02:11.730> with

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
issue with

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.710

if that fixes it other than that I was

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.290 
if that fixes it other than that I was
thinking<00:02:19.170> about<00:02:19.230> maybe<00:02:19.410> taking<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:20.300> plastic

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
thinking about maybe taking this plastic

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.790 
thinking about maybe taking this plastic
screen<00:02:22.110> off<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:23.070> applying<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:24.800> static

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
screen off and just applying a static

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.460 
screen off and just applying a static
screen<00:02:26.550> protector<00:02:27.150> on<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.600> phone<00:02:27.780> itself<00:02:28.170> and

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
screen protector on the phone itself and

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.270 
screen protector on the phone itself and
then<00:02:30.020> putting<00:02:31.020> this<00:02:31.260> around<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.830> phone<00:02:32.010> which

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
then putting this around the phone which

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.490 
then putting this around the phone which
allows<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.910> fit<00:02:33.120> inside<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.510> case<00:02:33.870> it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
allows it to fit inside the case it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.830 
allows it to fit inside the case it
actually<00:02:34.770> has<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.890> slight<00:02:35.190> lip<00:02:35.520> as<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.660> see

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
actually has a slight lip as you can see

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.230 
actually has a slight lip as you can see
here<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:38.870> allows<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.490> keep<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.670> phone<00:02:41.880> in

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
here that allows it to keep the phone in

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.280 
here that allows it to keep the phone in
this<00:02:42.570> frame<00:02:43.640> so<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:45.000> will<00:02:45.630> go<00:02:45.930> ahead<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.170> put

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
this frame so I will go ahead and put

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.140 
this frame so I will go ahead and put
that<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.560> there<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.130> show<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.000> really

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
that in there and show you really

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.760 
that in there and show you really
quickly<00:02:48.390> how<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.660> do<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.440> guess<00:02:49.620> this

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
quickly how to do that so I guess this

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.640 
quickly how to do that so I guess this
is<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.920> review<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.580> an<00:02:50.730> install<00:02:51.120> video<00:02:51.720> so

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
is a review and an install video so

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.800 
is a review and an install video so
basically<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.160> take<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.570> screen<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.750> you

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
basically you take the screen and you

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.880 
basically you take the screen and you
know<00:02:54.930> where<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.170> top<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.380> because<00:02:55.710> it<00:02:55.770> has<00:02:55.860> a

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
know where the top is because it has a

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.120 
know where the top is because it has a
hole<00:02:56.160> for<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:59.270> speaker<00:03:00.270> grille<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:02.040> of

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
hole for the speaker grille and of

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.080 
hole for the speaker grille and of
course<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.430> would<00:03:02.520> want<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.730> clean<00:03:02.970> your

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
course you would want to clean your

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:14.150 
course you would want to clean your
phone<00:03:03.300> off<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> little<00:03:03.900> bit<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:13.080> then<00:03:13.350> just<00:03:14.070> go

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
phone off a little bit and then just go

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.980 
phone off a little bit and then just go
ahead<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.370> slip<00:03:14.520> it<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:14.730> there<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:15.960> just

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
ahead and slip it in there so it just

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.270 
ahead and slip it in there so it just
pops<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.530> end<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.740> very<00:03:16.920> simple<00:03:18.500> it's<00:03:19.500> open

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
pops the end it's very simple it's open

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.030 
pops the end it's very simple it's open
at<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.459> top<00:03:20.730> there<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.780> pops<00:03:22.020> right<00:03:22.200> on<00:03:22.260> so

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
at the top there just pops right on so

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.370 
at the top there just pops right on so
you<00:03:23.130> have<00:03:23.280> openings<00:03:23.760> for<00:03:24.030> your<00:03:24.270> volume<00:03:25.140> rocker

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
you have openings for your volume rocker

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.280 
you have openings for your volume rocker
and<00:03:25.560> your<00:03:25.980> power<00:03:26.190> button<00:03:26.820> on<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.090> side<00:03:27.290> along

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
and your power button on this side along

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.020 
and your power button on this side along
with<00:03:28.500> as<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.709> can<00:03:28.830> see<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.250> speaker<00:03:29.700> grille

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
with as you can see the speaker grille

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.970 
with as you can see the speaker grille
now<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.600> front<00:03:30.930> facing<00:03:31.230> camera<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.590> behind

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
now the front facing camera is behind

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.390 
now the front facing camera is behind
this<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.520> the<00:03:33.110> screen<00:03:34.110> but<00:03:35.040> that's<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.310> way

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
this this the screen but that's the way

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.250 
this this the screen but that's the way
it<00:03:35.489> would<00:03:35.580> be<00:03:35.640> if<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.270> had<00:03:36.450> just<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.780> plain

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
it would be if you had just a plain

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.160 
it would be if you had just a plain
screen<00:03:37.800> on<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.070> anyway<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:39.420> everything<00:03:39.989> else

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
screen on it anyway so everything else

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.170 
screen on it anyway so everything else
is<00:03:40.350> there<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.310> show<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
is there so just to show you that the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.720 
is there so just to show you that the
screen<00:03:42.450> does<00:03:42.630> work<00:03:42.870> open<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.709> up<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.250> then<00:03:44.580> it

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
screen does work open it up and then it

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:53.250 
screen does work open it up and then it
just<00:03:44.940> it's<00:03:45.780> very<00:03:45.989> responsive<00:03:46.670> so<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:47.940> not<00:03:48.060> a

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.960 

you<00:03:53.830> know<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:53.950> had<00:03:54.189> no<00:03:54.340> problems<00:03:54.790> with<00:03:54.849> that

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
you know I had no problems with that

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.110 
you know I had no problems with that
swiping<00:03:55.599> down<00:03:55.720> from<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:55.989> top<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:57.459> all<00:03:57.610> works

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
swiping down from the top it all works

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.699 
swiping down from the top it all works
really<00:03:58.239> well<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:58.989> I'll<00:03:59.079> go<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.349> put<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.560> in<00:03:59.620> the

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
really well so I'll go and put it in the

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.429 
really well so I'll go and put it in the
case<00:03:59.890> to<00:04:00.129> show<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.370> how<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.030> works<00:04:01.510> so<00:04:01.870> now

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
case to show you how that works so now

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.949 
case to show you how that works so now
you<00:04:02.500> just<00:04:02.799> take<00:04:02.980> this<00:04:03.250> again<00:04:04.150> making<00:04:04.750> sure<00:04:04.870> you

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
you just take this again making sure you

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.839 
you just take this again making sure you
have<00:04:05.079> it<00:04:05.170> in<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.319> right<00:04:05.470> orientation<00:04:05.980> and

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
have it in the right orientation and

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:13.020 
have it in the right orientation and
this<00:04:07.299> just<00:04:07.569> pops<00:04:08.049> into<00:04:08.319> it<00:04:11.400> being<00:04:12.400> two<00:04:12.640> pieces

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
this just pops into it being two pieces

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.600 
this just pops into it being two pieces
it<00:04:13.150> is<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.299> little<00:04:13.599> bit<00:04:13.720> more<00:04:13.900> awkward<00:04:14.049> than<00:04:14.470> it

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
it is a little bit more awkward than it

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.479 
it is a little bit more awkward than it
then<00:04:15.610> one<00:04:16.120> piece<00:04:16.329> this<00:04:16.750> case<00:04:17.079> but<00:04:17.530> once<00:04:18.400> you

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
then one piece this case but once you

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.460 
then one piece this case but once you
get<00:04:18.579> it<00:04:18.699> in<00:04:18.789> there<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:19.120> actually<00:04:19.239> stays<00:04:19.780> pretty

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
get it in there it actually stays pretty

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:32.520 
get it in there it actually stays pretty
good<00:04:30.389> so<00:04:31.389> it<00:04:31.449> clicks<00:04:31.720> right<00:04:31.960> in<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.229> can<00:04:32.260> hear

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
good so it clicks right in you can hear

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.439 
good so it clicks right in you can hear
it<00:04:32.650> click<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:35.710> there<00:04:36.100> you<00:04:36.220> go<00:04:36.340> it<00:04:37.150> actually

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
it click and there you go it actually

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:38.969 
it click and there you go it actually
has<00:04:37.539> a<00:04:37.570> little<00:04:37.750> plug<00:04:38.139> but<00:04:38.410> it<00:04:38.470> was<00:04:38.590> down<00:04:38.740> in<00:04:38.889> the

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
has a little plug but it was down in the

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.680 
has a little plug but it was down in the
headphone<00:04:39.400> there<00:04:39.639> now<00:04:40.210> this<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.479> not<00:04:40.660> a

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
didn't really want it because it's

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.000 
didn't really want it because it's
technically<00:04:59.500> not<00:04:59.710> doing<00:05:00.250> much<00:05:01.349> it<00:05:02.349> does<00:05:02.650> have

these corner buttons which are removable
you<00:05:07.120> can<00:05:07.180> actually<00:05:07.360> pop<00:05:07.750> that<00:05:07.960> out<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.979> does

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
you can actually pop that out it does

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.990 
you can actually pop that out it does
leave<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:09.910> hole<00:05:10.690> there<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:11.710> small<00:05:12.280> square<00:05:12.639> hole

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
leave a hole there a small square hole

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.480 
leave a hole there a small square hole
in<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.270> corners<00:05:13.660> but<00:05:13.810> I<00:05:14.590> actually<00:05:15.130> want<00:05:15.460> to

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
in the corners but I actually want to

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.060 
in the corners but I actually want to
keep<00:05:15.639> those<00:05:15.820> on<00:05:16.030> there<00:05:16.210> because<00:05:16.360> it's<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:17.080> nice

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
keep those on there because it's a nice

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.659 
keep those on there because it's a nice
bumpers<00:05:18.910> for<00:05:19.650> impact<00:05:20.650> protection<00:05:23.280> but<00:05:24.280> other

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
bumpers for impact protection but other

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.730 
bumpers for impact protection but other
than<00:05:24.849> that<00:05:24.910> it's<00:05:25.360> um<00:05:25.660> it's<00:05:26.229> a<00:05:26.289> pretty<00:05:26.500> nice

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
than that it's um it's a pretty nice

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.219 
than that it's um it's a pretty nice
little<00:05:27.220> case<00:05:27.639> it<00:05:29.699> it<00:05:30.699> it<00:05:31.510> protects<00:05:31.870> perfectly

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
little case it it it protects perfectly

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.170 
little case it it it protects perfectly
fine<00:05:32.410> it's<00:05:32.770> really<00:05:33.160> well<00:05:33.370> made<00:05:33.960> again<00:05:34.960> the

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
fine it's really well made again the

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.640 
fine it's really well made again the
matted<00:05:37.180> part<00:05:37.449> up<00:05:37.570> here<00:05:37.599> is<00:05:37.810> actually<00:05:38.320> soft

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
matted part up here is actually soft

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.129 
matted part up here is actually soft
sort<00:05:39.010> of<00:05:39.159> TPU<00:05:39.760> material<00:05:40.090> I<00:05:40.810> think<00:05:40.840> it's<00:05:41.050> the

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
sort of TPU material I think it's the

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.390 
sort of TPU material I think it's the
same<00:05:41.320> material<00:05:41.710> as<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.919> bumpers<00:05:42.250> on<00:05:42.370> the

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
same material as the bumpers on the

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.339 
same material as the bumpers on the
corners<00:05:42.789> and<00:05:42.970> then<00:05:43.479> the<00:05:43.570> rest<00:05:43.780> of<00:05:43.900> this<00:05:44.050> is<00:05:44.320> a

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
corners and then the rest of this is a

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.149 
corners and then the rest of this is a
slightly<00:05:45.250> hard<00:05:45.550> TPU<00:05:45.970> but<00:05:46.150> not<00:05:46.360> polycarbonate

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
slightly hard TPU but not polycarbonate

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:52.260 
slightly hard TPU but not polycarbonate
and<00:05:48.159> then<00:05:48.340> it<00:05:48.430> has<00:05:48.610> a<00:05:48.639> a<00:05:50.400> bubble<00:05:51.400> pattern<00:05:52.090> on

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
and then it has a a bubble pattern on

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.659 
and then it has a a bubble pattern on
the<00:05:52.360> inside<00:05:52.389> that<00:05:53.050> that<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:53.830> bumps<00:05:54.159> up<00:05:54.250> against

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
the inside that that it bumps up against

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.240 
the inside that that it bumps up against
now<00:05:55.120> it<00:05:55.690> doesn't<00:05:55.900> make<00:05:56.169> it<00:05:56.229> much<00:05:56.530> thicker<00:05:56.949> than

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
now it doesn't make it much thicker than

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.409 
now it doesn't make it much thicker than
the<00:05:57.520> phone<00:05:57.699> it<00:05:57.880> was<00:05:58.380> as<00:05:59.380> a<00:06:00.210> reference<00:06:01.210> for<00:06:01.389> that

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
the phone it was as a reference for that

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.499 
the phone it was as a reference for that
I<00:06:02.550> use<00:06:03.550> a

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:05.509 
I use a

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:10.189 
I use a
qi<00:06:07.460> inductive<00:06:08.460> charger<00:06:08.910> with<00:06:09.539> the<00:06:09.660> nexus<00:06:09.990> 5

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
qi inductive charger with the nexus 5

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.100 
qi inductive charger with the nexus 5
and<00:06:10.520> with<00:06:11.520> this<00:06:11.759> case<00:06:12.000> on<00:06:12.240> it<00:06:12.889> still<00:06:13.889> works<00:06:14.669> so

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
and with this case on it still works so

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.469 
and with this case on it still works so
that's<00:06:16.110> actually<00:06:16.379> really<00:06:16.590> cool<00:06:17.009> that<00:06:17.580> it

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
that's actually really cool that it

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.809 
that's actually really cool that it
doesn't<00:06:18.780> add<00:06:18.900> too<00:06:19.169> much<00:06:19.349> bulk<00:06:19.590> to<00:06:19.889> it<00:06:20.039> all<00:06:20.550> the
