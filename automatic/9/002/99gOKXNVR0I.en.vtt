router and Linksys gives what's called a

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.499 
router and Linksys gives what's called a
default<00:01:26.380> router<00:01:27.380> name<00:01:27.710> from<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.670> factory<00:01:29.180> and

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
default router name from the factory and

default router name from the factory and
in<00:01:29.900> this<00:01:30.079> case<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.500> was<00:01:30.650> never<00:01:30.860> changed<00:01:31.490> so

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
in this case it was never changed so

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.819 
in this case it was never changed so
that<00:01:31.850> was<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.390> name<00:01:32.540> of<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.869> name<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.710> the

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
that was the name of the the name of the

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.880 
that was the name of the the name of the
network<00:01:34.189> was<00:01:34.399> called<00:01:34.610> Linksys<00:01:35.030> but<00:01:35.810> in<00:01:36.049> most

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
network was called Linksys but in most

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.069 
network was called Linksys but in most
cases<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.729> name<00:01:37.970> of<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.329> network<00:01:38.540> is<00:01:39.020> a

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
cases the name of the network is a

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.100 
cases the name of the network is a
custom<00:01:39.680> name<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.299> so<00:01:41.299> you<00:01:41.360> would<00:01:41.600> need<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.810> put

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
custom name and so you would need to put

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.100 
custom name and so you would need to put
it<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.500> field<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.159> in<00:01:43.579> many<00:01:44.240> cases<00:01:44.570> that

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
it in that field and in many cases that

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.109 
it in that field and in many cases that
name<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.560> going<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:45.740> be<00:01:45.799> case<00:01:46.070> sensitive<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:46.700> if

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
name is going to be case sensitive so if

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.959 
name is going to be case sensitive so if
the<00:01:47.719> name<00:01:47.930> was<00:01:48.140> input<00:01:48.380> all<00:01:48.710> caps<00:01:49.040> make<00:01:49.759> sure

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
the name was input all caps make sure

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.959 
the name was input all caps make sure
you<00:01:50.090> match<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:50.329> here<00:01:50.990> all<00:01:51.140> caps<00:01:51.680> if<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.820> was

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
you match it here all caps if it was

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.260 
you match it here all caps if it was
half<00:01:53.180> caps<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:53.840> half<00:01:54.140> lowercase<00:01:54.820> again<00:01:55.850> match

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
half caps and half lowercase again match

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.779 
half caps and half lowercase again match
it<00:01:56.570> letter<00:01:56.899> for<00:01:57.200> letter<00:01:57.229> here<00:01:57.799> if<00:01:57.979> if<00:01:58.310> your

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
it letter for letter here if if your

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.060 
it letter for letter here if if your
router<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.390> case<00:01:59.659> sensitive<00:02:00.259> which<00:02:00.439> many<00:02:00.740> are

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
router is case sensitive which many are

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.090 
router is case sensitive which many are
because<00:02:01.729> it's<00:02:01.880> more<00:02:02.060> secure<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:03.259> must<00:02:03.590> match

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
because it's more secure you must match

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.310 
because it's more secure you must match
the<00:02:04.130> case<00:02:04.700> sensitivity<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.780> name<00:02:05.990> the

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
the case sensitivity in the name the

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.109 
the case sensitivity in the name the
next<00:02:07.280> thing<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.490> want<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.670> do<00:02:07.759> is<00:02:07.909> click<00:02:08.090> on

they<00:02:25.370> can<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.420> that's<00:02:26.599> really<00:02:27.020> not<00:02:27.349> a<00:02:27.410> wise

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
they can so that's really not a wise

they can so that's really not a wise
option<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:29.360> some<00:02:29.569> cases<00:02:29.780> you'll<00:02:30.080> find

option but in some cases you'll find

that people don't have any security and

that people don't have any security and
activated<00:02:32.510> because<00:02:32.780> they<00:02:33.470> want<00:02:33.860> their

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
year 2012 WEP WEP that's the most common

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.229 
year 2012 WEP WEP that's the most common
form<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.540> security<00:02:51.110> encryption<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:52.090> then<00:02:53.090> of

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
form of security encryption and then of

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.809 
form of security encryption and then of
course<00:02:53.269> you<00:02:53.540> have<00:02:53.630> wpa<00:02:54.110> wpa2<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.400> then<00:02:55.519> these

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
course you have wpa wpa2 and then these

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.460 
course you have wpa wpa2 and then these
other<00:02:56.090> options<00:02:56.660> down<00:02:56.810> here<00:02:57.019> at<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.140> bottom<00:02:57.260> of

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
other options down here at the bottom of

other options down here at the bottom of
the<00:02:57.560> list<00:02:57.799> but<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.720> need<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.350> know<00:03:00.530> what

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
the list but it you need to know what

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.640 
the list but it you need to know what
type<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.190> security<00:03:01.459> if<00:03:02.030> any<00:03:02.269> has<00:03:02.569> been<00:03:02.870> put

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
type of security if any has been put

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.509 
type of security if any has been put
into<00:03:03.980> your<00:03:04.819> router<00:03:05.780> because<00:03:06.350> if<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.400> don't

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
into your router because if you don't

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.820 
into your router because if you don't
know<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.480> put<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:09.140> select<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.680> wrong

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
know and you put you select the wrong

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.979 
know and you put you select the wrong
security<00:03:10.400> option<00:03:10.970> here<00:03:11.180> then<00:03:11.390> you're<00:03:11.690> still

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
security option here then you're still

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.150 
security option here then you're still
not<00:03:12.140> going<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.319> be<00:03:12.440> able<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.650> access<00:03:12.799> the

not going to be able to access the

not going to be able to access the
internet<00:03:13.489> through<00:03:13.519> your<00:03:13.760> router<00:03:14.060> now<00:03:14.720> of

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
course if there is no security option

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.680 
course if there is no security option
then<00:03:18.549> really<00:03:19.549> you're<00:03:19.850> it's<00:03:20.359> not<00:03:20.510> going<00:03:20.630> to

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
then really you're it's not going to

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.479 
then really you're it's not going to
matter<00:03:20.840> because<00:03:21.230> your<00:03:21.440> iPad's<00:03:21.799> just<00:03:22.040> should

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
matter because your iPad's just should

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.449

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
but in this case now where would you

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.530 
but in this case now where would you
find<00:03:28.280> this<00:03:28.430> information<00:03:28.670> in<00:03:29.180> other<00:03:29.299> words

find this information in other words

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.150 
find this information in other words
where<00:03:29.870> how<00:03:30.140> would<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.440> know<00:03:30.620> what<00:03:30.950> type<00:03:31.130> of

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
where how would you know what type of

where how would you know what type of
security<00:03:31.730> your<00:03:31.910> router<00:03:32.120> has<00:03:32.620> if<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:34.070> don't

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
security your router has if you don't

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.880 
security your router has if you don't
really<00:03:35.030> know<00:03:35.120> well<00:03:35.630> one<00:03:36.200> option<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.709> I<00:03:36.829> don't

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
really know well one option and I don't

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.470 
really know well one option and I don't
necessarily<00:03:37.130> recommend<00:03:37.700> this<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.269> could<00:03:38.450> go

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
necessarily recommend this you could go

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.360 
necessarily recommend this you could go
through<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.780> process<00:03:39.230> of<00:03:39.290> elimination<00:03:39.440> until

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
through the process of elimination until

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.090 
through the process of elimination until
you<00:03:40.519> figure<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.090> out<00:03:41.329> but<00:03:41.630> that<00:03:42.350> could<00:03:42.530> be<00:03:42.620> very

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
you figure it out but that could be very

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.039 
you figure it out but that could be very
frustrating<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:43.790> very<00:03:43.850> time-consuming<00:03:44.329> but

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
frustrating and very time-consuming but

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.490 
frustrating and very time-consuming but
it<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.739> an<00:03:45.890> option<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.400> does<00:03:46.579> work<00:03:47.350> but<00:03:48.350> in

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
it is an option and it does work but in

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.460 
it is an option and it does work but in
many<00:03:48.709> cases<00:03:49.160> if<00:03:50.090> it's<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.359> current<00:03:50.690> router<00:03:50.900> WEP

selected WEP and now you would type in

didn't find the network because I just

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.150 
didn't find the network because I just
typed<00:04:49.100> in<00:04:49.280> an<00:04:49.400> arbitrary<00:04:49.910> network<00:04:50.720> name<00:04:51.160> but

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
typed in an arbitrary network name but

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.420 
typed in an arbitrary network name but
we<00:04:52.880> could<00:04:53.090> go<00:04:53.300> back<00:04:53.889> select<00:04:54.889> this<00:04:55.130> one<00:04:55.190> here

we could go back select this one here

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.020 
we could go back select this one here
and<00:04:55.910> then<00:04:56.479> the<00:04:56.870> network<00:04:57.229> is<00:04:57.440> back<00:04:57.620> on<00:04:58.030> brought

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
and then the network is back on brought

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:08.800 
and then the network is back on brought
