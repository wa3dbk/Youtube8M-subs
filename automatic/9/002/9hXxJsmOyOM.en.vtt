00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.250 
see into a future and see like and only
see<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:07.130> he<00:04:08.130> can<00:04:08.280> see<00:04:08.580> about<00:04:09.390> like<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.660> two

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
see like a he can see about like a two

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.320 
see like a he can see about like a two
seconds<00:04:10.769> before<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.610> do<00:04:11.760> an<00:04:11.850> action<00:04:12.150> I

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
seconds before you do an action I

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.449 
seconds before you do an action I
believe<00:04:12.989> that's<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.380> case<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:14.280> like<00:04:14.430> a

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
believe that's the case it's like a

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.640 
believe that's the case it's like a
second<00:04:14.820> or<00:04:14.910> two<00:04:14.940> before<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:16.019> do<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.290> action

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
second or two before you do the action

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.000 
second or two before you do the action
and<00:04:16.859> really<00:04:17.430> he<00:04:17.729> has<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:18.150> react<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.780> that

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
and really he has to react to that

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.940 
and really he has to react to that
that's<00:04:20.010> kind<00:04:20.340> of<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.520> thing<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:21.710> from<00:04:22.710> that

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
that's kind of the thing and from that

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.310 
that's kind of the thing and from that
he<00:04:23.190> beats<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.550> first<00:04:23.820> dude<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.780> leave<00:04:25.050> and

he beats the first dude and I leave and

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.760 
he beats the first dude and I leave and
then<00:04:25.410> that

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
then that

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.219 
then that
