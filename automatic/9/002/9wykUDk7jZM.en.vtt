00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.200 
a little too much but I'll compensate by
adding<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> same<00:01:44.820> amount<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:46.649> rice<00:01:46.860> flour

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
adding the same amount of the rice flour

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.670 
adding the same amount of the rice flour
this<00:01:48.210> will<00:01:48.420> add<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> crispness<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
this will add to the crispness of the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.940 
this will add to the crispness of the
batter<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.659> seriously<00:01:51.659> batter<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.649> isn't

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
batter and seriously batter that isn't

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.039 
batter and seriously batter that isn't
crisp<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.549> nasty<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.240> mean<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.899> like

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
crisp it's just nasty I mean it's like

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.690 
crisp it's just nasty I mean it's like
having<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.439> doughnut<00:01:55.799> around<00:01:56.070> your<00:01:56.189> fish<00:01:56.579> or
