00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.359
 Come on, talk with jose 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.119
 rodriguez cross country runner o 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.770
 has participated in numerous events or 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.640
 are going to give us a series of advice from 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.640
 how to descend 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.860
 has two tips on how to descend 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.040
 effectively 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.110
 good depending on the terrain 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.810
 when the descent has less 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.620
 irregularities and it's like easier to 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.900
 run what you are looking for is a descent 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.820
 with a wider stride for 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.400
 take advantage of the terrain and took advantage of the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.210
 speed and go covering more distances 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.950
 with the opposite case is when the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.520
 terrain is more irregular and more thein 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.830
 where a lot of stone many roots what 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.740
 it is to look rather short steps 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.780
 but more confident when taking a short step 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.430
 we have the facility that with 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.920
 any irregularity we can 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.979
 move with greater agility when you go 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.110
 running as you can for example let's 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.330
 in a curve how can you detect the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.550
 type of terrain actions that you notice 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.050
 the first thing you notice to know that 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.229
 if it's going to be taken in terms of descent 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.840
 the look that always goes to about 10 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.369
 meters forward then one already has 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.560
 than to anticipate what the 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.720
 movement there is going to see how is the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.149
 ground to go thinking how I'm going to 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.149
 take the curve and as a social better
