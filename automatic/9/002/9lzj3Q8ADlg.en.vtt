hey<00:00:01.199> everyone<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.920> Ross<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.760> this<00:00:03.060> isn't

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hey everyone this is Ross and this isn't

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.539 
hey everyone this is Ross and this isn't
about<00:00:03.419> date<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.230> 15<00:00:04.589> gallon<00:00:04.830> since<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.370> put

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
about date of the 15 gallon since I put

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.210 
about date of the 15 gallon since I put
the<00:00:05.580> C<00:00:05.850> cam<00:00:06.089> black<00:00:06.330> fluoride<00:00:06.720> sound<00:00:07.049> in<00:00:07.259> and

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
the C cam black fluoride sound in and

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.070 
the C cam black fluoride sound in and
it's<00:00:08.429> been<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> week<00:00:08.940> since<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.389> put<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.840> I

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
it's been a week since I put it in I

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.499 
it's been a week since I put it in I
said<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:10.950> doing<00:00:11.130> up<00:00:11.340> there<00:00:11.490> five<00:00:12.000> days<00:00:12.030> after

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
said that doing up there five days after

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.950 
said that doing up there five days after
I<00:00:12.660> put<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.349> just<00:00:13.620> waited<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.160> week

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
I put it in but I just waited for a week

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.660 
I put it in but I just waited for a week
so<00:00:15.960> probably<00:00:16.320> probably<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.100> most<00:00:17.279> noticeable

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
so probably probably the most noticeable

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.050 
so probably probably the most noticeable
difference<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.930> clarity<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.529> water

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
difference is the clarity of the water

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.640 
difference is the clarity of the water
you<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.119> see<00:00:21.270> right<00:00:21.750> till<00:00:21.990> about<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.260> tank

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
you can see right till about the tank

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.080 
you can see right till about the tank
crystal<00:00:23.490> clear<00:00:23.730> that's<00:00:23.910> perfect

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
crystal clear that's perfect

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.210 
crystal clear that's perfect
and<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.420> also<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:28.019> which<00:00:28.439> ways<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and you can also see which ways for the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.229 
and you can also see which ways for the
tank<00:00:29.840> will<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.260> back<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.790> clearest

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
tank will be the back so it's a clearest

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.930 
tank will be the back so it's a clearest
that's<00:00:33.450> ever<00:00:33.719> been<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.200> think<00:00:34.579> because<00:00:35.579> they

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
that's ever been I think because they

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
that's ever been I think because they
release<00:00:36.420> tannins<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> water<00:00:37.710> would<00:00:37.980> stay

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
release tannins and the water would stay

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.910 
release tannins and the water would stay
in<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> water<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.260> light<00:00:40.260> yellow<00:00:40.500> color

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
in the water like a light yellow color

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.430 
in the water like a light yellow color
kind<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.309> like<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> teacup

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
kind of like a teacup

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.420 
kind of like a teacup
so<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:44.430> C<00:00:44.730> chem<00:00:45.000> stuff<00:00:45.360> doesn't<00:00:45.840> release<00:00:46.110> any

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
so this C chem stuff doesn't release any

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.160 
so this C chem stuff doesn't release any
type<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> tannins<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> water<00:00:48.660> because

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
type of tannins in the water because

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.810 
type of tannins in the water because
it's<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.649> neutral<00:00:50.219> doesn't<00:00:50.399> release

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
it's just neutral doesn't release

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's just neutral doesn't release
anything<00:00:51.649> does<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.010> pH<00:00:53.370> nothing<00:00:53.789> like

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
anything does not like pH nothing like

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.380 
anything does not like pH nothing like
that<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.140> waters<00:00:55.789> hasn't<00:00:56.789> got<00:00:56.910> any<00:00:57.120> type

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
that so the waters hasn't got any type

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.580 
that so the waters hasn't got any type
of<00:00:57.420> tint<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.370> clear<00:00:59.870> also<00:01:00.870> when<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
of tint it's just clear also when the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.200 
of tint it's just clear also when the
deer<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> used<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.280> come<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.730> used<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> lie

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
deer it used to come up it used to lie

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
deer it used to come up it used to lie
on<00:01:03.239> top<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> gravel<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> quarry<00:01:05.070> cuts

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
on top of the gravel and the quarry cuts

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.219 
on top of the gravel and the quarry cuts
used<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.670> come<00:01:05.850> along<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.390> kind<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.810> kick<00:01:07.049> up

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
used to come along and kind of kick up

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.710 
used to come along and kind of kick up
the<00:01:07.350> dirt<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.520> used<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> float<00:01:09.060> around<00:01:09.240> so

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the dirt and it used to float around so

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.690 
the dirt and it used to float around so
you<00:01:09.780> start<00:01:10.110> floating<00:01:10.439> particles<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> fish

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you start floating particles in the fish

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.350 
you start floating particles in the fish
tank<00:01:11.900> which<00:01:12.900> wasn't<00:01:13.170> very<00:01:13.320> attractive<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:15.150> now

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
tank which wasn't very attractive so now

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
tank which wasn't very attractive so now
it's<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.650> water<00:01:16.860> isn't<00:01:17.070> even<00:01:17.369> there

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
it's it's as if a water isn't even there

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.960 
it's it's as if a water isn't even there
it's<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.000> air<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.689> amazing<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.970> the

crisp red lanes on the fish come out a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.060 
crisp red lanes on the fish come out a
lot<00:01:23.700> better<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.500> really<00:01:25.500> pleased<00:01:25.799> with

red tiger Lotus is doing absolutely
great<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.420> still<00:01:39.750> red<00:01:40.049> which<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.470> good

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
great it's still red which is good

triangular<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.270> ready<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:58.110> unfold<00:01:58.290> so

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
triangular one there ready to unfold so

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.459 
triangular one there ready to unfold so
that's<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> leaves<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.110> week<00:02:01.290> which

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that's going to leaves in a week which

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.190 
that's going to leaves in a week which
I'm<00:02:01.649> astonished<00:02:01.979> about<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:04.020> has

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
I'm astonished about and this one has

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.690 
I'm astonished about and this one has
grown<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.649> new<00:02:04.890> leaves<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> week<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.670> well

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
grown to new leaves in a week as well

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.050 
grown to new leaves in a week as well
them<00:02:06.659> too<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.670> sure<00:02:08.849> if<00:02:08.910> that's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
them too so I'm not sure if that's

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.180 
them too so I'm not sure if that's
because<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.450> lights<00:02:09.720> or<00:02:10.170> if<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:10.500> because<00:02:10.890> of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
because the lights or if it's because of

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.530 
because the lights or if it's because of
the<00:02:11.250> substrate<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:12.000> definitely<00:02:12.390> enough

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the substrate it's definitely enough

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.290 
the substrate it's definitely enough
because

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
because

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.230 
because
because<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.900> don't<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:14.320> any<00:02:14.530> inner<00:02:14.710> stank<00:02:15.240> and

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
because I don't have any inner stank and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.060 
because I don't have any inner stank and
I<00:02:16.540> don't<00:02:16.600> think<00:02:16.810> it's<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.200> lights<00:02:17.500> because

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
I don't think it's the lights because

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.430 
I don't think it's the lights because
they're<00:02:18.550> only<00:02:18.730> Tate's<00:02:19.300> you'd<00:02:19.750> expect<00:02:20.260> them<00:02:20.410> to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
they're only Tate's you'd expect them to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.520 
they're only Tate's you'd expect them to
grow<00:02:20.650> really<00:02:20.920> well<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.340> T<00:02:21.580> fives<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.350> only

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
grow really well of T fives so I only

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.550 
grow really well of T fives so I only
leave<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.040> substrate<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:25.000> they<00:02:25.720> simulate<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
leave the substrate so they simulate the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.720 
leave the substrate so they simulate the
substrate<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:28.330> also<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.560> dwarf<00:02:29.830> sag<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.520> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
substrate and also the dwarf sag and the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.140 
substrate and also the dwarf sag and the
Ludwig<00:02:30.940> yeah<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.680> expect<00:02:32.680> those<00:02:32.920> plans<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.880> turn

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
Ludwig yeah I expect those plans to turn

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.110 
Ludwig yeah I expect those plans to turn
slightly<00:02:34.600> slightly<00:02:35.380> yellow<00:02:35.920> if<00:02:36.490> there<00:02:36.850> wasn't

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
slightly slightly yellow if there wasn't

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.960 
slightly slightly yellow if there wasn't
enough<00:02:37.330> nutrients<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:37.990> here<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.620> I've<00:02:39.160> stayed

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
enough nutrients in here and I've stayed

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.300 
enough nutrients in here and I've stayed
pretty<00:02:40.240> green<00:02:40.600> I<00:02:40.780> mean<00:02:40.960> this<00:02:41.110> one<00:02:41.350> yellow

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
pretty green I mean this one yellow

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.190 
pretty green I mean this one yellow
shoot<00:02:42.670> there<00:02:42.850> but<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.330> might<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:43.780> be<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.930> bad

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
shoot there but that might just be a bad

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.100 
shoot there but that might just be a bad
leave<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.880> Ludwig<00:02:46.090> yes<00:02:46.450> still<00:02:46.840> up<00:02:46.990> in

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
leave and the Ludwig yes still up in

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.160 
leave and the Ludwig yes still up in
green<00:02:47.350> it's<00:02:47.560> growing<00:02:47.950> great<00:02:48.190> as<00:02:48.430> well<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:50.080> it

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
green it's growing great as well so it

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.020 
green it's growing great as well so it
really<00:02:50.230> suggests<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.460> there's<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.760> lot<00:02:51.910> of

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
really suggests that there's a lot of

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.670 
really suggests that there's a lot of
nutrients<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.720> sub<00:02:52.990> screen<00:02:53.290> cuz<00:02:53.500> it's

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
nutrients in this sub screen cuz it's

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.510 
nutrients in this sub screen cuz it's
basically<00:02:54.130> clay<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:55.620> Dustin<00:02:56.620> goes<00:02:56.830> on<00:02:57.130> about

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
basically clay and Dustin goes on about

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.220 
basically clay and Dustin goes on about
clay<00:02:58.060> quite<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.390> lot<00:02:58.630> in<00:02:58.750> those<00:02:58.840> videos<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:01.230> move

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
clay quite a lot in those videos to move

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.590 
clay quite a lot in those videos to move
on<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.560> Rotella<00:03:03.160> it's<00:03:03.970> been<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.180> lot<00:03:04.420> and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
on to the Rotella it's been a lot and

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.990 
on to the Rotella it's been a lot and
you<00:03:04.660> grew<00:03:04.870> up<00:03:04.930> on<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.320> on<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.070> end<00:03:06.160> or<00:03:06.490> I<00:03:06.550> am

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
you grew up on this on the end or I am

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.960 
you grew up on this on the end or I am
this<00:03:07.360> new<00:03:07.570> growth<00:03:07.870> since<00:03:08.200> last<00:03:08.470> week<00:03:08.740> and<00:03:09.130> if

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
this new growth since last week and if

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.850 
this new growth since last week and if
you<00:03:10.090> notice<00:03:10.450> all<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.840> rotella<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.470> actually

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
you notice all the rotella is actually

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.670 
you notice all the rotella is actually
pointing<00:03:12.340> this<00:03:12.580> way<00:03:12.990> it's<00:03:13.990> actually<00:03:14.140> pointing

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
pointing this way it's actually pointing

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.520 
pointing this way it's actually pointing
towards<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.160> window<00:03:15.570> cuz<00:03:16.570> in<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.840> morning<00:03:17.200> I

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
towards a window cuz in the morning I

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.920 
towards a window cuz in the morning I
get<00:03:17.890> lightning<00:03:18.160> yeah<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:18.790> cuz<00:03:19.480> it's<00:03:19.630> East

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
get lightning yeah and cuz it's East

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.460 
get lightning yeah and cuz it's East
Pearson<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:22.060> keep<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.600> blinds<00:03:22.810> closed<00:03:23.230> but

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
Pearson I keep the blinds closed but

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.680 
Pearson I keep the blinds closed but
sunlight<00:03:23.890> still<00:03:24.250> manages<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.940> get<00:03:25.060> through<00:03:25.390> so

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
sunlight still manages to get through so

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.170 
sunlight still manages to get through so
they're<00:03:26.650> responding<00:03:27.070> really<00:03:27.430> well<00:03:27.640> in<00:03:28.000> the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
they're responding really well in the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.990 
they're responding really well in the
environment<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:29.080> melted<00:03:29.320> back<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.000> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
environment I have melted back and the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.140 
environment I have melted back and the
redtag<00:03:31.420> lorises<00:03:32.020> have<00:03:32.230> melted<00:03:32.620> back<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:34.000> in

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
redtag lorises have melted back and in

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.730 
redtag lorises have melted back and in
general<00:03:34.540> or<00:03:34.690> all<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.200> plants<00:03:35.560> are<00:03:35.650> doing

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
general or all the plants are doing

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.930 
general or all the plants are doing
really<00:03:35.980> great<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:38.190> even<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.280> knew<00:03:39.490> this<00:03:39.700> was

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
really great and even you knew this was

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.090 
really great and even you knew this was
doing<00:03:40.120> well<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.600> mean<00:03:40.870> send<00:03:41.260> off<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.410> new<00:03:41.650> leaf<00:03:41.920> at

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
doing well I mean send off a new leaf at

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.430 
doing well I mean send off a new leaf at
the<00:03:42.220> back<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.720> because<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.810> was<00:03:43.900> attacked<00:03:44.260> by

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
the back and because it was attacked by

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.830 
the back and because it was attacked by
algae<00:03:44.830> quite<00:03:45.100> a<00:03:45.130> while<00:03:45.370> ago<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:46.450> lot<00:03:46.690> the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
algae quite a while ago and a lot the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.420 
algae quite a while ago and a lot the
leaves<00:03:47.050> just<00:03:47.170> died<00:03:47.530> off<00:03:47.800> and<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:47.980> had<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.190> cut

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
leaves just died off and I had to cut

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.800 
leaves just died off and I had to cut
them<00:03:48.550> off<00:03:48.700> but<00:03:48.970> now<00:03:49.090> it's<00:03:49.240> starting<00:03:49.570> to<00:03:49.600> grow

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
them off but now it's starting to grow
