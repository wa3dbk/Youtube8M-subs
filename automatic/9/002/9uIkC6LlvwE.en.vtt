00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
everything else so I figured why not go

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.930 
everything else so I figured why not go
ahead<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.899> try<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.670> sell<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.700> while

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
ahead and try to do it and sell it while

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.770 
ahead and try to do it and sell it while
it's<00:00:45.120> at<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> peak<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:47.160> price<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.600> let's<00:00:48.719> go

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
it's at a peak of a price so let's go

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170 
it's at a peak of a price so let's go
ahead<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.960> check<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.289> exactly<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.730> DRC

open<00:02:05.549> space<00:02:05.990> play<00:02:06.990> wreck<00:02:07.229> DRC<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.829> better<00:02:08.039> by

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
open space play wreck DRC is better by

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.440 
open space play wreck DRC is better by
two<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.660> speed<00:02:10.050> on<00:02:10.319> VRC<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.459> better<00:02:11.670> by<00:02:11.879> one

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
two and in speed on VRC is better by one

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.750 
two and in speed on VRC is better by one
but<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:12.870> Pat<00:02:13.500> Pete<00:02:13.739> does<00:02:14.010> give<00:02:14.220> plus<00:02:14.459> do<00:02:14.640> to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
but this Pat Pete does give plus do to

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.119 
but this Pat Pete does give plus do to
speed<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.319> pair<00:02:16.560> them<00:02:16.739> up<00:02:16.890> together

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
speed so if you pair them up together

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.210 
speed so if you pair them up together
then<00:02:18.120> they're<00:02:18.300> both<00:02:18.450> going<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:18.690> have<00:02:18.920> 99<00:02:19.920> speed

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
then they're both going to have 99 speed

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.229 
then they're both going to have 99 speed
or<00:02:20.459> if<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.940> cap<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.180> whatever<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.440> 105<00:02:23.239> 110

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
or if the cap is whatever it is 105 110

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.479 
or if the cap is whatever it is 105 110
whatever<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.720> speed<00:02:25.349> cap<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.830> or<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.400> the

reigning<00:02:26.819> cab<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.150> general<00:02:27.800> then<00:02:28.800> they'll

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
reigning cab in general then they'll

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.570 
reigning cab in general then they'll
both<00:02:29.160> go<00:02:29.340> up<00:02:29.370> over<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:30.630> hundred<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.580> well

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
jim schwartz eglise pursuit of speed so

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.600 
jim schwartz eglise pursuit of speed so
that'll<00:02:48.840> give<00:02:48.989> me<00:02:49.019> an<00:02:49.470> additional<00:02:50.069> plus<00:02:50.370> 32

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.729 
that'll give me an additional plus 32
speed<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.120> then<00:02:51.599> we'll<00:02:51.810> go<00:02:51.900> up<00:02:52.019> over<00:02:52.140> 100<00:02:52.620> so
