00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.410
 six to six in a confined space that 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.760
 means many tackles many deals 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.309
 intensive session on Wednesday afternoon 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.690
 for the hunter and co and he cheers 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.690
 every goal as in the game 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:23.880
 we have to play these games at home 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.010
 win if we do that then sees 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.470
 it's good for timo what's he listening to 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:34.350
 ex-stuttgart from stuttgart but not 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.440
 such a good mood last two games 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.320
 lost and i think want a bit 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.790
 to make reparation and it is 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.010
 also positively prepare for 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.140
 Pokalendspiel because you drive I think 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.149
 tremendously the interaction even if 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.730
 Bayern Munich is one of them 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.160
 or other victory has borne and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.930
 That's why I believe that I'm here 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.539
 comes and gives the game there 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.870
 we really have to wait and see 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.789
 just focus on our task ourselves 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.520
 own game we play the last time 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.890
 at home 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.350
 then we can know the game 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.900
 also win and if we do after 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.120
 you even look then brings us nothing 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.190
 after the return of Lucia and Farfan 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.130
 is very cool a gÃ©ng et the worrying child 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.990
 be inner band in the knee makes problems 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.400
 but maybe it was better that too 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.970
 he is not with these problems 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.500
 training was today fox laid china 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.330
 finds nothing wrong it was right 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.730
 pepper in it as well as directly 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.100
 then at hunter against marica 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:42.100
 hoppala 100 percent use yes with theirs 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.150
 Retrieve services and train well 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.070
 with a hundred percent use and yourself 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.960
 improve yourself and if you can 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.690
 you do not do it then you will not 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.830
 better, I think that's part of it today 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.130
 in training that was right 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.080
 Aggressiveness was passauer it went now 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.840
 aggressive to the point and if you are accurate 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.360
 to act like today and also the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.300
 last two games then we have the 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.149
 get threes then the season thinks 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.850
 it also because you expect that 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.500
 frankfurt to bring thunderstorm 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.640
 if you believe in winning and i hope 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.390
 that we are enough 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.810
 Horst gates have upholstery 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.180
 so I hope that we have everything 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.790
 is decided and I think in bremen 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.110
 is a heavy task for frankfurt 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.910
 something to pick because we have to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.930
 necessarily have used profit but 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.090
 even against hope home fit 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.800
 need and not managed and 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.810
 that's why it's also heavily under pressure 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.540
 but with which tricks first only on 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.880
 ourselves already and ibo looks closely 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.910
 he comments from behind 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.700
 he drives us when we become aggressive 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.820
 go works and think it runs from 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.489
 alone then we can get three points 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.050
 so that both show that we 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.430
 also can have patience you need 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.769
 flash on saturday if it is not so 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.600
 you never know how a game works 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.700
 it's easy to get fast 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.489
 Go ahead as well as against leverkusen and 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.209
 then come back and 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.800
 Correspondingly easy for the moral 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.739
 from the team and for the character 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.180
 and that was just necessarily one 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.769
 want to reach fourth place and then 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.330
 about the quali again the champions 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.280
 league though international 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.640
 Attention had the hand today 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.640
 beautiful
