00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:16.630
 We continue the theme of horror stories and today 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.700
 us origami bring for making 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.220
 this crafts take a square sheet 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.740
 paper no matter what size is important 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:30.040
 so it was a square we fold it by 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:34.480
 we rotate the diagonals and once again 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:39.370
 diagonally turn over our stocking 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.270
 and fold in half unfolding and more 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.270
 once hit 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.330
 unfold the paper and raise our 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.760
 holding the workpiece extreme side 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.450
 we fold it like this 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.930
 square here is this side we should 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.330
 bend in the center line with us 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:09.810
 it turns out such a long triangle 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:09.810
 and the opposite too to the central 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.810
 here we line this line fold 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:33.530
 unfold the paper open and 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.530
 lay out a long lozenge 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.540
 on the intended folds 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.749
 we fold the triangle back 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:59.329
 turn over the workpiece and again to 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:59.329
 center line bends one side 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.700
 and second but 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:21.989
 schedule for not us type 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.500
 unfold the paper and lay out the gel 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.069
 on 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.069
 and evidence 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.130
 laying 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.710
 raise our billet turn away 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.210
 one petal here we have it 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.360
 turn away now we need him 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.990
 bend pushing fingers down and when 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.650
 this we get it together 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:59.020
 so here we have a petal when we 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.020
 hold down this pen holding 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.640
 one 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.640
 and 2 exactly the same 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.460
 we fold our figure in half top 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.150
 corner 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:33.600
 you will be a hood from a kib w and pulled over 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.600
 tail 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.830
 now we make every side with a pen 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.830
 small fold out from kybaman 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.890
 from this side just as symmetrical 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.730
 Now let's work with the hood with us 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.340
 will be slightly curled up 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.980
 finger bend up and lay 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.100
 fold can be one side a little bit 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.230
 lower down pulling for help leaving 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.230
 the remaining side will remain so 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:25.300
 every pen about fire inside 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.300
 make a fold 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.050
 and palm 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.720
 from another in the same way 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.490
 after 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.389
 and palm 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.420
 turn over our billet we have to 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.580
 do so that our conduct could 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:05.610
 stand we raise the triangle up when 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.460
 this bend in half and arms 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.040
 straightening this one 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:15.800
 hostage wrong folds but us 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.800
 even so interesting this same ghost 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.430
 we have turned the folds of the cloak again 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:33.440
 straighten the hood fix the knobs 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.440
