with<00:00:15.000> my<00:00:15.210> master<00:00:15.540> great<00:00:15.750> gundam<00:00:16.080> exia<00:00:16.199> when<00:00:17.010> I

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
with my master great gundam exia when I

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.500 
with my master great gundam exia when I
was<00:00:17.220> taking<00:00:17.490> her<00:00:17.609> from<00:00:17.820> regular<00:00:18.150> mode<00:00:18.330> and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
was taking her from regular mode and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.150 
was taking her from regular mode and
putting<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.810> into<00:00:18.930> repair<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.560> broke<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
putting it into repair I broke the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.200 
putting it into repair I broke the
yellow<00:00:20.460> antenna<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.199> chest<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.939> can

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
yellow antenna on the chest so I can

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.550 
yellow antenna on the chest so I can
still<00:00:24.390> drive<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:24.779> there<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.350> still

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
still drive it on there but it's still

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.620 
still drive it on there but it's still
better<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.430> thought<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:27.090> actually<00:00:27.510> gave

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
better I just thought it actually gave

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.910 
better I just thought it actually gave
me<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> motivation<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.320> go<00:00:28.470> read<00:00:28.710> through

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
me the motivation to go read through

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.620 
me the motivation to go read through
this<00:00:29.010> small<00:00:29.279> print<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.670> figure<00:00:29.880> out<00:00:29.910> how<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
this small print and figure out how to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.610 
this small print and figure out how to
order<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.380> replacement<00:00:31.679> part<00:00:33.020> from<00:00:34.020> Van<00:00:34.350> Dyne

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
order a replacement part from Van Dyne

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.860 
order a replacement part from Van Dyne
so<00:00:35.190> any<00:00:35.520> gun<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> manual<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.360> going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.690> come

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
so any gun the manual is going to come

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.600 
so any gun the manual is going to come
with<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.770> see<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.100> right<00:00:38.399> on

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
with this and you can see it right on

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.459 
with this and you can see it right on
here<00:00:38.850> where<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.149> says<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.570> use<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.870> Japan<00:00:39.989> only

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
here where it says for use in Japan only

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.319 
here where it says for use in Japan only
so<00:00:40.829> that's<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.340> bad<00:00:41.579> news<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:41.820> most<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.300> my

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
so that's really bad news for most of my

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
so that's really bad news for most of my
viewers<00:00:42.719> because<00:00:43.050> unless<00:00:44.010> you're<00:00:44.160> living

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
viewers because unless you're living

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.400 
viewers because unless you're living
here<00:00:44.430> you're<00:00:44.850> not<00:00:45.090> able<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.809> go<00:00:45.930> ahead<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.320> do

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
here you're not able to go ahead and do

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.319 
here you're not able to go ahead and do
this<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.370> thought<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.789> would<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:48.030> let<00:00:48.239> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
this but I thought I would just let you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.900 
this but I thought I would just let you
know<00:00:48.360> how<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.440> case<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.680> do<00:00:50.550> need<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
know how to do it in case you do need to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.150 
know how to do it in case you do need to
know<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.930> basically<00:00:52.110> all<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.039> is

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
know so basically all you have to do is

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.830 
know so basically all you have to do is
look<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.640> information<00:00:54.300> which<00:00:54.510> shows

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
look for this information which shows

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.229 
look for this information which shows
the<00:00:55.170> price<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.770> parts<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.699> price<00:00:56.940> for

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the price for parts and the price for

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.510 
the price for parts and the price for
shipping<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.739> top<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> part

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
you break it or did you lose it so my

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.490 
you break it or did you lose it so my
case<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.729> broke<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.180> they<00:02:03.840> also<00:02:03.960> asked<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.350> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
case I broke it they also asked for a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.600 
case I broke it they also asked for a
phone<00:02:04.710> number<00:02:04.740> where<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.219> be<00:02:05.369> reached

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
phone number where you can be reached

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.150 
phone number where you can be reached
during<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.030> day<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.390> your<00:02:07.079> age<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> guess

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
