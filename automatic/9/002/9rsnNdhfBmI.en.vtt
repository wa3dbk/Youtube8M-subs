00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
good I think and right in the very

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.830 
good I think and right in the very
beginning<00:02:49.520> like<00:02:49.880> we<00:02:50.030> are<00:02:50.180> here<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.390> make<00:02:50.660> sure

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
beginning like we are here I make sure

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.780 
beginning like we are here I make sure
that<00:02:51.020> when<00:02:51.140> i'm<00:02:51.230> looking<00:02:51.710> at<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.920> hair<00:02:52.130> that

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
that when i'm looking at the hair that

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.880 
that when i'm looking at the hair that
my<00:02:53.060> drawing<00:02:55.990> stroke<00:02:56.990> is<00:02:58.630> is<00:02:59.710> working<00:03:00.710> in<00:03:00.830> the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
my drawing stroke is is working in the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.030 
my drawing stroke is is working in the
same<00:03:01.130> motion<00:03:02.120> as<00:03:02.240> my<00:03:02.450> hair<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.260> mean<00:03:03.500> my

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
same motion as my hair so I mean my

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.820 
same motion as my hair so I mean my
stroke<00:03:04.430> will<00:03:04.700> be<00:03:05.300> defined<00:03:05.720> I'll<00:03:06.020> define<00:03:06.530> the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
stroke will be defined I'll define the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.130 
stroke will be defined I'll define the

right<00:03:16.070> from<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.340> get<00:03:16.670> go<00:03:16.700> like<00:03:17.270> this<00:03:18.400> starting

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
right from the get go like this starting

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.550 
right from the get go like this starting
right<00:03:19.520> on<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.730> inside<00:03:20.140> where<00:03:21.140> it<00:03:21.200> comes<00:03:21.380> down

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
right on the inside where it comes down

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:37.110
