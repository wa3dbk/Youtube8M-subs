want<00:01:21.090> rooms<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:22.439> thinking<00:01:22.680> this

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
want rooms to be and I'm thinking this

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.560 
want rooms to be and I'm thinking this
might<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.820> servants

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
might be kind of like a servants

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.749 
might be kind of like a servants
quarters<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.110> here<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.830> also<00:01:25.950> kind<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.549> at

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
quarters in here but also kind of a at

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.310 
quarters in here but also kind of a at
kind<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.180> central<00:01:27.450> hub<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.990> said<00:01:28.200> for

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
kind of a central hub like I said for

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.440 
kind of a central hub like I said for
the<00:01:28.409> basement<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.460> maybe<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.030> here

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the basement and then maybe like here

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330 
the basement and then maybe like here
would<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.259> stairs<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.860> would<00:01:31.950> take<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.189> up<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
would be stairs it would take you up to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.770 
would be stairs it would take you up to
this<00:01:32.549> second<00:01:32.939> level<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.450> then<00:01:33.659> you'll

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
this second level here and then you'll

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.530 
this second level here and then you'll
be<00:01:33.810> good<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.860> yeah<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.759> will<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
be good so yeah like this will be like a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.819 
be good so yeah like this will be like a
kind<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.900> come<00:01:37.020> across<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.590> you'll<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.770> able

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
kind of come across and you'll be able

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.080 
kind of come across and you'll be able
to<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:38.040> downstairs<00:01:38.220> from<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.820> won't<00:01:38.970> be

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
to go downstairs from here this won't be

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.060 
to go downstairs from here this won't be
the<00:01:39.119> only<00:01:39.299> way<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.619> downstairs

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the only way to get to the downstairs

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.260 
the only way to get to the downstairs
area<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> mean<00:01:41.790> there'll<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:41.939> other<00:01:42.150> ways

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
area but I mean there'll be other ways

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.210 
area but I mean there'll be other ways
I'm<00:01:42.450> thinking<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.750> putting<00:01:42.899> maybe<00:01:43.140> some<00:01:43.439> some

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
I'm thinking of putting maybe some some

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.670 
I'm thinking of putting maybe some some
like<00:01:44.399> circular<00:01:44.670> staircases<00:01:45.360> or<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:46.320> kind<00:01:46.649> of

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
like circular staircases or what kind of

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
like circular staircases or what kind of
staircases<00:01:47.070> what's<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> word<00:01:48.030> I'm<00:01:48.149> thinking

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
staircases what's the word I'm thinking

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.100 
staircases what's the word I'm thinking
of<00:01:49.490> yeah<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.270> know<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.540> some<00:01:51.720> spiral

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
of yeah but you know like some spiral

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.510 
of yeah but you know like some spiral
staircases<00:01:52.470> would<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:52.920> some<00:01:53.070> spell<00:01:53.310> two

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
staircases would have some spell two

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.280 
staircases would have some spell two
staircases<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.270> these<00:01:54.659> kind<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.020> circular

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
staircases in these kind of circular

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.709 
staircases in these kind of circular
bits<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.640> would<00:01:56.729> come<00:01:56.909> down<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
bits and that would come down to the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.630 
bits and that would come down to the
basement<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.590> I'm<00:01:59.310> not<00:01:59.430> really<00:01:59.520> sure

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
basement here and I'm not really sure

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.130 
basement here and I'm not really sure
what<00:01:59.939> I<00:01:59.969> want<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.329> with<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.570> huge<00:02:00.840> space

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
what I want to do with this huge space

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.959 
what I want to do with this huge space
yet<00:02:01.409> I'm<00:02:01.590> thinking<00:02:01.920> maybe<00:02:02.040> we<00:02:02.700> could<00:02:02.850> do

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
yet I'm thinking maybe we could do

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.030 
yet I'm thinking maybe we could do
something<00:02:03.210> we're<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.380> kind<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.799> drop

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
something we're on you kind of like drop

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.590 
something we're on you kind of like drop
down<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.820> block<00:02:06.060> right<00:02:06.090> under

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
down because like the block right under

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600 
down because like the block right under
me<00:02:06.719> here<00:02:06.869> I'll<00:02:07.500> show<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.799> guys<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:07.979> actually

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
me here I'll show you guys is actually

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.119 
me here I'll show you guys is actually
water<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:09.959> could<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.229> something<00:02:10.440> where<00:02:10.800> you

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
water so we could do something where you

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.800 
water so we could do something where you
just<00:02:11.370> drop<00:02:11.700> down<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.180> maybe<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.569> there's<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
just drop down and maybe like there's a

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.780 
just drop down and maybe like there's a
boat<00:02:13.020> dock<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.560> then

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
boat dock and then

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.420 
boat dock and then
and<00:02:13.879> like<00:02:14.120> perhaps<00:02:14.719> it<00:02:15.019> on<00:02:15.319> it<00:02:15.799> opens<00:02:16.099> up<00:02:16.189> over

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
and like perhaps it on it opens up over

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.530 
and like perhaps it on it opens up over
here<00:02:16.579> and<00:02:16.670> then<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.849> can<00:02:16.969> jump<00:02:17.150> into<00:02:17.299> boats

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
here and then you can jump into boats

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.720 
here and then you can jump into boats
and<00:02:17.750> like<00:02:17.900> we've<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:19.099> out<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.459> way<00:02:19.609> and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
and like we've like out this way and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.009 
and like we've like out this way and
then<00:02:19.819> be<00:02:19.909> kind<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.150> like<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:20.299> secret<00:02:20.629> entrance<00:02:20.750> I

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
then be kind of like a secret entrance I

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.899 
then be kind of like a secret entrance I
think<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.290> be<00:02:21.379> pretty<00:02:21.560> cool<00:02:21.769> but<00:02:22.519> like<00:02:22.670> over

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
think to be pretty cool but like over

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.250 
think to be pretty cool but like over
here<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.150> can<00:02:23.299> see<00:02:23.510> I'm<00:02:23.599> doing<00:02:23.870> some<00:02:24.049> kind<00:02:24.200> of

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
here you can see I'm doing some kind of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.110 
here you can see I'm doing some kind of
like<00:02:24.409> arches<00:02:24.799> on<00:02:24.920> these<00:02:25.069> walls<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.670> don't<00:02:26.060> know

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
like arches on these walls I don't know

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.520 
like arches on these walls I don't know
if<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.269> want<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.450> continue<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:26.930> all<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.409> way

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
if I want to continue that all the way

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.170 
if I want to continue that all the way
around<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:28.129> was<00:02:28.519> thinking<00:02:28.730> about<00:02:28.760> making<00:02:28.969> this

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
around I was thinking about making this

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.640 
around I was thinking about making this
like<00:02:29.329> a<00:02:29.359> big<00:02:29.599> media<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.049> a<00:02:30.109> big<00:02:30.319> courtyard

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
like a big media like a big courtyard

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.979 
like a big media like a big courtyard
down<00:02:30.950> here<00:02:31.189> but<00:02:31.849> I'm<00:02:32.000> realizing<00:02:32.299> now<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.629> the

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
down here but I'm realizing now that the

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.530 
down here but I'm realizing now that the
ceiling<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.590> pretty<00:02:34.209> someone's<00:02:35.209> made<00:02:35.420> that

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
ceiling is pretty someone's made that

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.380 
ceiling is pretty someone's made that
night<00:02:35.629> n<00:02:35.810> that's<00:02:36.049> annoying<00:02:37.150> but<00:02:38.150> what<00:02:38.299> I'm

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
night n that's annoying but what I'm

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.849 
night n that's annoying but what I'm
realizing<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.200> ceiling<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:39.829> not

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
realizing is that this ceiling is not

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.500 
realizing is that this ceiling is not
necessarily<00:02:40.549> high<00:02:40.819> enough<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.209> make<00:02:41.359> it

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
necessarily high enough to make it

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.580 
necessarily high enough to make it
actually<00:02:41.659> work<00:02:41.840> now<00:02:42.109> it's<00:02:42.200> like<00:02:42.260> i<00:02:42.379> wouldnt<00:02:42.530> be

know we actually recently added a bunch
of<00:02:56.720> new<00:02:56.840> people<00:02:57.280> potato<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.340> think<00:02:58.609> he<00:02:58.819> I'm<00:02:59.510> not

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.860 
showing people add no we added a good
amount<00:03:01.099> because<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.519> think<00:03:01.879> we<00:03:02.060> got<00:03:02.090> like<00:03:02.450> 15

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
amount because I think we got like 15

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.270 
amount because I think we got like 15
out<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.019> 30<00:03:03.319> people<00:03:03.500> on<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.829> server<00:03:04.040> right<00:03:04.159> now

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
out of 30 people on the server right now

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.860 
out of 30 people on the server right now
not<00:03:04.459> 30<00:03:04.669> people<00:03:04.939> total<00:03:05.209> but<00:03:05.299> I<00:03:05.329> think<00:03:05.569> you<00:03:05.720> can

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
not 30 people total but I think you can

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.539 
not 30 people total but I think you can
only<00:03:05.989> have<00:03:06.200> like<00:03:06.409> 30<00:03:06.650> people<00:03:06.829> online<00:03:07.069> at<00:03:07.370> once

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
only have like 30 people online at once

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.520 
only have like 30 people online at once
otherwise<00:03:08.389> you<00:03:08.540> can't<00:03:08.750> get<00:03:08.900> in<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.439> think

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
otherwise you can't get in and I think

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.899 
otherwise you can't get in and I think
this<00:03:09.799> is<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.040> most<00:03:10.069> people<00:03:10.489> i've<00:03:10.609> seen<00:03:10.790> on

like<00:04:02.510> it's<00:04:02.750> too<00:04:03.049> far<00:04:03.409> to<00:04:03.620> really<00:04:03.979> see<00:04:04.159> what's

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
like it's too far to really see what's

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.250 
like it's too far to really see what's
going<00:04:04.579> on<00:04:04.699> so<00:04:05.239> when<00:04:05.419> the<00:04:05.659> camera<00:04:05.930> guys<00:04:06.079> up

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
going on so when the camera guys up

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.569 
going on so when the camera guys up
there<00:04:06.439> and<00:04:06.620> I'm<00:04:06.739> like<00:04:06.949> building<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.370> walls

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
there and I'm like building the walls

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.399 
there and I'm like building the walls
over<00:04:07.790> here<00:04:07.909> you<00:04:08.060> can't<00:04:08.329> really<00:04:08.780> see<00:04:08.930> what's

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
over here you can't really see what's

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.559 
over here you can't really see what's
happening<00:04:09.799> so<00:04:10.099> it<00:04:10.609> just<00:04:10.879> is<00:04:11.000> kind<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.359> I<00:04:11.540> mean

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
happening so it just is kind of I mean

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.149 
happening so it just is kind of I mean
since<00:04:12.169> you<00:04:12.290> can't<00:04:12.470> really<00:04:12.620> see<00:04:12.709> what's<00:04:12.949> going

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
since you can't really see what's going

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.259 
since you can't really see what's going
on<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.430> can<00:04:13.549> only<00:04:13.669> really<00:04:13.759> tell<00:04:14.120> what's

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
on you can only really tell what's

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.819 
on you can only really tell what's
happening<00:04:14.629> when<00:04:14.750> my<00:04:14.870> guys<00:04:15.049> in<00:04:15.259> this<00:04:15.439> corner

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
happening when my guys in this corner

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.830 
happening when my guys in this corner
over<00:04:15.889> here<00:04:16.009> so<00:04:16.699> i<00:04:16.729> think<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:17.299> know<00:04:17.419> as<00:04:17.690> I

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
over here so i think that you know as I

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.120 
over here so i think that you know as I
build<00:04:18.109> kind<00:04:18.349> of<00:04:18.440> smaller<00:04:18.680> buildings<00:04:19.009> like

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
build kind of smaller buildings like

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.219 
build kind of smaller buildings like
either<00:04:19.280> on<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.549> basement<00:04:19.970> or<00:04:20.060> maybe<00:04:20.959> if<00:04:21.109> we

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
either on the basement or maybe if we

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.159 
either on the basement or maybe if we
build<00:04:21.470> on<00:04:21.889> kind<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.659> this<00:04:23.659> floor<00:04:23.990> right

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
build on kind of the this floor right

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.570 
build on kind of the this floor right
here<00:04:24.200> I<00:04:24.440> think<00:04:24.590> they<00:04:24.919> would<00:04:25.039> I<00:04:25.190> think<00:04:25.430> they'd

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
here I think they would I think they'd

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.530 
here I think they would I think they'd
show<00:04:25.760> up<00:04:25.789> pretty<00:04:26.029> well<00:04:26.120> but<00:04:26.870> it

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
show up pretty well but it

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.640 
show up pretty well but it
it's<00:04:27.630> really<00:04:27.840> going<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:27.990> do<00:04:28.140> women<00:04:28.350> in<00:04:28.470> based

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
it's really going to do women in based

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.350 
it's really going to do women in based
on<00:04:28.830> just<00:04:28.890> that<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.490> know<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.700> massive<00:04:30.150> size

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
on just that you know the massive size

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.270 
on just that you know the massive size
of<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:30.750> place<00:04:30.930> what<00:04:31.890> we<00:04:32.010> can<00:04:32.160> actually

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
of this place what we can actually

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.580 
of this place what we can actually
record<00:04:32.760> or<00:04:33.030> not<00:04:33.660> really<00:04:33.900> but<00:04:34.140> what<00:04:34.290> I<00:04:34.320> can

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
record or not really but what I can

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.630 
record or not really but what I can
actually<00:04:34.830> record<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.250> what<00:04:35.370> will<00:04:35.520> actually

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
actually record and what will actually

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.250 
actually record and what will actually
look<00:04:35.940> nice<00:04:36.180> when<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:36.510> even<00:04:36.780> when<00:04:36.900> it's<00:04:37.050> sped

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
look nice when it's even when it's sped

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.020 
look nice when it's even when it's sped
up<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.500> know<00:04:37.590> so<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.220> think<00:04:38.490> most<00:04:38.670> of<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.880> time

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
up you know so I think most of the time

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.820 
up you know so I think most of the time
reps<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.390> from<00:04:39.540> now<00:04:39.660> on<00:04:39.780> will<00:04:39.930> be<00:04:39.960> just<00:04:40.500> of<00:04:40.650> me

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
reps is from now on will be just of me

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.080 
reps is from now on will be just of me
building<00:04:41.130> stuff<00:04:41.370> on<00:04:41.520> I<00:04:41.670> have<00:04:41.760> like<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:41.940> little

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
building stuff on I have like a little

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.700 
building stuff on I have like a little
private<00:04:42.480> server<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:42.840> can<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.230> put<00:04:43.380> me<00:04:43.560> in

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
private server that I can just put me in

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.380 
private server that I can just put me in
my<00:04:43.830> camera<00:04:44.160> guy<00:04:44.310> on<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.730> then<00:04:44.820> that<00:04:45.000> works<00:04:45.180> out

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
my camera guy on and then that works out

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.700 
my camera guy on and then that works out
and<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:45.990> can<00:04:46.020> just<00:04:46.230> pretty<00:04:46.410> much<00:04:46.500> build

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
and I can just pretty much build

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.990 
and I can just pretty much build
whatever<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:47.040> want<00:04:47.250> just<00:04:47.430> put<00:04:47.550> on<00:04:47.640> creative

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
whatever I want just put on creative

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.820 
whatever I want just put on creative
mode<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.330> go<00:04:48.390> crazy<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:49.290> I<00:04:49.320> think<00:04:49.440> that's<00:04:49.680> what

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
mode and go crazy so I think that's what

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.620 
mode and go crazy so I think that's what
most<00:04:50.040> of<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.280> time<00:04:50.430> lapses<00:04:50.730> will<00:04:50.910> be<00:04:51.060> of<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.450> I

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
most of the time lapses will be of and I

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.790 
most of the time lapses will be of and I
mean<00:04:51.840> that<00:04:51.960> shouldn't<00:04:52.200> be<00:04:52.260> too<00:04:52.290> bad<00:04:52.410> for<00:04:52.590> you

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
mean that shouldn't be too bad for you

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.750 
mean that shouldn't be too bad for you
guys<00:04:53.010> I<00:04:53.220> think<00:04:53.400> it'll<00:04:53.520> be<00:04:53.640> pretty

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
guys I think it'll be pretty
