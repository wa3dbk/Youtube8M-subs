okay so this is the contraption that we
use<00:00:03.810> there's<00:00:04.799> some<00:00:04.950> rollers<00:00:05.430> on<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.609> bottom

which<00:00:07.379> touch<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.670> ground<00:00:10.610> that's<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> car

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
which touch the ground that's so the car

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.089 
which touch the ground that's so the car
can<00:00:12.480> with<00:00:12.780> warm<00:00:12.990> while<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.320> wheel<00:00:13.799> actually

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
can with warm while that wheel actually

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.769 
can with warm while that wheel actually
sits<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:15.059> here<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.690> these<00:00:15.839> two<00:00:17.600> on<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.720> one

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
sits in here on these two on this one

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.500 
sits in here on these two on this one
and<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> one<00:00:19.230> over<00:00:19.560> there<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:21.180> wheel<00:00:21.330> can

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
and the one over there and the wheel can

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.070 
and the one over there and the wheel can
spin<00:00:21.720> freely<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:25.279> yeah<00:00:26.869> this<00:00:27.869> thing<00:00:28.080> slide

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
spin freely so yeah this thing slide

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.049 
spin freely so yeah this thing slide
though<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.590> pretty<00:00:31.710> cool

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
though it's pretty cool

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.250 
though it's pretty cool
okay<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.629> we've<00:00:34.110> got<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.980> car<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:36.260> these

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
okay so we've got the car on these

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.770 
okay so we've got the car on these
rollers<00:00:37.769> so<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.789> rear<00:00:39.000> wheels<00:00:39.180> are<00:00:39.360> not

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
rollers so the rear wheels are not

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.869 
rollers so the rear wheels are not
contacting<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.010> transferring<00:00:41.550> power<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
contacting and not transferring power to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.130 
contacting and not transferring power to
the<00:00:41.940> ground<00:00:42.149> we're<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.050> what

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the ground we're going to see what

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:54.320 
the ground we're going to see what
happens

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.189 

easy<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.400> even
