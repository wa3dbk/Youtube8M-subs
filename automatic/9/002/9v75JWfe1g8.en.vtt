00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.920
 Upper tail gate 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.030
 It is this black when it comes to where the vaccine is 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.829
 That graveyard- 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.749
 There are 16 places in the United States. 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:18.560
 It looks like Nomi g. 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:21.119
 It is a driver of flash 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.890
 I think that is a ban on the eco recipe test 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.939
 Possible with this driver 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.499
 I sometimes go around 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.339
 But it is really effective 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.699
 Like this 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.670
 It is that drama It is a little different form when you do inspection 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.440
 I think you will understand that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.720
 There is also a normal plus here 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.510
 Here 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.610
 Another one 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.040
 Can you see it jumping out? 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.880
 In a word that this is a small child 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.100
 that 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.440
 Range Rover is quite rocky rock drive 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.450
 That gu is used a lot 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.470
 Mekore this time Bahama probably most have a riverbank 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.240
 I think 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.240
 It is rude on the other hand, but loosens with this 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.540
 Now little by little 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.810
 Easy to see 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.690
 status 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.690
 The truth is that 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.630
 home 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.630
 If you feel this result horse 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.590
 This fact is that per clamp of that brake 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.760
 However, is it here? 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.980
 Do you see high 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.330
 These actuators 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.750
 It is also confirmed whether this is after the war 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.100
 What you need to do 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.100
 For example, if you ask 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.330
 I heard it 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.580
 now 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.580
 After all 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.730
 From big 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.849
 Iwase Masaka 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.109
 One side 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.599
 It is something 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.599
 I think it is okay for the station chief 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.309
 It was said that it was domestic 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:22.789
 It is the problem 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.649
 I will say whether the country can use electricity or not 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:27.509
 It is not a failure or this 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:28.689
 The actuator 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.760
 Identify that kind of bottle container that you are afraid of 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.759
 is needed 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.929
 Then if this exceeds the actuator 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:41.899
 Replace the actuator 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:45.169
 It was another reason but the king also said that this buchimei 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:45.949
 It will be a plan
