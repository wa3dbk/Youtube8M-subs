 how to recover elastic hair and I 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.210
 I'll teach the schedule method. 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.580
 It 's been a couple of years since I 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.450
 I saw the way I think I do the root 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.250
 so I have already followed the capillary schedule 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.220
 when I got trampoline because 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.560
 my hair was painted black dell was 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.359
 discoloration excluding discoloration 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.369
 seven times to reach the podium nothing 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.650
 new schedule for those who do not 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.430
 know is a treatment step that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.059
 consists of three steps that are they 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.530
 hydration nutrition and reconstruction 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.989
 hydration it is used to replace water 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.480
 loss of hair and leaves hair more 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.280
 soft and ready to receive the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.340
 nutrients and vitamins 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.710
 the nutrition step serves to restore the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.250
 fat wire reconstruction step 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.860
 to restore the mass lost in the hair 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.930
 good elastic is always good you follow the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.719
 complete schedule so you will 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.930
 recover your hair faster it goes 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.729
 recover very well if you look at the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.939
 google you will find thousands and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.130
 thousands of schedules each person does 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.400
 the way I'm going to teach you 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.590
 The way I do and the masks I 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.420
 use for each of the steps 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.580
 and you do not have to follow the way 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.659
 I do, of course you do the way you do. 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.310
 find it better 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.159
 it's only important that you know the component 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.100
 each of the masks so that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.380
 has a correct result then it is the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.979
 next we will make a schedule 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.020
 for a month and in one month we go 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.450
 treat three days a week 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 so you choose my case three days 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.950
 I'll choose Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday. 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.619
 So we'll do it like that in the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.030
 first day of the first week and 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.180
 hydration 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.430
 on the second day of the first week 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.719
 and on the third day of the first 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:04.369
 week in the second week and 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:08.250

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.660
 nutrition and reconstruction, I know that 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.480
 difficult to understand but I will leave here

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.760
