these<00:00:54.960> pieces<00:00:55.920> these<00:00:56.399> metal<00:00:56.850> pieces<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.420> go

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
these pieces these metal pieces that go

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.650 
these pieces these metal pieces that go
through<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.550> part<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.570> have

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
through this part here and then you have

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.660 
through this part here and then you have
a<00:01:00.719> tee<00:01:00.899> section<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.250> snaps

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
a tee section here and it all just snaps

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.700 
a tee section here and it all just snaps
together<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.420> goes<00:01:03.629> together<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.170> 45

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
together and goes together in about 45

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.020 
together and goes together in about 45
minutes<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.390> put<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.689> pool<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.369> on<00:01:08.369> May

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.760 
chlorine stay and high and also it got
up<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.619> 100<00:01:58.920> degrees<00:01:59.000> last<00:02:00.000> week<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.770> this

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
up to 100 degrees last week and this

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.730 
up to 100 degrees last week and this
week<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.779 

so<00:02:05.729> that's<00:02:05.970> going<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.210> make<00:02:06.570> some<00:02:06.810> algae<00:02:07.789> but

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
so that's going to make some algae but

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.490 
so that's going to make some algae but
we've<00:02:09.090> got<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.420> all<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.660> chemicals<00:02:10.110> back<00:02:10.289> in

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
we've got it all the chemicals back in

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.640 
we've got it all the chemicals back in
it<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.830> took<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.340> few<00:02:11.550> days<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.500> get<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
it and it took just a few days to get it

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.800 
it and it took just a few days to get it
in<00:02:13.980> order<00:02:14.310> it's<00:02:14.880> still<00:02:15.060> pretty<00:02:15.180> cloudy<00:02:15.510> right

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
in order it's still pretty cloudy right

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.940 
in order it's still pretty cloudy right
now<00:02:15.870> normally<00:02:16.350> you're<00:02:16.500> supposed<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.770> be<00:02:16.890> able

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
now normally you're supposed to be able

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.860 
now normally you're supposed to be able
to<00:02:17.069> see<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:18.600> bottom<00:02:18.750> but<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:21.239> could<00:02:21.720> just

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
to see the bottom but I could just

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.290 
to see the bottom but I could just
barely<00:02:21.989> see<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.410> right<00:02:22.590> now<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.060> pools

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
barely see it right now so the pools

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.330 
barely see it right now so the pools
held<00:02:27.900> up<00:02:28.080> well<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:30.319> we<00:02:31.319> did<00:02:31.470> have<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.680> leak<00:02:32.220> in

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
held up well and we did have a leak in

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.190 
held up well and we did have a leak in
the<00:02:32.430> pool<00:02:32.610> when<00:02:32.790> we<00:02:32.880> first<00:02:33.120> got<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.810> I

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
the pool when we first got it and I

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.559 
the pool when we first got it and I
patched<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.550> haven't<00:02:35.970> had<00:02:36.060> any<00:02:36.209> other

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
patched that and I haven't had any other

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.910 
patched that and I haven't had any other
trouble<00:02:37.200> with<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.370> that's<00:02:38.580> good<00:02:39.920> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
trouble with that so that's good and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.370 
trouble with that so that's good and
another<00:02:41.850> thing<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.209> we<00:02:42.420> haven't<00:02:42.630> covered<00:02:43.140> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
another thing is we haven't covered the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.030 
another thing is we haven't covered the
pool<00:02:44.000> because<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:46.350> one<00:02:46.530> time<00:02:46.709> we<00:02:46.800> did<00:02:47.010> it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
pool because the one time we did it

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.860 
pool because the one time we did it
rained<00:02:47.459> quite<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.790> bit<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.209> cover<00:02:48.660> just

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
rained quite a bit and the cover just

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
rained quite a bit and the cover just
went<00:02:49.050> down<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.350> bottom<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.769> pool

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
went down to the bottom of the pool

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.580 
went down to the bottom of the pool
anyway<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:51.780> you're<00:02:51.900> supposed<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.200> keep<00:02:52.380> it

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
anyway so but you're supposed to keep it

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.160 
anyway so but you're supposed to keep it
covered<00:02:52.860> most<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.430> time<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:54.810> keeps<00:02:55.019> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
covered most of the time it keeps the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.110 
covered most of the time it keeps the
Sun<00:02:55.410> off<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.830> but<00:02:56.130> we<00:02:56.280> don't<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.790> quite

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
Sun off of it but we don't have is quite

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.000 
Sun off of it but we don't have is quite
a<00:02:57.239> hot<00:02:57.450> that's<00:02:58.110> how<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.350> temperatures<00:02:58.830> here<00:02:58.980> in

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
a hot that's how to temperatures here in

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.699 
a hot that's how to temperatures here in
Iowa<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.580> might<00:02:59.730> have<00:03:00.470> down<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> narrow

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
Iowa that you might have down a narrow

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.190 
Iowa that you might have down a narrow
zone<00:03:01.950> or<00:03:02.160> something<00:03:02.190> like<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.850> where<00:03:03.200> you

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
zone or something like that where you

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.160 
zone or something like that where you
know<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.410> just<00:03:04.500> going<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.739> totally<00:03:06.050> fade<00:03:07.050> it

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
know it's just going to totally fade it

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.580 
know it's just going to totally fade it
out

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
out

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.699 
out
so<00:03:08.459> here<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:09.079> yeah<00:03:10.079> we're<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.290> leaving<00:03:10.650> it

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
so here it's yeah we're just leaving it

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.199 
so here it's yeah we're just leaving it
uncovered

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.440 

so<00:03:15.310> we<00:03:16.310> did<00:03:16.519> do<00:03:18.219> stepping<00:03:19.219> stones<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.969> solar

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
so we did do stepping stones and solar

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.479 
so we did do stepping stones and solar
lights<00:03:20.750> all<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.019> way<00:03:21.109> around<00:03:21.469> and<00:03:21.709> that's

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
lights all the way around and that's

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.720 
lights all the way around and that's
pretty<00:03:22.700> nice<00:03:22.969> for<00:03:23.420> at<00:03:23.510> night<00:03:23.719> and<00:03:24.609> they<00:03:25.609> also

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
pretty nice for at night and they also

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.160 
pretty nice for at night and they also
sell<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:27.909> night<00:03:28.909> light<00:03:29.120> for<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.359> pool<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:30.049> you

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
sell a night light for the pool that you

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.369 
sell a night light for the pool that you
can<00:03:30.319> just<00:03:31.299> stick<00:03:32.299> to<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.540> side<00:03:32.750> with<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.930> magnet

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
can just stick to the side with a magnet

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.860 
can just stick to the side with a magnet
and<00:03:34.120> we're<00:03:35.120> thinking<00:03:35.359> about<00:03:35.450> maybe<00:03:35.750> doing

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
and we're thinking about maybe doing

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.530 
and we're thinking about maybe doing
that<00:03:36.109> next<00:03:36.379> summer<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:37.040> we<00:03:38.030> could<00:03:38.150> set<00:03:38.359> it<00:03:38.389> on

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
that next summer and we could set it on

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.360 
that next summer and we could set it on
a<00:03:38.569> timer<00:03:38.870> for<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.290> few<00:03:39.500> hours<00:03:39.560> every<00:03:39.950> night<00:03:39.980> to

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
a timer for a few hours every night to

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.270 
a timer for a few hours every night to
have<00:03:40.870> have<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:41.989> run<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:45.170> ladder<00:03:45.379> seems<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.189> be

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
have have it run the ladder seems to be

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.129 
have have it run the ladder seems to be
a<00:03:46.310> little<00:03:46.489> bit<00:03:46.639> more<00:03:46.849> rickety<00:03:47.359> than<00:03:47.750> when<00:03:48.019> we

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
a little bit more rickety than when we

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.530 
a little bit more rickety than when we
first<00:03:48.319> got<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.709> but<00:03:49.340> it's<00:03:49.489> still<00:03:49.609> holding<00:03:50.299> up

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
first got it but it's still holding up

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.759 
first got it but it's still holding up
nice<00:03:50.750> but<00:03:51.079> it's<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.680> little<00:03:52.340> shake<00:03:52.579> or<00:03:52.909> shaky

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
nice but it's a little shake or shaky

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.970 
nice but it's a little shake or shaky
we've<00:03:54.769> got<00:03:54.919> two<00:03:55.359> blocks<00:03:56.359> under<00:03:56.750> each<00:03:56.959> of<00:03:57.799> the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
we've got two blocks under each of the

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.369 
we've got two blocks under each of the
legs<00:03:58.159> there<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:58.819> then<00:03:59.090> we've<00:03:59.239> got<00:03:59.389> a<00:03:59.450> mat<00:03:59.750> on

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
legs there and then we've got a mat on

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.080 
legs there and then we've got a mat on
the<00:04:00.590> inside<00:04:00.919> in<00:04:01.129> here<00:04:01.599> underneath<00:04:02.599> the<00:04:02.959> ladder

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
the inside in here underneath the ladder

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.970 
the inside in here underneath the ladder
because<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.419> it<00:04:06.079> looks<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.439> same<00:04:06.680> on<00:04:06.889> the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
because the it looks the same on the

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.580 
because the it looks the same on the
inside<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:08.810> would<00:04:09.109> think<00:04:09.260> that'd<00:04:09.439> be

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
inside and I would think that'd be

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.670 
inside and I would think that'd be
pretty<00:04:09.620> hard<00:04:10.010> on<00:04:10.099> the<00:04:10.219> liner<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:10.700> we<00:04:11.439> put<00:04:12.439> a<00:04:12.469> mat

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
pretty hard on the liner so we put a mat

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.399 
pretty hard on the liner so we put a mat
in<00:04:12.709> between<00:04:16.329> so<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.660> setup<00:04:17.870> time<00:04:18.139> here<00:04:18.349> is

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
in between so the setup time here is

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.890 
in between so the setup time here is
about<00:04:18.590> 45<00:04:19.039> minutes<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.639> tear<00:04:20.150> downs<00:04:20.389> probably

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
about 45 minutes and tear downs probably

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.670 
about 45 minutes and tear downs probably
bout<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.109> same<00:04:22.240> keep<00:04:23.240> your<00:04:23.419> chlorine<00:04:23.690> up<00:04:23.960> test

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
bout the same keep your chlorine up test

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.050 
bout the same keep your chlorine up test
it<00:04:24.889> once<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.250> week<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:26.830> that's<00:04:27.970> probably<00:04:28.970> the

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
it once a week and that's probably the

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.460 
it once a week and that's probably the
main<00:04:29.180> thing<00:04:29.240> for<00:04:29.449> keeping<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:29.930> pretty<00:04:30.110> clear

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
main thing for keeping it pretty clear

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.820 
main thing for keeping it pretty clear
and<00:04:31.599> you<00:04:32.599> know

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
and you know

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.740 
and you know

[Applause]

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.510 
[Applause]
test<00:04:36.750> your<00:04:36.900> pH<00:04:40.040> and<00:04:41.040> what's<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.370> other<00:04:41.430> one

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
test your pH and what's the other one

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.480 
test your pH and what's the other one
alkalinity<00:04:42.800> those<00:04:43.800> are<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.100> three<00:04:44.280> you<00:04:44.400> got

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
alkalinity those are the three you got

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.960 
alkalinity those are the three you got
to<00:04:44.610> look<00:04:44.699> for<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:46.530> must<00:04:46.979> admit<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.310> was<00:04:47.669> just<00:04:47.820> kind

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
to look for I must admit I was just kind

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.000 
to look for I must admit I was just kind
of<00:04:48.000> winging<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.449> to<00:04:48.810> start<00:04:49.080> with<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.560> the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
of winging it to start with and the

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.620 
of winging it to start with and the
chlorine<00:04:50.280> was<00:04:50.490> actually<00:04:50.790> pretty<00:04:50.940> low<00:04:51.180> the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
chlorine was actually pretty low the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.260 
chlorine was actually pretty low the
last<00:04:51.840> two<00:04:51.990> months<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:54.270> it<00:04:54.570> might<00:04:54.750> have

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
last two months and so it might have

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.520 
last two months and so it might have
been<00:04:57.270> part<00:04:57.510> of<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.690> reason<00:04:57.930> why<00:04:58.020> I<00:04:58.050> got<00:04:58.260> a

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
been part of the reason why I got a

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.880 
been part of the reason why I got a
little<00:04:58.919> green<00:05:00.080> here's<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.199> pump<00:05:01.440> here

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
little green here's the pump here

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.450 
little green here's the pump here

and<00:05:08.390> we've<00:05:08.570> had<00:05:08.690> it<00:05:08.870> you<00:05:09.110> can<00:05:09.260> if<00:05:09.500> you<00:05:09.530> turn<00:05:09.800> it

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
and we've had it you can if you turn it

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.200 
and we've had it you can if you turn it
put<00:05:10.160> it<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.400> left<00:05:10.430> you<00:05:10.790> can<00:05:10.910> run<00:05:11.030> it<00:05:11.150> on

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
put it to the left you can run it on

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.610 
put it to the left you can run it on
constant<00:05:11.810> or<00:05:11.960> if<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.110> put<00:05:12.260> it<00:05:12.320> to<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.410> right

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
constant or if you put it to the right

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.160 
constant or if you put it to the right
you<00:05:12.740> can<00:05:12.800> time<00:05:13.190> it<00:05:13.370> for<00:05:14.120> two<00:05:14.300> four<00:05:14.660> six<00:05:14.960> eight

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
you can time it for two four six eight

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.500 
you can time it for two four six eight
or<00:05:15.440> twelve<00:05:15.680> hours<00:05:15.800> and<00:05:16.220> right<00:05:17.150> now<00:05:17.270> we<00:05:17.330> just

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
or twelve hours and right now we just

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.450 
or twelve hours and right now we just
have<00:05:17.720> it<00:05:17.840> on<00:05:17.900> constant<00:05:18.680> running<00:05:18.920> until<00:05:19.400> the

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
have it on constant running until the

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.770 
have it on constant running until the
pool<00:05:20.300> gets<00:05:20.510> as<00:05:21.350> clear<00:05:21.710> as<00:05:21.770> we<00:05:21.920> can<00:05:22.070> get<00:05:22.250> it<00:05:22.780> so

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
pool gets as clear as we can get it so

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.870 
pool gets as clear as we can get it so
we'll<00:05:23.900> probably<00:05:24.020> run<00:05:24.260> it<00:05:24.410> maybe<00:05:24.890> a<00:05:25.160> couple

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
we'll probably run it maybe a couple

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.590 
we'll probably run it maybe a couple
more<00:05:26.000> days<00:05:26.950> but<00:05:27.950> it's<00:05:28.250> really<00:05:28.670> fun<00:05:29.030> and<00:05:29.390> I

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
more days but it's really fun and I

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.910 
more days but it's really fun and I
would<00:05:29.720> rate<00:05:30.200> this<00:05:30.380> pool<00:05:30.680> a<00:05:30.980> 10<00:05:31.460> out<00:05:31.580> of<00:05:31.610> a<00:05:31.760> 10

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
would rate this pool a 10 out of a 10

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.310 
would rate this pool a 10 out of a 10
because<00:05:34.120> what<00:05:35.120> I<00:05:35.150> found<00:05:35.360> out<00:05:35.600> is<00:05:35.780> you<00:05:36.170> can

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
because what I found out is you can

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.810 
because what I found out is you can
really<00:05:36.500> get<00:05:36.590> some<00:05:36.890> pretty<00:05:37.070> good<00:05:37.220> exercise<00:05:37.670> in

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
really get some pretty good exercise in

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.090 
really get some pretty good exercise in
here<00:05:37.970> I'm<00:05:38.090> a<00:05:38.120> I<00:05:38.600> usually<00:05:39.410> like<00:05:39.560> to<00:05:39.590> run<00:05:39.890> about

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
here I'm a I usually like to run about

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.510 
here I'm a I usually like to run about
three<00:05:40.370> or<00:05:40.490> four<00:05:40.670> miles<00:05:40.850> a<00:05:41.000> week<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:41.860> I<00:05:42.860> have<00:05:43.430> in

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
three or four miles a week and I have in

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.130 
three or four miles a week and I have in
this<00:05:43.640> pool<00:05:43.940> I<00:05:44.150> haven't<00:05:44.420> had<00:05:44.510> to<00:05:44.660> run<00:05:44.840> at<00:05:44.960> all

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
this pool I haven't had to run at all

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.490 
this pool I haven't had to run at all
all<00:05:45.470> summer<00:05:45.980> and<00:05:46.250> I<00:05:47.180> you<00:05:47.690> can<00:05:47.840> actually<00:05:47.960> get<00:05:48.320> a

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
all summer and I you can actually get a

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.810 
all summer and I you can actually get a
lot<00:05:48.710> of<00:05:48.830> exercise<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:49.250> there's<00:05:49.610> so<00:05:49.730> many

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
lot of exercise and there's so many

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.390 
lot of exercise and there's so many
movements<00:05:50.330> you<00:05:50.450> can<00:05:50.480> do<00:05:50.750> and<00:05:51.040> you<00:05:52.040> don't<00:05:52.250> get

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
movements you can do and you don't get

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.500 
movements you can do and you don't get
any<00:05:52.550> of<00:05:52.730> the<00:05:54.520> jarring<00:05:55.520> on<00:05:55.670> your<00:05:56.030> joints<00:05:56.360> and

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
any of the jarring on your joints and

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.480 
any of the jarring on your joints and
stuff<00:05:56.690> so<00:05:57.080> I<00:05:57.290> would<00:05:57.590> highly<00:05:57.860> recommend<00:05:57.890> this

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
stuff so I would highly recommend this

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.090 
stuff so I would highly recommend this
for<00:05:58.760> exercise<00:05:59.420> just<00:06:00.140> swim<00:06:00.320> around<00:06:00.440> in<00:06:00.650> circles

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
for exercise just swim around in circles

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.530 
for exercise just swim around in circles
or<00:06:01.280> swim<00:06:01.490> back<00:06:01.640> and<00:06:01.790> forth<00:06:02.030> you<00:06:02.210> can<00:06:02.360> back

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
or swim back and forth you can back

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.960 
or swim back and forth you can back
float<00:06:02.900> you<00:06:03.650> can<00:06:03.770> do<00:06:03.920> anything<00:06:04.160> you<00:06:04.640> can<00:06:04.670> hang

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
float you can do anything you can hang

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.720 
float you can do anything you can hang
on<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.210> side<00:06:05.390> sorted<00:06:05.900> and<00:06:06.170> do<00:06:06.980> the<00:06:07.130> pedal<00:06:07.640> with

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
on the side sorted and do the pedal with

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.420 
on the side sorted and do the pedal with
your<00:06:07.880> legs<00:06:08.710> so<00:06:09.710> it's<00:06:09.860> really<00:06:10.010> cool<00:06:10.280> for

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
your legs so it's really cool for

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.010 
your legs so it's really cool for
exercising<00:06:13.180> so<00:06:14.180> I<00:06:14.210> definitely<00:06:14.720> recommend

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
exercising so I definitely recommend

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.620 
exercising so I definitely recommend
this<00:06:15.200> pool<00:06:15.470> we<00:06:16.340> got<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.610> soft<00:06:16.820> target<00:06:17.210> comm

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
this pool we got the soft target comm
