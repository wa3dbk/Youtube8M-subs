best have ever put skates on China has

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.090 
best have ever put skates on China has
thousands<00:07:11.390> of<00:07:11.540> juniors<00:07:12.080> waiting<00:07:12.620> to<00:07:12.800> clump<00:07:12.980> in

thousands of juniors waiting to clump in
the<00:07:13.190> ranks<00:07:13.490> so<00:07:13.670> there's<00:07:14.360> a<00:07:14.420> lot<00:07:14.570> of<00:07:14.690> turnover

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
the ranks so there's a lot of turnover

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.690 
the ranks so there's a lot of turnover

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:18.950 
balanced again ethanol or I guess we'll

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.150
