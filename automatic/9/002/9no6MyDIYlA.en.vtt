00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.900
 we go immediately to open the package 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.610
 I tell you right away that this is a Mr. 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.290
 then we'll go and see

 white version with front frame 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.530
 white otherwise there is also black 16 gigabytes 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.360
 of non-expandable internal memory 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.220
 global firmware then above ie 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.980
 firmware means this means 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.549
 that we will basically have the updates first 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.490
 firmware dedicated to clarification at 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.569
 global landscape is not the film that is 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.249
 the international one 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.749
 no problem whatsoever when installing 

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:15.450
 the play store but I had no doubts 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:18.149
 in the black version the back frame 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.700
 frame is the same as this kummer 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.039
 only the front frame then 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.009
 white here it is black otherwise 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.170
 you will find that clearly all black 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.109
 in the package we find minimalism 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.609
 of meizu we find a little book that is 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.509
 this one that we don't need practically 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.929
 to nothing 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.420
 we find micro usb data cable for 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.819
 recharge our smartphone as well 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.590
 to exchange data admit small the 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.069
 our computer we find the pin 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.899
 to extract the two nano informed sims 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.939
 there is no expansion of memory there 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.119
 I repeat we find below the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.060
 wall charger in non format 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.560
 European do not worry because he is big 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.829
 shop will put you in the box 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.990
 the adapter to adapt this neon if 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.450
 moretti and then we find nothing else 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.390
 inside this box of meditations there 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.730
 they are few there is nothing else than that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.940
 that you saw in the video 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.690
 unboxing we immediately unlock the phone 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.340
 look at the cd call i know that not 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.450
 it is a thaci of why it is not clearly 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.570
 an iphone 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.540
 but in short the functionality but 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.460
 above all the precision of this cd o 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.740
 better than this unlock sensor 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.390
 really bad is digital 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.220
 incredible we are at iphone levels 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.090
 s6 according to me it was not precise how 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.240
 this mx5 instead he really 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.090
 look at the precision really 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.030
 amazing how months have worked on 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.500
 this fingerprint sensor 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.220
 I put the phone a little closer 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.320
 the display is a full hd so we have 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.010
 we don't have the two kappa less bad I would say 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.900
 I have a very good super panel 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.510
 amoled and full hd so super amoled 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.070
 of the first super amoled if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.910
 months very much within his 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.270
 device seems to me and I would not say 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.490
 castronerie if I said so I apologize 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.190
 right away with the most fans of the brand 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.010
 this is the frame construction 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.660
 perimeter of this device on the 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.630
 right part on and off 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.960
 as well as volume rocker part 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.210
 top with the jack for 35 mm the 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.400
 there is no door to the second microphone 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.250
 infrared the classic camera are 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.500
 the megapixel actresses with the single led 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.380
 flash on the left side we find 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.860
 clearly the inclusion of the two dwarfs 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.620
 sim 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.870
 here is the fingerprint sensor looked at 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.480
 well with a prolonged tap you go to 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.549
 lock the display just rest 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.129
 see how even my thumb is not 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.230
 one is a natural grip though 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.060
 let's say in some phones when 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.640
 let's put the thumb so it doesn't unblock 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.150
 finally a sensor that works at 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.190
 better 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.319
