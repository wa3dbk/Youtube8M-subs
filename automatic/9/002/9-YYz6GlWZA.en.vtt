00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.070
 also just for you of course again 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.360
 upload videos before I start 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.030
 I want you with a real commentary 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.130
 just let me know that I'm going to try to 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.879
 as long as possible any video that until now 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.710
 to start uploading in 1080p to render 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.820
 so if you had good internet 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.929
 if you just had a good computer 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.730
 then you can watch this video 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.469
 in 1080p 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.510
 so with quality for a moment and then 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.480
 you can watch it in the best 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.999
 that's your fat piss mark quality 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.559
 well that pluck the abyss is a pastors 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.440
 and 60 cents game play where I play on the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.760
 a12 i have i suggest him get up ex and still 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.579
 once 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.199
 and mo penetration bullets then there are 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.819
 tess knew that means if you do 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.920
 for example, a maniac before you 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:03.929
 walk or if you put a set on the floor 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.940
 that you get him very quickly with but 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.399
 so a few bullets is broken 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.140
 those m on penetration bullets I do not know 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.600
 exactly how it's called a call or 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.939
 duty ghost who will help you with this 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
 well you get the media or real 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.630
 100,000 goals against you and you 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.310
 do not want to stay you stay 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.170
 just broken within a few balls 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.750
 you don't have much else 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 to state or describe the weapon 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.210
 I that if you ate that on your arms 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.829
 attachment 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.659
 that that dermis also goes up but that 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.759
 is not where we see them is stays 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.280
 same thing only the ms gets higher up 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.990
 special poepertjes or special score 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.820
 streams so it's handy to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.500
 but I would not recommend it 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.000
 to always use 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.920
 but today I want you here with them 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.420
 Go about which you are best at 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.729
 first of their locks on call or 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.320
 duty ghost and what weapons you just have 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.780
 not a lok as first also all 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.920
 duty ghost because if you had level help 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.229
 get his challenge you get 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.630
 natural squad forest with that squad post 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.149
 can you buy weapons can you buy turkish 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.770
 you can buy anything you want 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.289
 it is when you first start 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.840
 with playing very limited you can only 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.310
 use a few squad boys and is possible too 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.410
 only use a few like you 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.200
 45 that is me now 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.000
 I now just have 60 squad 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.500
 angry about what i'm just good 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.340
 made my decision immediately at my 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.260
 very first 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.700
 a buy a squat dots go there 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.110
 don't think i love that whatever 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.430
 what we hope we clean up scott 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.590
 thorson on oh shit i also no and tess 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.090
 buy music because that is annoying you want 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.860
 just right jeere cress there you want 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.450
 just get good scores right away and me 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.000
 wants to help you today with 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.890
 thus achieving a good class plus 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.840
 scoring growth because the two chilliest 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.930
 weapons can use a game 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.709
 the dog badger and the a12 in my or 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.569
 sight 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.760
 I therefore find UHM machines in call or duty 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.440
 ghost really very bad 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.360
 i like its playing in leaks i have with 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.310
 the vector played a few games 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.890
 because it is still pretty tasty 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.660
 hand but the rest of the weapons 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.060
 player that really tasty and that's because 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.160
 the one rivals or the esl drive us 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.709
 really have the advantage over the 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.540
 Search engines so I would like you anyway 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.610
 so start playing coast like 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.040
 first ordinary in you 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.290
 esl doubt a lock and then on the a12 on 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.209
 the a12 has a high fire and a high one 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.680
 and crashing making you just targeted 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.360
 keep shooting and another high 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.060
 thermal and as the school the ideal 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.129
 weapon and also the rommy badger 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.870
 also a very accurate weapon so you 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.549
 can shoot very well straight ahead 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.470
 without getting too much prickles and 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.329
 In addition, it is also a weapon of 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.680
 built-in sawyer is in it 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.660
 and so for example you want pastors 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.130
 go play and you want to be a little bit with the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.900
 enemy flag so what i walk on here 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.700
 abyss gameplay 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.410
 do you actually need a shiner 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.389
 otherwise she knows exactly where you are 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.099
 know everything exactly where you shoot and 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.139
 then you are just dead at once 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.910
 So the horny base there is a chill to one 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.010
 bit and suggests class to get along with 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.709
 of the great work of course at ted 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.019
 science is the bee etcetera and the a12 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.669
 just a weapon that can use with 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.079
 flack jacket that can use with 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.180
 bamboo oil that you can use with 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.489
 just any puppy that does not state is because 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.269
 I really don't recommend boring them 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.919
 to set up 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.780
 the best is just having external macs then 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.040
 you taste much ml capacity 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.959
 and in addition you might be able to make a red 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.120
 doortje set up if you want but that 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.560
 let me finish the underline 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.030
 blocks first if you start with 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.590
 play call of duty ghost 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.139
 You can see it too I'm in the new 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.570
 predator miss oh no they miss predator like that 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.950
 is a score streak being three 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.329
 missiles in one 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.830
 and missing all that goes further 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.710
 automatically down so actually 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.060
 the predator michel is just going to 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.409
 going downstairs as normal 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.390
 then we miss another three bullets 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:30.710
 can shoot 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.810
 whole series of Korssendijk to use 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.670
 and I also recommend that for you 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.380
 it a habit and lure because with 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.820
 special play right away when you start with 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.620
 the game is not really recommended 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.820
 because you don't know how it works yet 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.860
 because you do not yet know how to put the folder 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.150
 put each other together and then it is most convenient 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.100
 to simply grab esselte just the set 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.170
 compact you have you naturally find the 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.310
 Guard too is really a very cheape score 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.620
 to use seacole 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.000
 sometimes a tad annoying of course 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.710
 if you just have enemy skills and such 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.660
 dog you come after and you with out 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.670
 or ammo but he is just chill 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.190
 personally for yourself 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.380
 standing is just a set could the gardon 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.270
 and then again that breeder is realloc or 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.440
 whatever the witch may be called 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.760
 I do not yet know how everything is with the 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.200
 we chose a coach so that stays that way 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.420
 no i learn a bit now in it 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.560
 start a little on my head 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.290
 learn because of course there must be 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.790
 fast but good the game spot 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.050
 is almost here again I think 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.020
 personally all risks really whole 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.430
 nice play i am now level 42 as i am 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.710
 it's good I've been trying 12 hours 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.120
 plain time it is over and it is like this 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.710
 fat to play i do have a few 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.270
 cams live now 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.700
 I am also going to be in one for the first time 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.890
 game play because so far I have every 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.140
 I just have a bit of a solo 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.630
 played without a headset on just f you 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.620
 them for myself and now I'm going like that 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.200
 immediately for the first time in a jar 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.120
 play with sandy with jordi with wessel 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.070
 with many other people the city 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.450
 goes anyway then she turns twenty 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.750
 time fun though so I think it's a great 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.430
 game 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.930
 I find a cool game to play and the 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.730
 back you debit if you can see is there 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.230
 here also a bit of a shame 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.610
 of course that there is no gold for it 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.950
 added on the playstation 3 and xbox 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.900
 360 but years of shit happens 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.580
 so the nextgen thinks so the place is 4 and 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.290
 xbox one will be fine again 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.700
 incorporated a tap response 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.110
 mackeeper sit on people again 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.610

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.680

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.330

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.310
 perth the best is a lok et cetera et 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.930
 cetera 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.100
 please leave me your thumb 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.630
 up behind and don't forget mine either 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.460
 other call or duty ghosts 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.530
 check movies on my channel sister 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.210
 can see my score is 40 to eleven as 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.770
 a nice jar to look at 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.210
 so I think they look promised 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.470
 fear not to like and until the next 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.470
 again bye bye
