00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
 look for a tenant who works incessantly in other years 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.960
 In the process, there will be a lot of clear water, care and pollutants 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.969
 cleaned 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.419
 When did you make the right choice with the JBL Coast Professional? 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.340
 how do you not look at the oldest professional 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.150
 make your aquaria bigger 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.489
 four models are available 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.350
 on the packaging page you will find a table 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.030
 which shows the right filter for your aquarium 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.110
 For example, the JBL Christel Profitgier 100 is for aquariums from 80 to 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.840
 150 liters of rowers they want to orient themselves along the length of the basin 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.060
 designed from 80 to 100 centimeters 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.400
 at first glance 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.400
 Some advantages are the oldest 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.710
 the free in Staufen 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.620
 strong magnet mounts from the outside 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.450
 keep the offender safe in his place 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.060
 so annoying suction cups with limited life become superfluous 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.020
 another advantage of the magnets 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.659
 there is no dispute between offender and aquarium sheath 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.590
 in which dirt can pay 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.050
 be trapped under Fischer 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.869
 have arrived at the top 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.660
 you can visit the Wasserburg 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.160
 set individually 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.900
 the pump performance was just frustrated 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.050
 the direction the water can be set from mere 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.500
 the most important advantages are in Rastatt 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.250
 Should they ever need a special percent reached therefore 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.080
 you can get a whole program of different filter media from JBL 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.430
 disposal 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.659
 so they can later media 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.619
 for a specific problem solving such as activated carbon team whole 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.720
 easy to use 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.590
 the activated carbon cartridge Barts instead of the sponge in one of the filter modules 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.130
 used finished 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.880
 if you remove the filter for cleaning out of the water 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.520
 prevent crosswise turn 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.520
 the dirty water gets back into your aquarium 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.840
 what has its seat 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.379
 can only pass through the filter media 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.230
 Michels a valve back to Enders Aquarium managed to wait 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.069
 just a few seconds off 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.079
 until no more water flows from the target then the filters can 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.309
 Sponges are easily cleaned or renewed 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:33.409
 some splash JBL dads start activating the culprit material with 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.149
 living bacteria for pollutant degradation as the for the 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:38.249
 restart 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:42.019
 After cleaning, the culprit simply returns to his position 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:42.769
 brought 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.310
 Peter Einigung has never been faster, easier and more comfortable 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.229
 Now we show them once again how the water purification in a year 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.479
 oldest professional in the team of Zenit St 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:03:01.019
 their aquariums water is announced through slits on the outside of the offender 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.309
 slit behind the dance is big the number of cases backing 6er wall 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.169
 happen 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.339
 and got into the large-sized fathers' cartridges in those 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.829
 the dirt is captured and broken down by bacteria 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.939
 through the central riser 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.780
 the water is sucked in by the pump 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.780
 and back to the aquariums 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.680
 at the water return 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.999
 you can choose from the abundant accessories 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.429
 they prefer only oxygen content l 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.489
 then that beam would be the right choice 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:43.069
 Do you want a quiet water surface so that no co2 is expelled 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.710
 becomes 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.300
 which plants need to grow 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.419
 would that already be suitable jet pipe 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.919
 Not even a diffuser will suit any of the oldest professionals 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.919
 the air automatically with at St 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:01.989
 it will grow from her JBL Christel Profi was nothing 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.400
 there is no a bigger aquarium 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.920
 or the fish stocking is increased 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.319
 and Danis made more demands on their filters 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.129
 You can use them by simply inserting one or more culprit modules 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:18.959
 enlarge the filter 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.329
 as already shown 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.219
 they have a whole concept 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:25.389
 Filter media available 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.300
 it should come to unwanted algae growth 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.449
 it works without old means 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.289
 then they simply draw the nutrients Bosshard as well as nitrate 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.880
 with me as the eleven of Sepp Holzer 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.880
 bothering us the Albi Jun kicked Ax 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.439
 for natural tropical water is available to all active Zoff granules 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.820

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.330
 the tracks and what's fun 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.860
 You can safely remove the list of medicines from ElCom Bohème Aykroyd 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.029
 Ska activated carbon 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:07.159
 there they should be through other inhabitants or offspring 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.130
 they demand higher levels of biodegradation power from their Sylter site 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.749
 I have the El Negro Mac Mini 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.000
 The high performance leds has Google Inc 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:33.139
 the women and inconspicuous color after the infield captured invisibly 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:34.740
 practically 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.120
 Magnet mounts hold the level in the filter 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.760
 without annoying suckers is safe and without gaps for divorce am 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.520

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.460
 unclean 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.030
 When cleaning, the dirty water can be filtered out of the filter or cleaned back into it 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.039
 Drain the aquarium 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:53.180
 comfortable 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.560
 Engine power and water flowed
