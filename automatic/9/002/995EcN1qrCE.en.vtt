00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.020
 map this traffic 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:59.930
 today so that's the green pass 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:03.050
 of 4 4 2 vs 2 large so is my 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.979
 place it like that while an arrow and 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:11.899
 you the guy the enemy in phase so there 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:15.229
 the steps ended up adding stuff I 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:17.899
 think we're going to break here and we're going 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.240
 to add other sites to be done seems 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.700
 took it like that so it's a little more 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.530
 big because that's a small 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.600
 finally it's small but it's galley 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:34.840
 business levy brouhaha or so that's it 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.520

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.439
