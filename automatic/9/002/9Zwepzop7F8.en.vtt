00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.240
 the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.480
 the sports fields 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.480
 behind the pool 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900
 I can put my heart in a fund on the street 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.910
 west pants 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.540
 with our house rules in the back 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.540
 at the corner 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.560
 and that failed 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.070
 then we immediately enter the living room 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.030
 the eta 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.410
 tvm corner 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.689
 wouter wall 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.139
 have the Netherlands 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.309
 so actually display error after another guest room 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.039
 thereby the day however 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.779
 because downstairs and 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.139
 that's actually a shower 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.449
 but there were also April joke 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.449
 so I solved it 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.169
 but to the kitchen 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.969
 which is very large 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.969
 just doesn't have that many tickets 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.929
 time money 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.179
 Such is also a big one 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.179
 cactus lessons 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.799
 the ek the sun comes too bad 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.799
 and a few the eurzone in the garden per belgian 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.609
 poppy itself also goes around the clock 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.799
 further village as a place and there it actually is also think 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:44.849
 after more than an hour 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.849
 blame the back of the house 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:04.279
 and then catch it 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.669
 and then go 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.669
 above 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.169
 rather three rooms 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.520
 the first and here is the guest room 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.740
 this has the first prize 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.860
 to know the larger the guest room 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.059
 who hardly uses 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:05.059
 the rich richer as a string room 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.939
 do sean march view from the balcony 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.939
 the streets in hours 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:22.309
 beautiful royal balcony 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.189
 with a view over the rest of the compound 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.629
 with 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.759

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:53.809
 like ours 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.809

 a large closet our own bed 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.699
 reflective crossing 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.589
 now is the nicest gift 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.219
 well not being able to sleep off the coast 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.219
 degradant 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.550
 I am a little Camorra 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.550

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.409
