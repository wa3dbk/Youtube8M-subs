00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.570
 jones 4 the application that allows you to 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.360
 transfer the content of your idevice 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.289
 to your computer 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.550
 hello so ipod touch and zappos is 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.680
 today I will remount the application 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.060
 slade sb for your idevice 5.0 plus 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.189
 What is slade sb 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.449
 who thanks to the studio and what is 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.910
 allows you to do so simply 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.009
 to have a little edge like this for 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.269
 change the brightness of your book and 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.920
 this directly from your springboard 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.020
 does everything in front of you 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.310
 he installed it confirmed once that is 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.630
 installed there will be no said designed 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.920
 springboard of your device there is a 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.840
 section in the settings that comes out 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.329
 plainly nothing to faure the web it is 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.360
 is foolish to pilot support and everything 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.980
 what did the application is a 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.629
 brightness change directly on 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.039
 springboard of course if you have 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.260
 business like dashboard and that that 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.579
 go a little bit embedded above 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.620
 as you can see if I can not 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.989
 do a lot because my budget 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.670
 of dashboard ex embarks from above by 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.980
 against if you have a secret a box 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.480
 full go board haunts the second 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.180
 row diddy combs and the third 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.410
 row makes it go down 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.030
 correctly unfortunately has them 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.650
 every page does that you can 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.390
 not configured optional only the 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.310
 third page for example I will find 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.930
 a good when a mother half by little 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.780
 next you go to the other who is too full 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.720
 finally that if you touch it comes back in 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.220
 phase i should change the brightness that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.380
 should change also in others 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.659
 pages otherwise it's all for 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.700
 the app stadium sb poor lady 5.0 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.079
 more so for the application this and 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.979
 a doe in total Save Review 2 of 5 stars 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.930
 but no it's something we'll put 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.070
 a star 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.399
 so why a star because ben 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.020
 there you know the very interesting cpo 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.640
 already that there are movement activity 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.439
 who can mess up the brightness 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.180
 it is rare that we change our immunity 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.860
 otherwise you just have to go in 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.030
 settings and the next section you 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.159
 that's the brightness 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.750
 otherwise if you have a telescope you 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.920
 can exchange in brightness and it was 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.329
 enough for this game the mines a star 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.200
 you public field how many canvases 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.490
 you'll just put in 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.290
 comments below on youtube 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.259
 only and that's all why it s b
