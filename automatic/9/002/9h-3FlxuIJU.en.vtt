00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.839
 so hello welcome to the 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.309
 sets of me by mike a cook 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.929
 So no gentleman block is an office 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.460
 and that really is part of it today 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.250
 So you always have to prepare yourself 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.850
 in this case, it's just a new one 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.800
 twist 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.170
 I have to briefly went purely we read 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 have a few excerpts 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.730
 prepared because he explains himself 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.529
 actually by itself 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.529
 I keep on watching a lot of fun 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:41.390
 Just cut the radical of the medium 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:45.040
 by or sharpener super a polonaise 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.040
 in super one can make something out of everything 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.980
 We can now even 15 minutes in there 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:01:00.440
 serve faster and easier 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:04.000
 to the skull ma you are definitely 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.000
 definitely checked here 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:17.840
 Welcome to love lt1 too much 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:21.460
 next cook round is on saturday and 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.460
 to distinguish roughly 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:32.610
 You can hear nicely in the micro nico 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.260
 crisp and now do not believe that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.030
 is useless because the romantic smells 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.030
 that already arise there so do you 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.510
 that's ready to cook 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.190
 I like that so probably tv cook 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.540
 You will not just have one like that 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.160
 someday I learned that cook 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.690
 also so and that's why excited 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.070
 So before I get to the point 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.450
 I'm in big 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.580
 houses ten years abroad 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.770
 Traveled back and forth as a chef 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.540
 Of course it is some positions today 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.030
 so I usually do that anyway 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.800
 culinary festivals or something like that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.410
 There are actually nice for that 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.390
 cool pictures was white you know 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.470
 Mike again so tick and I would say 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.470
 have fun watching it 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.090
 faster faster faster faster 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.810
 now we have to get faster 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.880
 work faster ok guys third there 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.080
 it says that please thank you but it is 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.080
 military tuned 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.630
 zig zag more cucumbers centered again 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.630
 work centered yes no maybe 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.650
 not only with me now 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.000
 professional kitchen and skilled chefs and 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.460
 colleagues through the area so shoos 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.200
 you too are in demand so who is with me 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.260
 he wants kitchens in the form of 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.460
 cook courses for example and there 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.660
 So you get tips and tricks 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.310
 first hand and just got me 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.080
 really to touch and I have the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.640
 people just as well in front of me and 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.500
 that's just a thing for me 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.300
 is a lot of fun and then it is 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.800
 it of course the show stage it can up 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.620
 Measures take place anyway 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.240
 Everything on the show stage is a fine one 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.680
 I see it as a rock 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.920
 band live is life is just that 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.920
 geilste 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.350
 Now I broke the glass 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:14.980
 Deglaze and cook only good things 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.670
 Take everything you drink market 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.570

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.570
 OK 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.849
 out 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.780
 get ready for the places and what should 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.920
 I say 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.920
 TOI Toi Toi 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.250
 and what's up to power around here with the eggs 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.350
 that's one of those 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.020
 that was 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.530
 either that helps in the construction 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.350
 and with that it had to run for kilometers 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.350
 really hard people 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.230
 rahimi 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.230

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.050
 We have such great donations 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.630
 come together over three million euros 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.940
 that I can build 14 schools out of it 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:10.930
 and this is the first school I am 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:12.130
 now I was allowed to come along with it that way 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.340
 it was actually more of me now 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.150
 There is not to be seen except 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.770
 bonus material, of course, but the funny 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.419
 drangehÃ¤ngt because you can see that it 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.780

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:54.280
