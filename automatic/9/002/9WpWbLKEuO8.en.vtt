like the formula and you can't beat the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.520 
like the formula and you can't beat the
price<00:03:23.280> on<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.519> my<00:03:24.389> complaints<00:03:25.049> for<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.380> one

are<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.769> packaging<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.609> depends<00:03:26.940> on<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.120> guys

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299

obviously if you want to say money then

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.420 
obviously if you want to say money then
package<00:03:31.139> is<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:31.380> not<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.680> big<00:03:31.950> deal<00:03:32.010> as<00:03:32.400> long

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
package is really not a big deal as long

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.759 
package is really not a big deal as long
as<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.730> product<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.269> good<00:03:33.450> which<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:34.019> but<00:03:34.709> I

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
as the product is good which it is but I

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.039 
as the product is good which it is but I
don't<00:03:35.010> like<00:03:35.250> how<00:03:35.579> thicknesses<00:03:36.450> it's<00:03:36.690> hard<00:03:36.900> for

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
don't like how thicknesses it's hard for

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.900 
don't like how thicknesses it's hard for
me<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.260> travel<00:03:37.470> with<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.010> since<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.370> such<00:03:38.700> a

I<00:03:39.540> don't<00:03:40.290> want<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.560> say<00:03:40.709> cheap<00:03:40.980> plastic<00:03:41.519> but<00:03:41.760> it

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
I don't want to say cheap plastic but it

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.819 
I don't want to say cheap plastic but it
just<00:03:42.180> it'll<00:03:42.480> break<00:03:42.690> really<00:03:43.079> easily<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:43.680> you

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
just it'll break really easily so you

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.199 
just it'll break really easily so you
have<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.130> be<00:03:44.220> careful<00:03:44.519> traveling<00:03:44.940> with<00:03:45.060> this

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
have to be careful traveling with this

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.509 
have to be careful traveling with this
if<00:03:45.359> anything<00:03:45.750> gets<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:46.139> it<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.410> will<00:03:46.620> crush<00:03:47.220> and

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
if anything gets on it it will crush and

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.270 
if anything gets on it it will crush and
crack<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.569> plastic<00:03:49.049> there<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.530> has<00:03:50.069> the

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
yeah the reason I choose this one

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.200 
yeah the reason I choose this one
even<00:04:23.199> though<00:04:23.289> I<00:04:23.319> love<00:04:23.740> both<00:04:24.099> of<00:04:24.130> these<00:04:24.490> the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
even though I love both of these the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.029 
even though I love both of these the
formula<00:04:25.780> on<00:04:25.930> this<00:04:26.110> one<00:04:26.349> is<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.560> little<00:04:26.889> bit

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
formula on this one is a little bit

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.999 
formula on this one is a little bit
smoother<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:29.110> don't<00:04:29.229> usually<00:04:29.560> go<00:04:29.860> by

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
smoother and I don't usually go by

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.740 
smoother and I don't usually go by
packaging<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.610> time<00:04:30.910> but<00:04:31.180> I<00:04:31.210> do<00:04:31.330> think<00:04:31.569> it's

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
packaging a time but I do think it's

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.390 
packaging a time but I do think it's
important<00:04:32.169> when<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:32.800> have<00:04:32.979> something<00:04:33.250> that

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
important when you have something that

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.589 
important when you have something that
you're<00:04:33.550> going<00:04:33.699> to<00:04:33.729> wear<00:04:33.880> everyday<00:04:34.270> and

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
you're going to wear everyday and

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.240 
you're going to wear everyday and
especially<00:04:34.840> for<00:04:35.080> me<00:04:35.229> I<00:04:35.259> travel<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.800> lot<00:04:35.830> I<00:04:36.009> don't

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
especially for me I travel a lot I don't

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.620 
especially for me I travel a lot I don't
want<00:04:36.370> something<00:04:36.610> that's<00:04:36.789> really<00:04:36.880> thick<00:04:37.389> take

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
want something that's really thick take

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.600 
want something that's really thick take
up<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.840> lot<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.020> room<00:04:38.259> it's<00:04:38.530> going<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.740> break<00:04:39.009> so

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
up a lot of room it's going to break so

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.339 
up a lot of room it's going to break so
I<00:04:39.639> do<00:04:39.789> like<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.330> packaging<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:40.930> this<00:04:41.080> but<00:04:41.319> I

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
I do like the packaging in this but I

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.439 
I do like the packaging in this but I
also<00:04:41.590> feel<00:04:42.039> that<00:04:42.069> the<00:04:42.370> formula<00:04:42.849> of<00:04:43.030> this<00:04:43.210> I

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
also feel that the formula of this I

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.309 
also feel that the formula of this I
don't<00:04:43.599> know<00:04:43.660> if<00:04:43.720> you<00:04:43.780> guys<00:04:43.870> can<00:04:44.050> see<00:04:44.169> on<00:04:44.199> the

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
don't know if you guys can see on the

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.089 
don't know if you guys can see on the
back<00:04:44.410> of<00:04:44.590> my<00:04:44.680> hand

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
back of my hand

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.580 
back of my hand
do<00:04:45.639> you<00:04:45.699> see<00:04:45.880> how<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.060> Bekaa<00:04:46.360> one<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.930> sticks<00:04:47.440> a

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
do you see how the Bekaa one it sticks a

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.379 
do you see how the Bekaa one it sticks a
little<00:04:47.800> bit<00:04:47.949> better<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:48.759> it's<00:04:48.910> going<00:04:49.030> to<00:04:49.090> last

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
little bit better so it's going to last

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.969 
little bit better so it's going to last
longer<00:04:49.599> throughout<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.349> day<00:04:50.530> it's<00:04:50.770> going<00:04:50.889> to

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
longer throughout the day it's going to
