00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.470
 beauty but do not worry anymore 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.559
 forward I will upload beauty videos but 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.389
 If you missed them or did not see them in the 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.599
 description of this video I'll leave you link 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.519
 so that parents and you see them and now better 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.470
 we see that you are looking for and not the 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.359
 you find so what happens happens this 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.800
 description and talking description of 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.810
 video and link of these videos so you 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.759
 I will leave the how to make the dough and how 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.760
 have it because because today we will talk 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.800
 over the salt mass if you go more 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.440
 later I uploaded those two videos 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.870
 so I thought I should go up the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.460
 video because maybe it's happened to you that I 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.460
 I said how to make them 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.699
 and put the refrigerator every time he 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.649
 just use the mind ballot or 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.989
 put it in an equal bag in a 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.460
 procedure in the refrigerator but if you 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.219
 you left outdoors and you're 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.979
 starting to dry actresses or not anymore no 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.299
 I can recover the one that's wrong, not anymore 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.759
 I can recover it 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.619
 then they can not be figurines anymore 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.479
 I do not know if it's starting to dry yet 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.640
 there is an option where you can 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.880
 recover if you want to know by serving this 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.880
 video 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.060
 what you will need is 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.310
 natural abue 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.920
 and obviously the dough that is drying 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.100
 what we are going to do is put your 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.090
 fingers to the water 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.159
 and start molding or kneading your dough 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.810
 until you run out completely 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.400
 the water and what to ensure to put up 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.430
 have the consistency that I had 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.869
 before it dries but remember 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:47.220
 this if you leave it outdoors because it 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.479
 It seems like it lasts like a rock, so 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.130
 there are still arrangements and if we have not 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.440
 dry as a procedure that I told you 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.119
 but remember do not overdo water 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.979
 because the only thing that will happen is that it 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.600
 going to save the dough then the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.850
 consistency that it must have is that it 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.190
 you should be stuck but that should be 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.410
 watery 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.470
 and it must have been inhabited or dry 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.810
 It must be fine at a perfect point 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.030
 as I said in the video 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.900
 so if you do not know how to do it 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.390
 visit this video and how it was worth it 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.959
 It was destroyed very short and we finished 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.670
