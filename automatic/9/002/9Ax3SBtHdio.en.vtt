pinecone because it's real sharp on the
edges<00:01:19.550> so<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:19.880> can<00:01:20.030> use<00:01:20.149> an<00:01:20.300> emery<00:01:20.479> board<00:01:20.630> mom

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
edges so you can use an emery board mom

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.810 
edges so you can use an emery board mom
might<00:01:21.680> have<00:01:21.710> one<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.160> those<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.580> could

might have one of those that you could
borrow<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:23.420> just<00:01:24.520> sand<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.670> edges<00:01:25.850> down<00:01:26.119> a

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
borrow and just sand the edges down a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.550 
borrow and just sand the edges down a
little<00:01:26.330> bit<00:01:26.569> so<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:26.990> doesn't<00:01:27.259> told<00:01:27.410> you

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
little bit so that it doesn't told you

cotton balls we're gonna pull them apart
into<00:01:39.380> little<00:01:39.500> pieces<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:40.160> we're<00:01:40.670> just<00:01:40.819> going

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
into little pieces and we're just going

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.609

all the way around your your vowel stick

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.510 
all the way around your your vowel stick
it<00:01:49.640> in<00:01:49.759> there<00:01:49.880> pretty<00:01:50.030> good<00:01:50.289> so<00:01:51.289> they<00:01:51.440> stay

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.380 

most<00:01:58.150> fouls<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.600> we<00:01:58.780> see<00:01:59.020> might<00:01:59.229> not<00:01:59.380> be<00:01:59.560> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
most fouls that we see might not be a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.630 
most fouls that we see might not be a
white<00:02:01.390> owl<00:02:01.570> there<00:02:02.380> are<00:02:02.530> snowy<00:02:02.860> owls<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.369> kind

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
white owl there are snowy owls that kind

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.120 
white owl there are snowy owls that kind
of<00:02:03.760> reminds<00:02:04.030> me<00:02:04.150> of<00:02:04.240> snowy<00:02:04.600> owl<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.920> in<00:02:06.040> the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
of reminds me of snowy owl but in the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:20.570 
of reminds me of snowy owl but in the
end<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.430> all<00:02:06.550> looks<00:02:06.760> like<00:02:06.850> an<00:02:07.060> owl

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.280 

so<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.180> get<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> idea<00:02:21.450> he's<00:02:21.900> starting<00:02:22.260> to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
so you get the idea he's starting to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.860 
so you get the idea he's starting to
look<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.830> starting<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.250> look<00:02:23.340> like<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.520> body

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
look it's starting to look like a body

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.200 
look it's starting to look like a body
so<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:24.990> can<00:02:25.020> take<00:02:25.290> some<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.910> scales

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
so we can take some of this the scales

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.580 
so we can take some of this the scales
that<00:02:27.390> we<00:02:27.510> took<00:02:27.630> off<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.810> bottom<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.440> can

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
that we took off the bottom and we can

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
that we took off the bottom and we can
glue<00:02:28.710> them<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.070> top

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
glue them to the top

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.760 
glue them to the top
