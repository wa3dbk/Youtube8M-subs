00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.360
 they are two central a sordid in right 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.960
 with height 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.090
 and that's what we have and we adapt 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.890
 what we have these guys 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.900
 as we have departed you have 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.050
 every week those who do not play 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.810
 they play the official match the next 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.030
 of training I want to say they have 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.280
 always participated with us in those 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.300
 matches yes we have seen it as 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.760
 all the guys that come with us 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.290
 we 've seen it during those games the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.210
 objective of those parties that 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.520
 we know them apart from the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.570
 games that play in their category and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.600
 good are the two central 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.200
 we need because it offers us so 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.030
 it could be is not we have to have 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.190
 clear central I think what he 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.540
 tried to tell the players inside 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.820
 the protest that if they are done they have 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.290
 educated because we already have enough trouble 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.420
 with the expulsions with the penalties that 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.549
 do not whistle and if on top of you talking 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.140
 nor will it be to change the referee what 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.920
 that can make you see the error 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.210
 but good also happens to you that they are things 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.060
 unfair as it happened I had it with the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.440
 fourth referee because he whistles that and tells me 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.830
 ma we're doing very well 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.869
 and you very bad then a little 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.700
 superb or cocky I lack lack of 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.890
 respect what I say what I ask 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.020
 start for the two same once you 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.460
 you do it right or wrong or I do it 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.350
 right or wrong is that he is peter for it 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.340
 The same is how the other new day 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.350
 criteria for the same and they say good 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.330
 against that which is arbitrary does not tell 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.300
 to any coach or from Madrid 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.300
 barcelona then those changes of 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.280
 inequality and injustice criterion or 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.539
 of lack of equality than what we ask 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.580
 I do not want them to give me anything 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.410
 but I say another topic just like the other 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.090
 because you treat me differently so 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.289
 from there you can not enter us anymore 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.170
 but that he found out a little bit ago 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.789
 I feel some trained pretty well today 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.649
 I wink the little pain like that when the 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.000
 first door that is normal so 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.530
 well first we have to wait for 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.060
 be one hundred percent to know that the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.470
 workouts are at maximum 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.570
 requirement 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.580
 from there we will see it in 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.430
 the trainings after so long 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.250
 stopped the player needs to train and 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.410
 recover pace because I will not compete is 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.660
 hard to come back so we're going to see it 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.390
 week to week we the truth that 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.520
 we are very focused and involved in 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.380
 tomorrow's game that as I always said 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.930
 it's another final and we play what this 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.080
 we know good have also received goals 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.170
 and all the parties are different in 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.640
 different story evidently if it happens 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.060
 that will be a penalty 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.700
 and we more or less know who 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.410
 they are the shooters and as I always say 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.050
 for me the player who pulls that has 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.930
 trust me I do not like to impose no 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.069
 because I have played football and I prefer 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.630
 throw if I have confidence not that I 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.520
 force in my case always threw 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.000
 but there are players out there who prefer 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.590
 do not throw away then I respect that a lot and 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.540
 I like that the game has confidence 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.500
 so we have to play like 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.630
 we are playing 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.670
 and with that safe level we 're going to 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.160
 look for the formula to be able to beat well 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.780
 not only that he is a great goalkeeper, 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.690
 that team that is so solid 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.910
 defensively it's not pure caution 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.530
 because he had a family problem 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.990
 important then travel tomorrow morning 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.870
 but good I have to take 19 in 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.270
 actually I have 19 players in the case 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.280
 that does not come something that 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.620
 we know that it will not be like this but never 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.270
 you know when you have a problem 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.900
 family and the truth that we 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.180
 as well 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.920
 two months ago we're at a party 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.380
 decisive and decisive week what each 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.040
 once we have more margin by not winning but 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.540
 I as I told the beginning by so many 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.370
 years I like to watch football match 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.500
 party for me the lift now is 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.050
 fundamental, we can not do more 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.850
 calculations if we do not win the next 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.410
 think of later serving us so 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.540
 we are sitting tomorrow that 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.600
 as I said when I've always borrowed 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.100
 that previously the same I came here 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.470
 with a very precise goal of being 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.740
 these months here next to a being 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.470
 wanted to give life to try 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.750
 help him get ahead and as I said to 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.070
 my personal interest never existed 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.200
 If I had not come if I had 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.450
 thought of my interest or my image not 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.610
 came the stable situation so it's 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.170
 very clear that I showed it by renouncing 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.210
 to which he resigned in qatar and in coming 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.249
 without condition none of groups to 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.659
 who wanted and I accepted it for these months 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:37.269
 I do not care anything for me what I 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:38.829
 The Levante and the parties that 

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:40.509
 we have that for me the most important thing 

00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:43.589
 then the others I do not have any 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.589
 special interest in nothing
