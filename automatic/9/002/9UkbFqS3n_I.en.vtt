for this show I don't think it would
work<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.579> every<00:01:59.939> single<00:02:00.180> type<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.659> show<00:02:00.840> but

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
work for every single type of show but

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.780 
work for every single type of show but
for<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.619> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.890> work<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.250> weird<00:02:02.520> way

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
for this be kind of work in a weird way

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.969 
for this be kind of work in a weird way
to<00:02:02.820> me<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.240> felt<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.689> girlish<00:02:04.170> South<00:02:04.560> Park

to me it felt like a girlish South Park
which<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.310> funny<00:02:05.579> because<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> Powerpuff

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
which is funny because the Powerpuff

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.819 
which is funny because the Powerpuff
Girls<00:02:06.270> themselves<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.020> made<00:02:07.049> references<00:02:07.770> to

South Park in the original cartoon it
kind<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.660> reminded<00:02:09.929> me<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
kind of reminded me of the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.980 
kind of reminded me of the
like<00:02:10.670> Cartoon<00:02:11.060> Network<00:02:11.330> specials<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:11.900> they

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
like Cartoon Network specials that they

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.360 
like Cartoon Network specials that they

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.800 
would do in between the episodes like
those<00:02:13.520> little<00:02:13.730> shorts<00:02:14.300> where<00:02:14.600> they<00:02:14.690> would

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
those little shorts where they would

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.030 
those little shorts where they would
take<00:02:14.840> old<00:02:15.170> cartoons<00:02:15.590> they<00:02:15.710> put<00:02:15.830> them<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:15.950> a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.580 
with Mojo Jojo and he's talking about
some<00:03:08.210> Blue<00:03:08.540> Fairy<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:09.080> visited<00:03:09.350> him<00:03:09.470> or

some Blue Fairy that visited him or

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.060 
some Blue Fairy that visited him or
something<00:03:09.770> like<00:03:09.830> that

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
something like that

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.010 
something like that
and<00:03:10.220> by<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.520> time<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.850> was<00:03:10.910> over<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.360> had<00:03:11.690> no

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
and by the time it was over I had no

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.750 
and by the time it was over I had no
clue<00:03:12.290> what<00:03:12.560> they<00:03:12.650> were<00:03:12.680> talking<00:03:13.070> about<00:03:13.280> but<00:03:13.700> it

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
clue what they were talking about but it

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.830 
clue what they were talking about but it
was<00:03:13.790> too<00:03:13.970> late<00:03:14.120> was<00:03:14.300> time<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.480> move<00:03:14.570> on<00:03:14.660> the

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
was too late was time to move on the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.480 
was too late was time to move on the
next<00:03:14.900> thing<00:03:15.080> so<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.440> loved<00:03:15.710> that<00:03:15.740> frantic<00:03:16.160> pace

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
next thing so I loved that frantic pace

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.770 
next thing so I loved that frantic pace
because<00:03:16.820> they<00:03:16.880> did<00:03:17.060> have<00:03:17.330> that<00:03:17.540> in<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
because they did have that in the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.880 
because they did have that in the
original<00:03:18.080> series<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.500> wish<00:03:18.650> there<00:03:18.800> was

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
original series but I wish there was

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.320 
original series but I wish there was
those<00:03:19.040> moments<00:03:19.250> that<00:03:19.430> they<00:03:19.610> had<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:20.030> slowdown

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
those moments that they had the slowdown

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.420 
those moments that they had the slowdown
paced<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.930> original<00:03:21.200> series<00:03:21.350> had<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.160> I

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
paced the original series had to and I

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.460 
paced the original series had to and I
gotta<00:03:22.640> be<00:03:22.730> honest<00:03:23.210> an<00:03:23.360> episode<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:23.930> revolves

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
gotta be honest an episode that revolves

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.900 
gotta be honest an episode that revolves
around<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.800> video<00:03:25.040> game<00:03:25.340> that's<00:03:25.580> based<00:03:25.760> on

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
around a video game that's based on

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.210 
around a video game that's based on
Dance<00:03:26.270> Dance<00:03:26.660> Revolution<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:27.560> was<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.800> few

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
Dance Dance Revolution it was a few

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.220 
Dance Dance Revolution it was a few
years<00:03:28.610> too<00:03:29.030> late<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.690> feel<00:03:29.870> like<00:03:29.960> this<00:03:30.020> maybe

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
years too late I feel like this maybe

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.620 
years too late I feel like this maybe
was<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.500> script<00:03:30.800> that<00:03:30.860> was<00:03:31.280> tossed<00:03:32.030> aside<00:03:32.210> and

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
was a script that was tossed aside and

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.730 
was a script that was tossed aside and
never<00:03:32.810> made<00:03:33.050> and<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.290> was<00:03:33.380> like<00:03:33.470> well<00:03:33.590> let's

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
never made and it was like well let's

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.320 
never made and it was like well let's
just<00:03:33.830> use<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.280> one<00:03:34.520> script<00:03:34.820> we<00:03:34.910> have<00:03:35.060> left

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
just use this one script we have left

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.880 
just use this one script we have left
from<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.600> old<00:03:35.780> series<00:03:36.080> this<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.710> not

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
from the old series this is not

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.320 
from the old series this is not
contradicting<00:03:37.610> on<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.820> animation<00:03:38.090> style

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
contradicting on the animation style

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.940 
contradicting on the animation style
because<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:38.660> did<00:03:38.840> like<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.290> animation<00:03:39.770> style

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
because it did like the animation style

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.800 
because it did like the animation style
but<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.280> will<00:03:40.460> say<00:03:40.640> this<00:03:40.820> animation<00:03:41.180> style<00:03:41.540> felt

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
but I will say this animation style felt

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.590 
but I will say this animation style felt
a<00:03:41.870> little<00:03:42.020> bit<00:03:42.230> more<00:03:42.500> girly<00:03:43.490> to<00:03:43.790> me<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.390> fun

called<00:04:28.310> Fibonacci<00:04:28.879> sequence<00:04:29.270> who's<00:04:29.629> a<00:04:29.750> math

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
called Fibonacci sequence who's a math

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.170

based<00:04:30.530> singer<00:04:31.159> and<00:04:31.400> so<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.580> lot<00:04:31.879> of<00:04:31.909> his

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180

references<00:04:33.050> are<00:04:33.199> math<00:04:33.800> based<00:04:34.189> so<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.430> was

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
references are math based so that was

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:35.649
