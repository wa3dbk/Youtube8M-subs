basically nothing done to it and you see

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.910 
basically nothing done to it and you see
it<00:01:09.920> still<00:01:10.100> has<00:01:10.400> quite<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.180> factory<00:01:11.840> shine

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920

whereas with you know about a you know
less<00:01:17.030> than<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.240> minute<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:17.720> airbrushing<00:01:19.030> you

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
less than a minute of airbrushing you

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.270 
less than a minute of airbrushing you

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
and give it a little bit of just a base

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.490 
and give it a little bit of just a base
level<00:01:26.060> of<00:01:26.780> dirt<00:01:27.260> and<00:01:28.330> it<00:01:29.330> really<00:01:29.690> looks<00:01:29.900> much

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
level of dirt and it really looks much

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.470 
level of dirt and it really looks much
more<00:01:30.790> realistic<00:01:33.160> so<00:01:34.160> with<00:01:34.910> that<00:01:35.030> being<00:01:35.180> said

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
now the fan exhausts at the bottom as

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.940 
now the fan exhausts at the bottom as
you<00:03:20.510> would<00:03:20.690> your<00:03:20.840> your<00:03:21.200> normal<00:03:21.500> range<00:03:21.710> hood

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
filters over top of the opening now if

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.740 
filters over top of the opening now if
you're<00:03:31.490> if<00:03:31.760> you're<00:03:31.910> close<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.180> an<00:03:32.420> exterior

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
you're if you're close to an exterior

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.890 
you're if you're close to an exterior
wall<00:03:33.580> obviously<00:03:34.580> be<00:03:35.030> easier<00:03:35.360> just<00:03:35.390> to<00:03:35.600> run<00:03:35.750> the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
wall obviously be easier just to run the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.080 
wall obviously be easier just to run the
vent<00:03:36.250> outside<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.400> wall<00:03:37.720> but<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:39.250> not<00:03:40.250> able<00:03:40.670> to

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
vent outside the wall but I not able to

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.630 
vent outside the wall but I not able to
do<00:03:41.360> that<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:41.990> I<00:03:42.230> just<00:03:42.770> run<00:03:42.950> a<00:03:43.010> couple<00:03:43.250> furnace

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
do that so I just run a couple furnace

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.400 
do that so I just run a couple furnace
filters<00:03:44.000> there<00:03:44.270> and<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.870> remove<00:03:45.140> all<00:03:45.290> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
filters there and to remove all the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.690 
filters there and to remove all the
particulates<00:03:46.210> from<00:03:47.210> the<00:03:47.390> paint<00:03:47.600> itself<00:03:47.930> and

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
particulates from the paint itself and

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.830 
particulates from the paint itself and
that<00:03:49.700> does<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:49.880> pretty<00:03:50.090> good<00:03:50.180> job<00:03:50.330> now<00:03:50.750> it

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
that does a pretty good job now it

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.640 
that does a pretty good job now it
doesn't<00:03:51.110> remove<00:03:51.350> all<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.740> smell<00:03:52.040> but<00:03:53.650> it's

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
doesn't remove all the smell but it's

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.190 
doesn't remove all the smell but it's
it's<00:03:55.280> effective<00:03:55.820> it's<00:03:56.660> effective<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.110> it

it's effective it's effective and it

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.920 
it's effective it's effective and it
does<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.500> job<00:03:57.530> it's<00:03:57.890> much<00:03:58.100> better<00:03:58.250> than<00:03:58.459> just

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
does the job it's much better than just

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.870

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.050 
remember I think there was something
else<00:05:11.810> in<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.260> in<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:13.010> kit<00:05:13.250> but<00:05:13.550> it<00:05:13.910> was<00:05:14.030> a

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
else in the in the kit but it was a

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.670 
else in the in the kit but it was a
great<00:05:14.270> deal<00:05:14.450> for<00:05:14.690> 90<00:05:14.990> bucks<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:15.470> it's<00:05:16.340> this

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
great deal for 90 bucks and it's this

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.080 
great deal for 90 bucks and it's this
Patriot<00:05:18.680> 105<00:05:19.310> it's<00:05:20.000> a<00:05:20.150> top<00:05:20.390> feed<00:05:21.730> airbrush<00:05:22.730> and

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
Patriot 105 it's a top feed airbrush and

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.900 
Patriot 105 it's a top feed airbrush and
so<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.050> paint<00:05:24.230> just<00:05:24.350> goes<00:05:24.560> in<00:05:24.770> there<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:25.520> you

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
so the paint just goes in there and you

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.710 
so the paint just goes in there and you
can<00:05:26.060> see<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.600> actual<00:05:27.250> see<00:05:28.250> them<00:05:28.460> on<00:05:29.150> here<00:05:29.570> but

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
can see the actual see them on here but

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.210 
can see the actual see them on here but
you<00:05:29.750> can<00:05:29.930> see<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:30.169> actual<00:05:30.260> needle<00:05:30.800> in<00:05:30.980> there

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
you can see the actual needle in there

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.620 
you can see the actual needle in there
at<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.330> bottom<00:05:32.660> of<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:33.020> cup<00:05:33.590> and<00:05:33.890> this<00:05:34.669> is<00:05:34.940> so

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
at the bottom of the cup and this is so

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.620 
at the bottom of the cup and this is so
much<00:05:35.870> easier<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:36.440> clean<00:05:37.510> basically<00:05:38.510> you<00:05:38.570> don't

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
much easier to clean basically you don't

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.360 
much easier to clean basically you don't
have<00:05:38.810> to<00:05:38.900> clean<00:05:39.110> out<00:05:39.230> the<00:05:39.380> needle<00:05:39.680> to<00:05:40.190> that

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
have to clean out the needle to that

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.700 
have to clean out the needle to that
point<00:05:40.730> and<00:05:40.990> even<00:05:41.990> if<00:05:42.169> you<00:05:42.260> want<00:05:42.410> to<00:05:42.470> clean<00:05:42.680> the

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
point and even if you want to clean the

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.969 
point and even if you want to clean the
needle<00:05:43.130> off<00:05:43.310> you<00:05:43.550> just<00:05:43.760> back<00:05:44.360> off<00:05:44.390> this<00:05:44.979> screw

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
needle off you just back off this screw

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.560 
needle off you just back off this screw
here<00:05:46.370> and<00:05:46.430> the<00:05:46.640> needle<00:05:46.910> comes<00:05:47.150> out<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:47.419> back

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
here and the needle comes out the back

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.490 
here and the needle comes out the back
end<00:05:47.900> and<00:05:48.140> you<00:05:48.680> can<00:05:48.860> wipe<00:05:49.070> that<00:05:49.100> off<00:05:49.340> and<00:05:50.500> much

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
end and you can wipe that off and much

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.310 
end and you can wipe that off and much
faster<00:05:51.800> to<00:05:52.370> clean<00:05:52.669> and<00:05:53.000> so<00:05:53.720> consequently<00:05:54.080> I

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
faster to clean and so consequently I

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.710 
faster to clean and so consequently I
find<00:05:54.740> myself<00:05:55.120> you<00:05:56.120> know<00:05:56.210> I<00:05:56.240> don't<00:05:56.540> mind

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
find myself you know I don't mind

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.150 
find myself you know I don't mind
