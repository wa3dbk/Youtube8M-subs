00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
their sigmax line which is all synthetic

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.319 
their sigmax line which is all synthetic
and<00:01:47.009> synthetic<00:01:47.520> brushes<00:01:47.729> are<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.210> good

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and synthetic brushes are really good

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.389 
and synthetic brushes are really good
with<00:01:48.450> foundations<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.290> creams<00:01:49.590> because

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
with foundations and creams because

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.639 
with foundations and creams because
synthetics<00:01:51.180> perform<00:01:51.630> best<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:52.140> creams<00:01:52.439> and

synthetics perform best with creams and

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.530 
synthetics perform best with creams and
liquids<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.310> really<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.700> entire<00:01:54.030> line<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
liquids so really this entire line is

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.999 
liquids so really this entire line is
great<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.930> foundation<00:01:55.500> when<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.799> one's

and almost contours my face with them a
little<00:03:03.140> bit<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:03.680> these<00:03:03.800> days<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.190> find<00:03:04.400> myself

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
little bit so these days I find myself

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.930 
little bit so these days I find myself
reaching<00:03:04.880> between<00:03:05.180> my<00:03:05.480> Mac<00:03:05.660> 129<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.650> my<00:03:07.400> Sigma

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
reaching between my Mac 129 and my Sigma

reaching between my Mac 129 and my Sigma
SS<00:03:08.480> 168<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.110> think<00:03:09.440> it's<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.830> f40<00:03:10.700> now<00:03:10.850> I'm

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
SS 168 I think it's the f40 now I'm

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.700 
SS 168 I think it's the f40 now I'm
pretty<00:03:11.570> sure<00:03:11.750> that's<00:03:11.960> the<00:03:12.050> number<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.560> is

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
pretty sure that's the number that it is

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.620 
pretty sure that's the number that it is
but<00:03:13.490> I<00:03:13.520> reached<00:03:13.850> between<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.210> two<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.480> those

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.360 
but I reached between the two of those
interchangeably<00:03:14.990> now<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.830> then<00:03:16.070> my<00:03:16.160> last

interchangeably now and then my last

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.170 
interchangeably now and then my last
favorite<00:03:16.730> face<00:03:17.090> brush<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.840> mac<00:03:18.050> 109<00:03:18.709> and

the perfect stiff brush for packing on

the perfect stiff brush for packing on
color<00:03:57.320> on<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.860> lid<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:58.640> like<00:03:58.880> that<00:03:59.030> it's

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
color on the lid and I like that it's

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.790 
color on the lid and I like that it's
just<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.510> perfect<00:03:59.690> size<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.350> not<00:04:00.440> too<00:04:00.680> big

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
just the perfect size it's not too big

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.860 
just the perfect size it's not too big
it's<00:04:00.860> not<00:04:01.070> too<00:04:01.160> small<00:04:01.310> it's<00:04:01.880> not<00:04:02.150> super<00:04:02.600> fluffy

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
it's not too small it's not super fluffy

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.440 
it's not too small it's not super fluffy
so<00:04:03.290> it's<00:04:03.440> not<00:04:03.590> you<00:04:04.160> know<00:04:04.190> putting<00:04:04.910> fall<00:04:05.269> out

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
so it's not you know putting fall out

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.180 
so it's not you know putting fall out
everywhere<00:04:05.840> as<00:04:05.989> you<00:04:06.140> use<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.410> then<00:04:06.830> my<00:04:07.010> other

shader brush and I got this in a set at

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.289 
shader brush and I got this in a set at
imats<00:04:15.769> it<00:04:16.340> was<00:04:16.459> part<00:04:16.700> of<00:04:16.730> a<00:04:16.820> limited<00:04:17.180> edition

imats it was part of a limited edition
set<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.230> so<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:18.560> don't<00:04:19.070> know<00:04:19.190> what<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.430> actual

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
set and so I don't know what the actual

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.969 
set and so I don't know what the actual
number<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.269> it<00:04:20.479> is<00:04:20.630> but<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.500> know<00:04:21.560> that<00:04:21.799> it's

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
number of it is but I know that it's

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.940

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
part of their silk proline and it's one

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.260

of their medium shader brush
shizz<00:04:26.449> and<00:04:26.479> this<00:04:26.810> is<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:26.990> lot<00:04:27.259> like<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.560> 239<00:04:28.129> in

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
shizz and this is a lot like the 239 in

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.070 
shizz and this is a lot like the 239 in
the<00:04:28.400> fact<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.699> it's<00:04:28.879> really<00:04:29.150> stiff<00:04:29.479> it<00:04:29.720> is

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
the fact that it's really stiff it is

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.550 
the fact that it's really stiff it is
quite<00:04:30.319> a<00:04:30.349> bit<00:04:30.530> bigger<00:04:30.830> um<00:04:32.169> but<00:04:33.169> it<00:04:33.319> is<00:04:33.470> very

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
quite a bit bigger um but it is very

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.430 
quite a bit bigger um but it is very
stiff<00:04:34.069> so<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.310> like<00:04:34.610> using<00:04:34.819> this<00:04:35.210> I<00:04:35.810> used<00:04:36.289> it

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
stiff so I like using this I used it

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.439 
stiff so I like using this I used it
today<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:36.710> pack<00:04:36.979> on<00:04:37.190> my<00:04:37.520> lid<00:04:37.879> color<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.389> it

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
today to pack on my lid color and it

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.480 
today to pack on my lid color and it
works<00:04:38.690> really<00:04:38.930> well<00:04:39.080> then<00:04:39.620> for<00:04:40.039> blending

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
this better than the Mac 224 because

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.040

is<00:05:30.080> much<00:05:30.319> more<00:05:30.500> tapered<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:31.099> then<00:05:31.370> my<00:05:31.490> other

the<00:05:43.250> e-40<00:05:43.759> from<00:05:43.969> Sigma<00:05:44.360> but<00:05:44.810> it's<00:05:44.930> nice<00:05:45.110> for

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 
the e-40 from Sigma but it's nice for

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.830 
the e-40 from Sigma but it's nice for
putting<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.830> more<00:05:46.460> concentrated<00:05:47.029> color<00:05:47.569> in

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
putting a more concentrated color in

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.420 
putting a more concentrated color in
your<00:05:47.870> crease<00:05:48.289> and<00:05:48.529> blending<00:05:48.860> it<00:05:48.979> out<00:05:49.099> so<00:05:49.370> if

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
brush this is my favorite pencil brush

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.890 
brush this is my favorite pencil brush
because<00:06:19.520> I<00:06:19.699> like<00:06:19.940> the<00:06:19.969> size<00:06:20.330> and<00:06:20.599> I<00:06:20.659> like<00:06:20.870> the

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
because I like the size and I like the

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.950 
because I like the size and I like the
length<00:06:21.289> um<00:06:21.919> it's<00:06:22.190> not<00:06:22.370> so<00:06:22.729> big<00:06:23.090> that<00:06:23.389> it's<00:06:23.750> not

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
length um it's not so big that it's not

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.379 
length um it's not so big that it's not
precise<00:06:24.500> and<00:06:24.949> I<00:06:25.340> liked<00:06:25.580> it<00:06:25.699> it's<00:06:25.819> a<00:06:25.909> little<00:06:26.270> bit

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
precise and I liked it it's a little bit

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.059 
precise and I liked it it's a little bit
longer<00:06:26.719> because<00:06:27.050> it<00:06:27.409> gives<00:06:27.590> you<00:06:27.830> a<00:06:27.860> little

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:28.069 
longer because it gives you a little

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:32.860 
longer because it gives you a little
more<00:06:29.380> flexibility<00:06:30.380> and<00:06:30.740> it's<00:06:30.889> not<00:06:31.099> so<00:06:31.840> try<00:06:32.840> to

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
more flexibility and it's not so try to

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.329 
more flexibility and it's not so try to
think<00:06:32.990> of<00:06:33.169> the<00:06:33.229> word<00:06:33.349> it<00:06:33.469> doesn't<00:06:33.740> apply<00:06:33.949> color

00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:34.339 
think of the word it doesn't apply color

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:37.540 
think of the word it doesn't apply color
as<00:06:35.229> intensely<00:06:36.229> is<00:06:36.469> something<00:06:36.860> that's<00:06:36.979> shorter

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
as intensely is something that's shorter

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.010 
as intensely is something that's shorter
it<00:06:37.759> gives<00:06:38.120> you<00:06:38.210> a<00:06:38.270> little<00:06:38.419> bit<00:06:38.599> more<00:06:38.750> of<00:06:38.839> like<00:06:38.990> a

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
it gives you a little bit more of like a

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.610

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
for gel liner but then I started using

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.550 
for gel liner but then I started using
this<00:07:01.010> because<00:07:01.699> i<00:07:01.729> think<00:07:01.850> my<00:07:02.600> all<00:07:03.080> of<00:07:03.139> my<00:07:03.320> mac

this because i think my all of my mac

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.469 
this because i think my all of my mac
ones<00:07:03.800> were<00:07:04.040> dirty<00:07:04.340> one<00:07:04.580> day<00:07:04.729> so<00:07:04.790> i<00:07:04.940> used<00:07:05.180> this

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 
ones were dirty one day so i used this

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.780 
ones were dirty one day so i used this
bride<00:07:05.810> gel<00:07:06.020> liner<00:07:06.199> and<00:07:06.470> i<00:07:06.979> really<00:07:07.370> liked<00:07:07.580> how

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:07.790

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
much control it gave me with applying my

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.670 
much control it gave me with applying my
gel<00:07:10.070> liner<00:07:10.310> because<00:07:10.580> it<00:07:11.030> allows<00:07:11.960> me<00:07:12.199> to<00:07:12.380> really

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
gel liner because it allows me to really

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.529 
gel liner because it allows me to really
control<00:07:13.250> where<00:07:13.729> I'm<00:07:13.850> putting<00:07:14.000> it<00:07:14.240> and<00:07:14.360> then<00:07:14.449> I

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
control where I'm putting it and then I

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.480 
control where I'm putting it and then I
also<00:07:14.750> with<00:07:15.050> the<00:07:15.139> angle<00:07:15.440> can<00:07:15.650> wing<00:07:16.010> it<00:07:16.039> really

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 
also with the angle can wing it really

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.210 
also with the angle can wing it really
