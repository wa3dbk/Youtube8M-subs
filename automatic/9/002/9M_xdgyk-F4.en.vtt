where we find a large with when you
think<00:04:04.950> when<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.400> think<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.879> woman<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.269> were

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
think when I think of a woman that were

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.570 
think when I think of a woman that were
a<00:04:06.390> weave<00:04:06.659> I<00:04:06.989> automatically<00:04:07.709> kind<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.250> tribute

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
a weave I automatically kind of tribute

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.390 
a weave I automatically kind of tribute
with<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:08.879> or<00:04:09.000> diva<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:11.040> might<00:04:11.250> not

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
with that or diva and it might not

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.250 
with that or diva and it might not
necessarily<00:04:11.580> be<00:04:11.970> true<00:04:12.090> but<00:04:12.569> because<00:04:12.930> that's

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
necessarily be true but because that's

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.890 
necessarily be true but because that's
what<00:04:13.470> we<00:04:13.590> see<00:04:13.830> by<00:04:14.459> large<00:04:14.849> within<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.360> majority

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
what we see by large within the majority

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.930 
what we see by large within the majority
that's<00:04:16.560> what<00:04:16.739> we<00:04:16.829> say<00:04:17.009> but<00:04:17.070> whereas<00:04:17.639> when<00:04:17.910> I

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
that's what we say but whereas when I

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.509 
that's what we say but whereas when I
think<00:04:18.180> of

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
think of

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.449 
think of
that<00:04:18.849> takes<00:04:19.780> time<00:04:20.019> out<00:04:20.079> to<00:04:20.620> take<00:04:21.160> care<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.400> my

self I said woman that is secure within
ourselves<00:04:25.300> and<00:04:26.039> that<00:04:27.039> might<00:04:27.250> not<00:04:27.280> necessarily

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
ourselves and that might not necessarily

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.670 
ourselves and that might not necessarily
be<00:04:27.909> true<00:04:28.030> either<00:04:28.419> look<00:04:28.990> at<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.199> story<00:04:29.470> with

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
know the natural hair and there were

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.249 
know the natural hair and there were
some<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.699> were<00:04:36.879> the<00:04:37.090> Wiis<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:38.110> know

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
some that were the Wiis and you know

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.300 
some that were the Wiis and you know
whether<00:04:38.470> or<00:04:38.620> not<00:04:38.680> if<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:38.919> was<00:04:38.979> straight<00:04:39.190> or

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
whether or not if it was straight or

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.939 
whether or not if it was straight or
whatever<00:04:39.580> but<00:04:40.210> even<00:04:40.720> within<00:04:40.990> that<00:04:41.139> movie<00:04:41.710> we

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
whatever but even within that movie we

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.740 
whatever but even within that movie we
got<00:04:42.159> a<00:04:42.220> chance<00:04:42.789> to<00:04:42.849> see<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.030> dichotomy<00:04:43.720> between

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
got a chance to see a dichotomy between

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.960 
got a chance to see a dichotomy between
the<00:04:44.440> two<00:04:44.590> there<00:04:45.069> were<00:04:45.190> some<00:04:45.400> girls<00:04:45.550> that<00:04:45.819> were

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
the two there were some girls that were

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.600 
the two there were some girls that were
actually<00:04:46.449> lost<00:04:46.720> within<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.979> natural

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
actually lost within the the natural

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.570 
actually lost within the the natural
look<00:04:49.180> like<00:04:49.509> it<00:04:49.690> actually<00:04:49.810> consumed<00:04:50.530> them<00:04:50.800> and

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
look like it actually consumed them and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.219 
look like it actually consumed them and
there<00:04:52.000> was<00:04:52.150> some<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.449> were<00:04:52.539> actually<00:04:52.930> lost

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
there was some that were actually lost

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.700 
there was some that were actually lost
in<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:54.190> falsified<00:04:54.970> look<00:04:55.810> as<00:04:56.020> well<00:04:56.319> so<00:04:56.680> I

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
in the the falsified look as well so I

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.890 
in the the falsified look as well so I
think<00:04:57.099> that<00:04:57.250> is<00:04:57.370> kind<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.699> like<00:04:57.759> a<00:04:57.909> you<00:04:58.750> know<00:04:58.810> a

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
think that is kind of like a you know a

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.719 
think that is kind of like a you know a
mixture<00:04:59.349> between<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.800> two<00:05:00.039> you<00:05:00.190> just<00:05:00.220> have<00:05:00.550> to

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
mixture between the two you just have to

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.999 
mixture between the two you just have to
know<00:05:01.630> who<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.110> are<00:05:02.289> know<00:05:02.560> what<00:05:02.590> you<00:05:02.830> like

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
know who you are know what you like

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.189 
know who you are know what you like
honestly<00:05:03.610> to<00:05:04.090> say<00:05:04.479> because<00:05:04.780> because<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.050> know<00:05:05.110> a

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
honestly to say because because I know a

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.320 
honestly to say because because I know a
lot<00:05:05.380> of<00:05:05.409> hairdressers<00:05:06.009> and<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.729> do<00:05:06.789> know<00:05:07.120> white

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
lot of hairdressers and I do know white

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.480 
lot of hairdressers and I do know white
women<00:05:07.360> who<00:05:07.720> get<00:05:07.900> weave<00:05:08.099> but<00:05:09.099> they<00:05:09.190> get<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.370> to

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
women who get weave but they get it to

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.040 
women who get weave but they get it to
make<00:05:09.639> their<00:05:09.789> own<00:05:09.849> hair<00:05:10.090> look<00:05:10.240> thicker<00:05:10.270> or<00:05:10.780> they

make their own hair look thicker or they

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.659 
make their own hair look thicker or they
get<00:05:11.199> it<00:05:11.349> because<00:05:11.620> they<00:05:11.860> don't<00:05:11.919> their<00:05:12.490> hair
