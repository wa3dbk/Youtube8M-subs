 I'll tell you how to update the iphone when 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.220
 make it right to nothing 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.220
 the worst did not happen to you 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.590
 before that you need one so big 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.540
 more precisely a little wisdom is 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.779
 backup needed 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.689
 at the same time how to create it before 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.790

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.160
 discard remove all unnecessary programs 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.010
 all than you do not pole maximize it 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.010
 you need to clean why because if 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.350
 suddenly the update wo n't go you will 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.030
 very long and tedious have 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.609
 restore troops what I am with this 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.760
 I personally encountered trying to update 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.710
 iphone happened some kind of mistake and in 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.070
 As a result , I had to restore from a copy 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.629
 very long and tedious so meth on the iPhone 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.879
 there was a whole bunch of few pictures 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.339
 gigabyte up so all over again 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.960
 cleared out cleared all thrown on 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.670
 computer project i have stati how 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.540
 skimming voice recordings for example and how 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.689
 delete in 1 click 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.409
 how to throw off notes again, delete them 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:17.020
 in 1 click iphone turn the video there you are 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:22.380
 all done click create a copy 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:25.390
 a copy is being made now it offers you 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.939
 backup your programs 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.430
 well why not make if you bought 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.799
 so it will be easier to install is 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.930
 backup started can you imagine 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.719
 make a check because it's a long time 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.270
 the main thing is not to turn off the computer while you 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.750
 something that does not turn off the iphone 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.240
 don't take it out and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.750
 little to no light blinked even if 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.740
 he does not oppress in principle as you have 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.960
 previous 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.330
 backup everything will be fine after that 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.880
 how did you back up yes to me 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.990
 it was created very long very much 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.200
 programs already 90 pieces on 10 gigov you 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.280
 live the magic button refresh and 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.480
 cross your toes ears 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:17.070
 so that the color does not blink click update and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.440

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.860
 carefully in quotes 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.120
 and wait waiting for the soul to be updated 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.150
 don't touch the main thing 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.550

 run anything on the computer 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.000
 dota phone goes video recording but 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.040
 it is desirable not to do such things 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.230
 art requires sacrifice 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.890
 wait don't be afraid if it starts 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.870
