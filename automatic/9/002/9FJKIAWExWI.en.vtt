00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
stories which I've always looked since I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.589 
stories which I've always looked since I
was<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> kid<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.669> because<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.269> television

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
was a kid but because of the television

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.420 
was a kid but because of the television
format<00:00:31.220> it's<00:00:32.220> lean<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.329> mean<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.710> fun<00:00:35.130> it's

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
format it's lean it's mean it's fun it's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.420 
format it's lean it's mean it's fun it's
epic<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.600> moves<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.770> got<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> real

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
epic but it moves and it's got a real

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.439 
epic but it moves and it's got a real
sense<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.879> pace<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.270> energy<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:41.329> think<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
sense of pace and energy I think it

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.380 
sense of pace and energy I think it
really<00:00:42.480> suits<00:00:43.199> this<00:00:43.559> story<00:00:44.449> beautifully
