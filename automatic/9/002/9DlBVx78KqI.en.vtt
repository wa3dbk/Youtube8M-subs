00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.140
 so as not to confuse the boxes 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.450
 the next step that needs to be done is 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.360

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.980

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.390
 and the mobile 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.800
 then we pressed the key 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.350

 to start the phrasing process 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.319
 it is important to have the samsung driver 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.590
