it's<00:00:09.990> getting<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> good<00:00:10.320> spark<00:00:10.679> but<00:00:10.980> it's<00:00:11.010> not

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
it's getting a good spark but it's not

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.350 
it's getting a good spark but it's not
not<00:00:12.870> getting<00:00:13.139> any<00:00:13.259> few<00:00:13.700> so<00:00:14.700> I'm<00:00:14.969> going<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> have

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
not getting any few so I'm going to have

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.560 
not getting any few so I'm going to have
to<00:00:15.480> struck<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.870> scarab<00:00:16.230> later<00:00:16.410> here<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.570> see

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
to struck the scarab later here and see

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.060 
to struck the scarab later here and see
what<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.960> photons<00:00:19.730> I'll<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:22.070> drink

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
what the photons I'll just drink

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:41.569 
what the photons I'll just drink
whatever<00:00:23.430> fuels<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.269> don't<00:00:24.510> hear<00:00:40.010> this<00:00:41.010> f3

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
whatever fuels I don't hear this f3

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
whatever fuels I don't hear this f3
there<00:00:42.230> that's<00:00:43.230> lack<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:45.260> fuel<00:00:46.260> weight<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
there that's lack the fuel weight of the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:57.760 
there that's lack the fuel weight of the
ball<00:00:49.969> seems<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:51.480> there<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.840> I'm<00:00:54.440> so

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:25.859 

amazed<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> pastry's<00:01:00.739> bottom<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> ball

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.570 

I<00:01:25.900> thought<00:01:26.530> maybe<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.979> flute<00:01:27.159> was<00:01:27.369> just

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
I thought maybe the flute was just

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.380 
I thought maybe the flute was just
sucking<00:01:27.820> on<00:01:28.030> it<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.390> I<00:01:29.640> tried<00:01:30.640> tap<00:01:30.940> no<00:01:31.150> say<00:01:31.330> to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
sucking on it and I tried tap no say to

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.149 
sucking on it and I tried tap no say to
the<00:01:31.570> Carib<00:01:31.840> leader<00:01:32.080> but<00:01:32.229> I've<00:01:32.710> doesn't<00:01:33.070> like

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
the Carib leader but I've doesn't like

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.240 
the Carib leader but I've doesn't like
any<00:01:33.340> deference<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:35.229> I<00:01:35.500> don't<00:01:35.830> know<00:01:35.950> what<00:01:36.130> I'm

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250
