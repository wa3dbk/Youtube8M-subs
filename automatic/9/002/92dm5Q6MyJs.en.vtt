appearance<00:00:42.170> which<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> pretty<00:00:44.340> damn<00:00:44.640> good

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700

appearance which is a pretty damn good
money<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.320> know<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.980> equaled<00:00:47.340> out

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
money you know I think that equaled out

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.069 
money you know I think that equaled out
to<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.300> over<00:00:49.200> two<00:00:49.379> million<00:00:49.680> dollars<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.250> year

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
to like over two million dollars a year

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.650 
to like over two million dollars a year
so<00:00:52.079> yeah<00:00:52.469> that's<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.250> pretty<00:00:53.789> damn<00:00:53.910> good<00:00:54.090> money

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
so yeah that's a pretty damn good money

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.170 
so yeah that's a pretty damn good money
but<00:00:55.010> CM<00:00:56.010> Punk<00:00:56.280> supposedly<00:00:56.910> decline<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.170> offer

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
but CM Punk supposedly decline the offer

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.230 
but CM Punk supposedly decline the offer
so<00:01:00.180> uh<00:01:01.879> if<00:01:02.879> TNA<00:01:03.480> did<00:01:03.930> pick<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.290> CM<00:01:04.830> Punk<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.430> think

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
so uh if TNA did pick up CM Punk I think

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.810 
so uh if TNA did pick up CM Punk I think
it'd<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.360> great<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.960> company<00:01:07.380> uh<00:01:07.820> would

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
it'd be great for the company uh would

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.080 
it'd be great for the company uh would
it<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.900> automatically<00:01:10.590> bring<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.640> huge

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
by rate maybe uh it didn't really happen

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.370

opinion I think Del Rio makes a hell of

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.970 
opinion I think Del Rio makes a hell of
a<00:02:20.920> heel<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:22.020> think<00:02:23.020> he<00:02:23.200> could<00:02:23.350> be<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.530> hell<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:23.830> a

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
a heel I think he could be a hell of a

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.660 
a heel I think he could be a hell of a
hill<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.490> TNA<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.800> like<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:26.920> said<00:02:26.980> Del<00:02:27.400> Rio<00:02:27.580> is
