00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.150 
ingredients but is it really the same
thing<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.459> is<00:04:10.610> it<00:04:10.760> as<00:04:10.910> reliable<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.560> how<00:04:12.980> they

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
thing and is it as reliable and how they

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.680 
thing and is it as reliable and how they
are<00:04:13.459> there<00:04:13.670> any<00:04:13.790> type<00:04:14.209> of<00:04:14.240> cheaper

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
are there any type of cheaper

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.610 
are there any type of cheaper
alternatives<00:04:15.290> or<00:04:15.350> should<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:15.590> say

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
alternatives or should I say

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.349 
alternatives or should I say
cost-effective<00:04:16.459> alternatives<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.210> this

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
cost-effective alternatives to this

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.750 
cost-effective alternatives to this
right<00:04:17.600> here<00:04:18.190> another<00:04:19.190> question<00:04:19.609> are<00:04:19.700> you

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
right here another question are you

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.840 
right here another question are you
going<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.000> be<00:04:20.090> reliable

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
going to be reliable

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.550 
going to be reliable
rechargeable<00:04:21.450> batteries<00:04:21.870> or<00:04:22.200> you're<00:04:22.470> going

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
rechargeable batteries or you're going

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.580 
rechargeable batteries or you're going
to<00:04:22.650> rely<00:04:23.250> more<00:04:23.550> on<00:04:23.610> alkaline<00:04:24.590> more

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
to rely more on alkaline more

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.770 
to rely more on alkaline more
traditional<00:04:26.010> batteries<00:04:26.370> ask<00:04:27.240> this<00:04:27.420> question

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
traditional batteries ask this question

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.270 
traditional batteries ask this question
because<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.350> know<00:04:28.470> without<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.830> batteries

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
because you know without the batteries

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.200 
because you know without the batteries
there's<00:04:29.460> no<00:04:29.550> point<00:04:29.760> in<00:04:29.790> having<00:04:29.910> all<00:04:30.120> these

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
there's no point in having all these

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.150 
there's no point in having all these
flashlights<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.110> I<00:04:31.710> think<00:04:31.890> about<00:04:31.980> the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
flashlights and I think about the

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.310 
flashlights and I think about the
rechargeable<00:04:32.780> batteries<00:04:33.780> is<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.140> need

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
rechargeable batteries is that you need

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.570 
rechargeable batteries is that you need
some<00:04:34.470> type<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:34.620> solar<00:04:34.920> system<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.460> actually

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
some type of solar system to actually

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.120 
some type of solar system to actually
recharge<00:04:36.030> them<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.990> I'm<00:04:37.530> actually<00:04:37.710> right<00:04:38.010> now

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
recharge them so I'm actually right now

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.480 
recharge them so I'm actually right now
I'm<00:04:38.190> going<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.490> mix<00:04:38.700> mode<00:04:38.940> my<00:04:39.930> next<00:04:40.830> time<00:04:41.040> I'm

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
I'm going to mix mode my next time I'm

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
I'm going to mix mode my next time I'm
going<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.700> actually<00:04:41.820> get<00:04:42.060> some<00:04:42.210> more<00:04:42.390> of<00:04:42.420> these

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
going to actually get some more of these

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.810 
going to actually get some more of these
ala<00:04:42.810> ala<00:04:43.290> batteries<00:04:43.830> which<00:04:43.980> are<00:04:44.070> fantastic

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
ala ala batteries which are fantastic

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.060 
ala ala batteries which are fantastic
I've<00:04:45.180> recharged<00:04:45.990> he<00:04:46.110> seems<00:04:46.410> hundreds<00:04:46.980> of

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
I've recharged he seems hundreds of

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.250 
I've recharged he seems hundreds of
times<00:04:47.310> for<00:04:47.490> my<00:04:47.580> flip<00:04:47.850> video<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.480> gotta<00:04:49.080> say

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
times for my flip video I gotta say

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.470 
times for my flip video I gotta say
they're<00:04:49.560> very<00:04:49.830> reliable<00:04:50.340> this<00:04:51.210> stuff

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
they're very reliable this stuff

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.780 
they're very reliable this stuff
energizer<00:04:51.960> is<00:04:52.170> not<00:04:52.290> as<00:04:52.410> good<00:04:52.620> as<00:04:52.890> antelope

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
energizer is not as good as antelope

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.730 
energizer is not as good as antelope
stuff<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.450> a<00:04:54.480> little<00:04:54.840> batteries<00:04:55.230> i<00:04:55.350> highly

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
stuff the a little batteries i highly

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.140 
stuff the a little batteries i highly
recommend<00:04:57.140> man<00:04:58.140> in<00:04:59.040> video<00:04:59.430> cameras<00:05:00.000> they

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
recommend man in video cameras they

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.480 
recommend man in video cameras they
drain<00:05:00.420> on<00:05:00.600> energy<00:05:00.990> so<00:05:01.230> that's<00:05:02.130> something<00:05:02.310> i

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
drain on energy so that's something i

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.880 
drain on energy so that's something i
would<00:05:02.670> really<00:05:02.790> take<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.270> close<00:05:03.540> look<00:05:03.660> at<00:05:03.930> anyway

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
would really take a close look at anyway

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.930 
would really take a close look at anyway
