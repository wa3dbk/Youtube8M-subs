missing<00:04:45.449> quite<00:04:45.720> a<00:04:45.780> bit<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.229> water<00:04:46.410> so<00:04:47.570> this<00:04:48.570> is

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
missing quite a bit of water so this is

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.570 
missing quite a bit of water so this is
exciting<00:04:49.169> I'm<00:04:49.500> really<00:04:49.740> looking<00:04:50.070> forward<00:04:50.370> to

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
exciting I'm really looking forward to

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.159 
exciting I'm really looking forward to
getting<00:04:50.850> this<00:04:51.060> up<00:04:51.300> and<00:04:51.449> running<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.870> just

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
getting this up and running I just

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.980 
getting this up and running I just
ordered<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.680> two-foot<00:04:53.280> for<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.639> bold<00:04:53.910> t5<00:04:54.449> fixture

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
ordered a two-foot for a bold t5 fixture

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.070 
ordered a two-foot for a bold t5 fixture
that<00:04:55.199> will<00:04:55.349> fit<00:04:55.560> perfectly<00:04:56.160> over<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:57.080> the

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
that will fit perfectly over the the

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.710 
that will fit perfectly over the the
inserts<00:04:58.740> and<00:05:01.280> then<00:05:02.280> not<00:05:02.820> only<00:05:02.849> will<00:05:03.210> but<00:05:03.449> I'd

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
inserts and then not only will but I'd

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.659 
inserts and then not only will but I'd
be<00:05:03.930> able<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.199> clone<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:04.889> take<00:05:05.070> cuttings<00:05:05.340> off

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
be able to clone and take cuttings off

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.900 
be able to clone and take cuttings off
of<00:05:05.880> with<00:05:06.690> this<00:05:06.870> machine<00:05:07.590> then<00:05:07.830> I<00:05:07.949> built<00:05:08.250> but

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
of with this machine then I built but

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.700 
of with this machine then I built but
I'll<00:05:09.060> also<00:05:09.270> be<00:05:09.539> able<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.810> veg<00:05:10.110> out<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.440> little

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
I'll also be able to veg out a little

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.050 
I'll also be able to veg out a little
bit<00:05:10.919> there's<00:05:11.130> quite<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.400> bit<00:05:11.610> of<00:05:11.729> space<00:05:12.000> in

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
bit there's quite a bit of space in

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.290 
bit there's quite a bit of space in
between<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:13.560> inserts<00:05:14.039> so<00:05:14.400> that'll<00:05:14.910> be<00:05:15.060> pretty

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
between the inserts so that'll be pretty

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.360 
between the inserts so that'll be pretty
cool<00:05:15.870> once<00:05:16.110> I<00:05:16.289> get<00:05:16.440> that<00:05:16.590> set<00:05:16.889> up<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.280> then

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
cool once I get that set up and then

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.740 
cool once I get that set up and then
right<00:05:17.550> here<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:19.430> have<00:05:20.430> my<00:05:20.720> Trinidad<00:05:21.720> Moruga

CFL bulb and this little I don't know $9
reflector<00:05:39.840> I<00:05:40.310> planted<00:05:41.310> this<00:05:41.460> one<00:05:41.669> in<00:05:41.820> Coco

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
reflector I planted this one in Coco

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.350 
reflector I planted this one in Coco
with<00:05:42.810> organic<00:05:43.440> nutrients<00:05:44.010> and<00:05:44.580> I<00:05:44.820> have<00:05:45.180> this

with organic nutrients and I have this
little<00:05:45.599> windshield<00:05:46.080> heat<00:05:46.590> reflector<00:05:47.159> thing

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
little windshield heat reflector thing

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.620 
little windshield heat reflector thing
that<00:05:47.669> I<00:05:47.699> bought<00:05:47.970> for<00:05:48.180> a<00:05:48.240> few<00:05:48.479> dollars

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
that I bought for a few dollars

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.550 
that I bought for a few dollars
surrounding<00:05:49.440> it<00:05:50.900> really<00:05:51.900> surprised<00:05:52.260> with<00:05:52.409> how

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
surrounding it really surprised with how

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.500 
surrounding it really surprised with how
much<00:05:52.710> light<00:05:52.979> this<00:05:53.190> reflects<00:05:53.639> back<00:05:53.940> I<00:05:53.970> mean<00:05:54.389> if

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
much light this reflects back I mean if

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.800 
much light this reflects back I mean if
you<00:05:54.599> look<00:05:54.750> at<00:05:54.900> that<00:05:55.050> Bottomly<00:05:55.680> I<00:05:56.449> mean<00:05:57.449> that's

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
you look at that Bottomly I mean that's

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.950 
you look at that Bottomly I mean that's
no<00:05:57.930> that's<00:05:58.770> no<00:05:59.040> reflector<00:05:59.669> right<00:05:59.940> and<00:06:00.540> then

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
no that's no reflector right and then

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.960 
no that's no reflector right and then
with<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.530> reflector<00:06:03.830> it<00:06:04.830> gets<00:06:05.070> quite<00:06:05.580> a<00:06:05.610> bit

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
with the reflector it gets quite a bit

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.030 
with the reflector it gets quite a bit
brighter<00:06:07.820> but<00:06:08.820> anyway<00:06:09.710> this<00:06:10.710> video<00:06:10.860> is

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
brighter but anyway this video is
