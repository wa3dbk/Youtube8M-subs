nice because the leather is both thin
and<00:00:40.350> super<00:00:41.219> supersoft<00:00:41.969> which<00:00:42.540> means<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.960> it

even<00:00:45.629> straight<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.070> box<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.960> after<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
even straight out of the box and after a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.990 
even straight out of the box and after a
few<00:00:49.260> sessions<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:50.010> feels<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.550> you've<00:00:50.730> used

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
few sessions it feels like you've used

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.479 
few sessions it feels like you've used
the<00:00:51.149> plural<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:52.199> years<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.280> leather

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the plural for years because the leather

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.670 
the plural for years because the leather
is<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.940> buttery<00:00:54.360> soft<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.440> feels

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.299 
is so buttery soft that it just feels
plush<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.399> unrestrictive<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> downright

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.980 

now<00:01:12.490> with<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.909> Midford<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.390> he'll<00:01:13.630> be<00:01:13.840> in

now with the Midford and he'll be in
synthetic<00:01:14.920> leather<00:01:15.130> it<00:01:15.340> does<00:01:15.549> feel<00:01:15.909> a<00:01:16.149> little

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
synthetic leather it does feel a little

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.810 
synthetic leather it does feel a little
less<00:01:16.840> premium<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.530> comfortable<00:01:18.369> but<00:01:18.579> on<00:01:18.700> the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
less premium and comfortable but on the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.100 
less premium and comfortable but on the
other<00:01:18.939> hand<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.390> does<00:01:19.570> add<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:19.810> bit<00:01:20.020> of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
other hand it does add a bit of

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.810 
other hand it does add a bit of
stability<00:01:20.259> so<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:21.070> don't<00:01:21.280> move<00:01:21.399> that<00:01:21.460> much

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
stability so you don't move that much

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.510 
stability so you don't move that much
around<00:01:22.330> in<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.689> boot<00:01:22.930> having<00:01:23.860> said<00:01:24.130> that<00:01:24.159> I

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
around in the boot having said that I

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.639 
around in the boot having said that I
would<00:01:24.850> have<00:01:24.939> liked<00:01:25.149> a<00:01:25.330> full<00:01:25.750> leather<00:01:26.140> upper

would have liked a full leather upper

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.980 
would have liked a full leather upper
but<00:01:27.189> for<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.460> price<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.970> chloral<00:01:28.360> it's

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
but for the price of the chloral it's

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.130 
but for the price of the chloral it's
actually<00:01:29.500> alright<00:01:30.430> now<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.479> last<00:01:31.750> on<00:01:32.020> the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
actually alright now the last on the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.340 
actually alright now the last on the
floor<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.619> actually<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.399> big<00:01:34.000> wide<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.689> tad<00:01:35.110> bit

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
floor is actually a big wide a tad bit

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.590 
floor is actually a big wide a tad bit
wider<00:01:35.590> than<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:35.950> one<00:01:36.130> on<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.549> 11pro<00:01:37.119> which

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
wider than the one on the 11pro which

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.149 
wider than the one on the 11pro which
combined<00:01:38.229> with<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.500> fact<00:01:38.679> that<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:38.950> leather

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
combined with the fact that the leather

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.609 
combined with the fact that the leather
stretches<00:01:39.580> a<00:01:39.970> bit<00:01:40.479> means<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.380> glower

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
stretches a bit means that the glower

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.669 
stretches a bit means that the glower
will<00:01:41.860> fit<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.310> lot<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:43.030> people<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.049> if<00:01:44.500> you<00:01:44.649> want

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
will fit a lot of people and if you want

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.199 
will fit a lot of people and if you want
the<00:01:44.950> tightest<00:01:45.310> fit<00:01:45.340> possible<00:01:45.970> which<00:01:46.179> is

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209 
the tightest fit possible which is

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.080 
the tightest fit possible which is
something<00:01:46.569> i<00:01:46.899> like<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.830> should<00:01:48.069> go<00:01:48.220> down<00:01:48.459> half

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090

midsole could have been ever so slightly

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.309

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
ground and actually I really didn't

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.390 
ground and actually I really didn't
notice<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:52.510> stuff<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.350> much<00:02:53.620> when<00:02:54.010> playing

fruit good and bad they do their job
that's<00:02:58.299> pretty<00:02:58.599> much<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.650> around<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.640> ball

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
when you strike the ball and also here

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.690 
when you strike the ball and also here
the<00:03:29.200> tongue<00:03:29.650> helps<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.069> get<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.400> clean

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
especially for those long cross field

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.400 
especially for those long cross field
passes<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.180> by<00:03:37.180> creating<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:37.900> largest

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
passes and by creating that largest

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.410 
passes and by creating that largest
strike<00:03:38.650> zone<00:03:38.920> because<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.030> thin<00:03:40.299> it

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
strike zone because it is so thin it

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.050 
strike zone because it is so thin it
actually<00:03:40.750> doesn't<00:03:40.959> add<00:03:41.290> any<00:03:41.560> bolt<00:03:41.890> at<00:03:42.069> all<00:03:42.370> so

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
actually doesn't add any bolt at all so

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.330 
actually doesn't add any bolt at all so
it's<00:03:43.209> not<00:03:43.359> in<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:43.690> way<00:03:43.840> which<00:03:44.319> is<00:03:44.440> also<00:03:44.799> pretty

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
it's not in the way which is also pretty

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.930 
it's not in the way which is also pretty
cool

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
cool

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.259 
cool
now<00:03:46.450> this<00:03:46.659> elastic<00:03:47.440> strap<00:03:47.769> under<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.760> boot

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
now this elastic strap under the boot

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.180 
now this elastic strap under the boot
might<00:03:49.690> snap<00:03:50.019> at<00:03:50.230> some<00:03:50.470> point<00:03:50.739> but<00:03:50.980> up<00:03:51.069> until

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
might snap at some point but up until

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.610 
might snap at some point but up until
now<00:03:51.370> it's<00:03:51.489> holding<00:03:52.390> up<00:03:52.540> pretty<00:03:52.750> well<00:03:52.930> but

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
now it's holding up pretty well but

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.589 
now it's holding up pretty well but
apart<00:03:54.099> from<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.370> tongue<00:03:54.609> you're<00:03:55.060> pretty<00:03:55.420> much

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
leeway to feel when you strike but in

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.819 
leeway to feel when you strike but in
