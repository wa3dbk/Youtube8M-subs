00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.100
 the party that we started with a very 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.740
 good intensity but with little precision 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.209
 in the first 15 minutes after 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.309
 we improve a bit in the accuracy and 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.740
 we continue with the same intensity 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.090
 showing to be a compact team and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.670
 poor and a half-game team 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.990
 opposite court and we generate what is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.599
 generated in the first time we went in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.339
 advantage I think more than just in 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.380
 the second time the episode of the goal 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.240
 I want to start them back 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.759
 too much we could not press as 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.260
 we made half the court and up 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.970
 in what we did the first time that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.130
 generated that the position of valladolid that 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.150
 It is very good to generate a lot of possession 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.360
 of the opponent's ball and that we 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.570
 back off too 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.200
 consequently the team failed 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.650
 expose what in fact in the first 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.650
 weather 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.930
 efe 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:04.280
 is valorized vitoria 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:07.990
 when you win the way we win 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.090
 we go more and more later 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.020
 then now thinking about the top 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.009
 departure 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.009
 we wait 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.560
 I believe that the party 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.689
 the global 90 minutes was about 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.229
 fair winners after obviously 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.670
 from the possession we can talk about that 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.799
 say go varied in the second time 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.020
 was able to hold a lot of time 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.159
 the ball but in terms of situations 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.200
 of goal we are talking about that in the 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.340
 first time there were at least three in 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.830
 the second time there were two or three 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.649
 previous very dangerous centers and the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.330
 Valladolid goalkeeper I think they were 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.450
 four of highest score of the day of 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.909
 Surely tomorrow was thought match 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.909
 anyone 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.370
 to play each game as if it were the 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.530
 last 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.530
 we are doing this very well
