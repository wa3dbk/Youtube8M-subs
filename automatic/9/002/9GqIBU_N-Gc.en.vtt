00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.330
 the law that is how to take your child to the 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.470
 your mother or your lying at home 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.470
 house of a relative 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.140
 we brought her to the cne because we 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.009
 We wanted to leave not only I would like her but 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.009
 they also educate 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.619
 in both of them and also happy 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.070
 They said goodbye to me when they visited and said 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.070
 see you later 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.510
 and learn that about counting and sharing 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.610
 because that said a lot of minute as well as 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.610
 says linda the acne must be shared 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.450
 one 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.160
 and the one who makes the door and they explain to you 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.350
 he has eaten this has not eaten 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.900
 exactly a lot of tranquility a lot 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.300
 trust and if they are cursed they 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.300
 immediately do not worry mind when 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.600
 it's lamb you're working and 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.150
 makes life a lot easier 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.759
 this center combines the experience of 20 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.979
 years with a day to day affection for 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.220
 we feel that Vega was special 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.220
 here 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.520
 that the girl could be totally 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.010
 involved in what it means to cook 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.170
 work that what she eats is not 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.540
 something that opens the level opposes but gives 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.880
 a process of elaboration had a lot 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.770
 fear with what the dining room seems to be that 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.350
 yes when they leave your house because the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.960
 children are not going to eat and then 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.180
 they recorded it to the major and they taught me 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.240
 the video and bone is that slice up to the 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.900
 arm or he was missing his son sucking the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.900
 plate 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.030
 because I believe that she learns things 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.130
 as soon as I can then let it be 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.840
 cooking like I started in fact here they have 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.350
 made things with flour make the day of 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.880
 the kitchen and then the kitchen of the bar 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.200
 I wanted to sit there and eat with 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.200
 she because she is very pretty and really 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.040
 the values given by the children then to 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.959
 the view is I did not notice that she 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.849
 when they had here activities of thing to 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.500
 the girl did it there at home and 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.500
 I show what I learned in school today 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.130
 it shows that he has a job to work 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.870
 work values companionship 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.810
 and that at this age, it is not 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.370
 very easy for children to play between 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.170
 they 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.200
 the point of view that has the anec 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.060
 to make kids are mature and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.590
 grow and be worth themselves and be 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.590
 autonomous is super important 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.900
 knowing all the people that 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.480
 they form the dane because the truth is that 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.970
 it happens with time and we are still a 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.770
 big family what we notice in 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.170
 she when she talks about her educators she 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:06.410
 has passion for fannie passion for laura 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.910
 amparo I think he sees her as a mother 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:14.240
 I saw here as a family I left 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.340
 My little one in very good hands 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.350
 come here and realize only with the 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.180
 visit with María María's treatment 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.760
 this is the place to educate my daughter 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.790
 our daughter, I think that says so 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.790
 all
