watersheds symbolically as something

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.880 
watersheds symbolically as something
more<00:01:59.700> than<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.540> stream<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.560> area

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
more than a stream and the area

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.770 
more than a stream and the area
surrounding<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.580> I<00:02:02.820> thought<00:02:03.720> that

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
surrounding it I thought that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.780 
surrounding it I thought that
conversation<00:02:04.530> was<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:05.220> rich<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
conversation was really rich and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.330 
conversation was really rich and
powerful<00:02:06.300> in<00:02:06.870> our<00:02:07.110> development<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.800> a<00:02:08.100> team

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
powerful in our development as a team

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.880 
powerful in our development as a team
and<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.050> teachers<00:02:10.350> understanding

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
and and for the teachers understanding

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.740 
and and for the teachers understanding
and<00:02:11.039> developing<00:02:11.130> projects<00:02:11.940> what<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.450> need<00:02:12.630> to

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
and developing projects what we need to

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.990 
and developing projects what we need to
do<00:02:12.870> today<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.640> really<00:02:14.640> formalized<00:02:15.300> our<00:02:17.000> ideas

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
do today is really formalized our ideas

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.840 
do today is really formalized our ideas
about<00:02:18.030> what<00:02:18.330> watersheds<00:02:19.290> are<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.920> what<00:02:20.730> this

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
about what watersheds are and what this

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.880 
about what watersheds are and what this
project<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.360> about<00:02:21.420> one<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.410> students<00:02:22.800> in

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
project is about one of the students in

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.100 
project is about one of the students in
that<00:02:23.010> particular<00:02:23.490> class<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.690> first<00:02:24.900> time<00:02:25.080> I

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
that particular class the first time I

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.300 
that particular class the first time I
ever<00:02:25.320> mentioned<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:25.950> were<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.220> do

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
ever mentioned that we were going to do

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.020 
ever mentioned that we were going to do
this<00:02:26.400> watershed<00:02:26.730> project<00:02:27.270> he<00:02:27.600> said<00:02:28.880> he<00:02:29.880> said

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
this watershed project he said he said

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.210 
this watershed project he said he said
where's<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.330> shed<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:31.530> ranges<00:02:31.890> from<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
where's the shed it ranges from that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.390 
where's the shed it ranges from that
level<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:33.090> kids<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.320> have<00:02:34.530> done<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.070> watershed

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and that's one of the big challenges of

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.930 
and that's one of the big challenges of
teaching<00:02:42.570> here<00:02:42.780> many<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.130> are<00:02:44.370> not<00:02:44.670> really

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
teaching here many of you are not really

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.960 
teaching here many of you are not really

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
accustomed to using topographic maps so

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.340 
accustomed to using topographic maps so
I<00:02:48.000> want<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.239> just<00:02:48.390> kind<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.630> watch<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.110> as<00:02:49.200> you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
I want to just kind of watch you as you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.130 
I want to just kind of watch you as you
try<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.560> find<00:02:49.860> where<00:02:50.760> we<00:02:51.000> are<00:02:51.209> on<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:51.510> map<00:02:51.570> and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
try to find where we are on this map and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.850 
try to find where we are on this map and
where<00:02:52.890> our<00:02:53.030> watershed<00:02:54.030> might<00:02:54.300> be<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:55.590> really

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
where our watershed might be it really

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.820 
where our watershed might be it really
helps<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.160> think<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.610> projects<00:02:57.380> in<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.560> sense

that you're going to plan backwards so

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.000 
that you're going to plan backwards so
you're<00:03:01.050> going<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.260> think<00:03:01.500> about<00:03:01.739> what<00:03:01.890> you

findings<00:06:47.699> in<00:06:48.000> educational<00:06:48.750> research<00:06:48.810> is

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
findings in educational research is

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.499 
findings in educational research is
reflection<00:06:50.250> is<00:06:50.400> equated<00:06:50.940> with<00:06:50.970> retention

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:51.509 
reflection is equated with retention

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:53.809 
reflection is equated with retention
that<00:06:52.289> is<00:06:52.590> when<00:06:52.770> you<00:06:52.889> think<00:06:53.129> about<00:06:53.430> what<00:06:53.610> you've

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 
that is when you think about what you've

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:55.550 
that is when you think about what you've
done<00:06:54.060> and<00:06:54.330> you<00:06:54.389> think<00:06:54.990> about<00:06:55.080> what<00:06:55.409> you

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 
done and you think about what you

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.680 
done and you think about what you
learned<00:06:55.830> it's<00:06:56.099> much<00:06:56.400> more<00:06:56.639> likely<00:06:57.210> to<00:06:57.240> stay

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
learned it's much more likely to stay

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.629 
learned it's much more likely to stay
with<00:06:57.990> you<00:06:58.169> let's<00:06:58.500> start<00:06:58.710> with<00:06:58.830> what<00:06:59.009> worked

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 
with you let's start with what worked

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:02.149 
with you let's start with what worked
I<00:06:59.669> think<00:07:00.509> this<00:07:00.659> watershed<00:07:01.289> project<00:07:01.860> has<00:07:02.009> been

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:02.159 
I think this watershed project has been

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:05.059 
I think this watershed project has been
like<00:07:02.340> the<00:07:03.150> biggest<00:07:03.479> example<00:07:03.960> of<00:07:04.110> how<00:07:04.289> it's

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:05.069 
like the biggest example of how it's

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:07.070 
like the biggest example of how it's
good<00:07:05.310> to<00:07:05.970> work<00:07:06.090> together<00:07:06.270> in<00:07:06.569> groups<00:07:06.599> and

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 
good to work together in groups and

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.649 
good to work together in groups and
that's<00:07:07.289> successful<00:07:07.770> that<00:07:08.069> can<00:07:08.190> be<00:07:08.340> I<00:07:08.669> would

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:09.659 
that's successful that can be I would

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:11.629 
that's successful that can be I would
actually<00:07:09.810> have<00:07:10.110> to<00:07:10.259> say<00:07:10.289> that<00:07:10.800> our<00:07:11.099> group

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 
actually have to say that our group

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.529 
actually have to say that our group
didn't<00:07:12.509> work<00:07:12.690> very<00:07:12.720> well<00:07:13.139> together<00:07:13.500> and<00:07:13.919> that

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
didn't work very well together and that

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:20.270 
didn't work very well together and that
we<00:07:15.539> didn't<00:07:16.199> manage<00:07:16.500> our<00:07:17.370> time<00:07:17.789> wisely<00:07:18.569> and<00:07:19.280> it

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
we didn't manage our time wisely and it

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.710 
we didn't manage our time wisely and it
seemed<00:07:20.669> like<00:07:20.699> we<00:07:20.849> worked<00:07:21.240> better<00:07:21.449> by

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
seemed like we worked better by

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.170 
seemed like we worked better by
ourselves<00:07:22.139> I<00:07:22.620> just<00:07:22.979> want<00:07:23.159> to<00:07:23.250> see<00:07:23.430> them<00:07:23.610> really
