one GP 2007 could be traded for 1k on
the<00:01:06.119> EOC<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> buy<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> hundred<00:01:07.920> K<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> old

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the EOC so to buy a hundred K on the old

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.429 
the EOC so to buy a hundred K on the old
school<00:01:08.880> you'd<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.540> pay<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> hundred<00:01:09.930> mil

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
school you'd have to pay a hundred mil

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.520 
school you'd have to pay a hundred mil
on<00:01:10.650> ELC<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.400> trade<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:13.020> these<00:01:13.170> rates

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
on ELC to trade for that so these rates

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.080 
on ELC to trade for that so these rates
have<00:01:13.770> slowly<00:01:14.040> dropped<00:01:14.369> towards<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.729> present

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
have slowly dropped towards the present

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.850 
have slowly dropped towards the present
day<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.720> gold<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.110> introduced<00:01:16.500> into<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
day as more gold as introduced into the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.429 
day as more gold as introduced into the
2007<00:01:17.580> game<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.659> currently<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> rate<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
2007 game and currently the rate I

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.039 
2007 game and currently the rate I
believe<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.920> between<00:01:20.280> 1<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> 25<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.479> 1<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.840> 30

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
believe is between 1 to 25 and 1 to 30

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.609 
believe is between 1 to 25 and 1 to 30
which<00:01:22.650> basically<00:01:22.950> means<00:01:23.220> 1<00:01:23.549> GP<00:01:23.840> 2007<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:25.439> be

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
which basically means 1 GP 2007 can be

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.020 
which basically means 1 GP 2007 can be
seen<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.189> equivalent<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.729> 30<00:01:27.360> GP<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.380> see

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
seen as the equivalent of 30 GP you see

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.730 
seen as the equivalent of 30 GP you see
so<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> real<00:01:30.390> example<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.079> would<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
so a real example of this would be to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.190 
so a real example of this would be to
buy<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.310> mill<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.700> 2007<00:01:33.360> money<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.049> could

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
buy one mill in 2007 money so we could

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.580 
buy one mill in 2007 money so we could
trade<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.770> 30<00:01:35.040> mil<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> live<00:01:35.909> game

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
trade that for 30 mil in the live game

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.840 
trade that for 30 mil in the live game
so<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.650> may<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.770> wondering<00:01:37.890> where<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.610> people

so you may be wondering where do people

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.760 
so you may be wondering where do people
do<00:01:39.000> trades<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.600> people<00:01:40.409> wanting<00:01:40.710> a

new form of clans into the game the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.609 
new form of clans into the game the
biggest<00:01:44.700> one<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.000> could<00:01:45.030> find<00:01:45.329> was<00:01:45.600> GP<00:01:46.290> stole

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
biggest one I could find was GP stole

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.990 
biggest one I could find was GP stole
which<00:01:46.920> nearly<00:01:47.159> always<00:01:47.490> has<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> full<00:01:47.820> client
