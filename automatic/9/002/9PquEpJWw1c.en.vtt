00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.550 

driver<00:01:46.369> looks<00:01:46.670> like<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.090> for<00:01:47.360> stop

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.380 

I<00:01:53.649> think<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.040> American<00:01:54.430> League<00:01:54.610> is<00:01:54.909> so

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
I think the American League is so

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.950 
I think the American League is so
important<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:55.869> think<00:01:55.960> coming<00:01:56.350> from<00:01:56.380> jr.<00:01:56.950> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
important I think coming from jr. and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.200 
important I think coming from jr. and
going<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.110> pro<00:01:59.290> hockey<00:01:59.560> I<00:01:59.799> think<00:02:00.159> it<00:02:01.030> really

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
going to pro hockey I think it really

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.760 
going to pro hockey I think it really
gets<00:02:01.540> you<00:02:01.979> prepared<00:02:02.979> for<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.250> grind<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
gets you prepared for the grind and you

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.609 
gets you prepared for the grind and you
know<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.759> physical<00:02:06.970> part<00:02:07.450> of<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.810> game<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.380> so

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
know the physical part of the game is so

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.830 
know the physical part of the game is so
much<00:02:08.739> different<00:02:09.130> from<00:02:09.190> junior<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:09.849> then<00:02:10.269> also

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
much different from junior and then also

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.380 
much different from junior and then also
you<00:02:11.739> know<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.980> coaching<00:02:12.430> doing<00:02:12.760> video<00:02:13.090> and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
you know the coaching doing video and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.699 
you know the coaching doing video and
all<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:13.989> American<00:02:14.410> League<00:02:14.560> is

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
all that so the American League is

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.620 
all that so the American League is
really<00:02:14.920> important<00:02:15.340> for<00:02:15.580> for<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.480> make

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630
