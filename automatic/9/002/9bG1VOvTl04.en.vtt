first first impression on FC is that was
$18<00:05:31.950> a<00:05:32.040> month<00:05:32.280> is<00:05:32.460> doable<00:05:33.000> for<00:05:33.180> me<00:05:33.450> even<00:05:33.630> though

$18 a month is doable for me even though

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.750 
$18 a month is doable for me even though
cheap<00:05:34.230> i<00:05:34.560> guess<00:05:34.740> like<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:35.250> it's<00:05:35.520> a<00:05:35.580> little

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
cheap i guess like it it's a little

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.910 
cheap i guess like it it's a little
pricey<00:05:36.000> when<00:05:36.330> I<00:05:36.360> guess<00:05:36.510> it's<00:05:36.930> doable<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:37.740> it

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
pricey when I guess it's doable and it

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.220 
pricey when I guess it's doable and it
it's<00:05:38.220> really<00:05:38.610> good<00:05:38.760> for<00:05:39.240> a<00:05:39.300> female's<00:05:39.690> products
