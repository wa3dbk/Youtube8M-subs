let's<00:00:13.820> talk<00:00:13.970> about<00:00:14.120> speed<00:00:14.540> picking<00:00:15.130> now

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
let's talk about speed picking now

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.430 
let's talk about speed picking now
everybody<00:00:16.550> wants<00:00:16.760> to<00:00:16.820> play<00:00:17.000> fast<00:00:17.240> but<00:00:18.170> playing

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
everybody wants to play fast but playing

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.930 
everybody wants to play fast but playing
fast<00:00:18.770> is<00:00:19.070> not<00:00:19.220> the<00:00:19.400> only<00:00:19.430> thing<00:00:19.610> that's

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
fast is not the only thing that's

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.519 
fast is not the only thing that's
important<00:00:20.420> you<00:00:20.480> also<00:00:20.810> need<00:00:20.990> to<00:00:21.020> play<00:00:21.260> with<00:00:21.500> our

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
important you also need to play with our

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.929 
important you also need to play with our
articulation<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:23.180> accuracy<00:00:23.990> and<00:00:24.640> bio<00:00:25.640> tick

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
articulation and accuracy and bio tick

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.490 
articulation and accuracy and bio tick
ulation<00:00:26.360> I<00:00:26.480> mean<00:00:26.660> that<00:00:26.810> you're<00:00:26.930> able<00:00:27.050> to<00:00:27.290> hear

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
ulation I mean that you're able to hear

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.200 
ulation I mean that you're able to hear
the<00:00:27.619> notes<00:00:27.860> distinctly<00:00:28.520> that<00:00:28.880> it's<00:00:29.029> not<00:00:29.150> just

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
the notes distinctly that it's not just

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.280 
the notes distinctly that it's not just
a<00:00:29.509> muddy<00:00:29.840> mess<00:00:30.189> of<00:00:31.189> notes<00:00:32.200> jumbled<00:00:33.200> together

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
a muddy mess of notes jumbled together

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.319 
a muddy mess of notes jumbled together
and<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.400> one<00:00:34.579> of<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.730> ways<00:00:34.760> you<00:00:35.090> can<00:00:35.240> improve

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
and so one of the ways you can improve

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.750 
and so one of the ways you can improve
your<00:00:35.570> accuracy<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:36.320> your<00:00:36.530> articulation<00:00:37.130> and

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
your accuracy and your articulation and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.819 
your accuracy and your articulation and
your<00:00:37.940> speed<00:00:38.239> is<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:39.170> do<00:00:39.320> like<00:00:39.500> repetitive

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
your speed is to do like repetitive

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.670 
your speed is to do like repetitive

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
you can do is to do a four note exercise

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.119 
you can do is to do a four note exercise
on<00:00:52.489> each<00:00:52.820> string<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:53.510> this<00:00:54.410> will<00:00:54.559> help<00:00:54.590> you

I show you the exercise a lot of guys
mess<00:01:02.690> up<00:01:02.899> because<00:01:03.079> they<00:01:03.379> hold<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.769> pig<00:01:03.980> way

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220

too<00:01:04.280> tight<00:01:04.760> now<00:01:05.480> I've<00:01:05.570> got<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:05.780> really<00:01:05.990> big<00:01:06.290> pick

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
too tight now I've got a really big pick

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.070 
too tight now I've got a really big pick
you<00:01:06.830> can't<00:01:07.040> really<00:01:07.220> tell<00:01:07.520> from<00:01:07.820> this<00:01:08.780> camera

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
you can't really tell from this camera

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.320 
you can't really tell from this camera
angle<00:01:09.440> i'm<00:01:09.560> sure<00:01:09.800> i<00:01:10.100> don't<00:01:10.520> have<00:01:10.850> high<00:01:11.030> tech

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
angle i'm sure i don't have high tech

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.540 
angle i'm sure i don't have high tech
video<00:01:11.810> equipment<00:01:12.500> but<00:01:12.980> this<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.280> pretty

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
video equipment but this is a pretty

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.850 
video equipment but this is a pretty
thick<00:01:13.850> pic<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:14.900> it<00:01:15.020> has<00:01:15.170> nothing<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.590> do<00:01:15.710> with

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
thick pic so it has nothing to do with

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.999 
thick pic so it has nothing to do with
having<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.189> super<00:01:16.549> thin<00:01:16.790> pick<00:01:17.650> actually<00:01:18.650> i<00:01:18.680> find

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
having a super thin pick actually i find

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.160 
having a super thin pick actually i find
that<00:01:19.159> having<00:01:19.369> a<00:01:19.549> thicker<00:01:19.820> pick<00:01:20.170> actually

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
that having a thicker pick actually

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.440 
that having a thicker pick actually
helps<00:01:21.530> me<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.890> have<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.220> proper<00:01:22.610> grip<00:01:22.850> because

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
helps me to have the proper grip because

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.080 
helps me to have the proper grip because
i<00:01:23.720> can't<00:01:23.990> hold<00:01:24.320> on<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:24.829> super<00:01:25.579> heavy<00:01:25.790> pick

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
i can't hold on to this super heavy pick

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.660 
i can't hold on to this super heavy pick
really<00:01:26.960> tight<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.530> have<00:01:27.860> any<00:01:28.100> kind<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.399> motion

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
really tight and have any kind of motion

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.039 
really tight and have any kind of motion
on<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.119> strings<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:30.380> fluidity<00:01:30.909> so<00:01:32.049> having

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
on the strings and fluidity so having

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.929 
on the strings and fluidity so having
this<00:01:33.170> thick<00:01:33.439> pick<00:01:33.710> reminds<00:01:34.220> me<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.520> I've<00:01:34.759> got

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
this thick pick reminds me that I've got

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.300 
this thick pick reminds me that I've got
to<00:01:35.000> have<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.149> kind<00:01:35.329> of<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.509> soft<00:01:35.810> grip<00:01:36.140> not<00:01:37.040> so

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
to have a kind of a soft grip not so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.090 
to have a kind of a soft grip not so
soft<00:01:37.579> that<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:37.790> drop<00:01:38.119> it<00:01:38.360> obviously<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.829> soft

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
soft that I drop it obviously the soft

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.700 
soft that I drop it obviously the soft
enough<00:01:40.399> to<00:01:40.579> where<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:40.759> can<00:01:40.820> move<00:01:41.710> definitely

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
enough to where I can move definitely

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.390 
enough to where I can move definitely
along<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.219> string

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.540 

so<00:01:50.300> here<00:01:50.740> having<00:01:51.740> said<00:01:51.950> that<00:01:51.980> here's<00:01:52.400> the

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
so here having said that here's the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.610 
so here having said that here's the
four-note<00:01:52.910> exercise<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:54.140> I'm<00:01:54.290> going<00:01:54.440> to<00:01:54.500> move

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
four-note exercise and I'm going to move

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.590 
four-note exercise and I'm going to move
it<00:01:54.770> across<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.040> strings<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:55.790> what<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.420> want

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
it across the strings and what you want

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.970 
it across the strings and what you want
to<00:01:56.630> do<00:01:56.750> is<00:01:56.870> to<00:01:56.960> take<00:01:57.140> this<00:01:57.320> all<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.560> way<00:01:57.680> up<00:01:57.860> to

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
to do is to take this all the way up to

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:09.169 
to do is to take this all the way up to
the<00:01:58.010> 12th<00:01:58.220> fret<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:58.820> move<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.150> back<00:01:59.300> down

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:18.650 

and<00:02:09.299> slowly<00:02:10.229> all<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.769> is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.150 

and<00:02:19.660> make<00:02:19.870> sure<00:02:19.900> you're<00:02:20.200> picking<00:02:20.590> every<00:02:20.950> note

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
and make sure you're picking every note

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.610 
and make sure you're picking every note
and<00:02:21.400> listening<00:02:22.120> for<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:22.750> it's<00:02:23.170> really<00:02:23.440> better

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and listening for it it's really better

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.230 
and listening for it it's really better
if<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.920> don't<00:02:24.010> use<00:02:24.220> distortion<00:02:24.850> I've<00:02:25.030> just

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
if you don't use distortion I've just

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.510 
if you don't use distortion I've just
got<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.630> for<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:25.990> example<00:02:26.350> but<00:02:27.190> as<00:02:27.310> better

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
got it on for this example but as better

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.860 
got it on for this example but as better
if<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.790> can<00:02:27.880> play<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.090> clean<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.690> way<00:02:28.810> you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
if you can play it clean that way you

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.630 
if you can play it clean that way you
can<00:02:29.050> hear<00:02:29.260> every<00:02:29.530> note<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.890> tell<00:02:30.340> if<00:02:30.520> you're

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
can hear every note and tell if you're

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.670 
can hear every note and tell if you're
messing<00:02:30.970> up<00:02:31.060> anything<00:02:31.380> another<00:02:32.380> thing<00:02:32.590> you

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
messing up anything another thing you

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.150 
messing up anything another thing you
can<00:02:32.800> do<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.130> three<00:02:33.490> note<00:02:33.730> exercise<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
can do is a three note exercise and the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.220 
can do is a three note exercise and the
reason<00:02:36.459> this<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.640> beneficial<00:02:37.300> it's<00:02:37.870> because

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
reason this is beneficial it's because

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.830 
reason this is beneficial it's because
it's<00:02:38.410> an<00:02:38.530> odd<00:02:38.770> number<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.280> notes<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.480> you're

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
it's an odd number of notes so you're

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.110 
it's an odd number of notes so you're
going<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.050> end<00:02:41.380> on<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.740> Down<00:02:42.070> stroke<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.790> on<00:02:43.000> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
going to end on a Down stroke and on the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.340 
going to end on a Down stroke and on the
next<00:02:43.450> string<00:02:43.630> you're<00:02:43.810> going<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.990> begin<00:02:44.200> with

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
next string you're going to begin with

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.170 
next string you're going to begin with
an<00:02:44.470> upstroke<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.820> want<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.060> get

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
an upstroke and so you want to get

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.970 
an upstroke and so you want to get
proficient<00:02:46.600> with<00:02:47.050> with<00:02:47.380> your<00:02:47.560> down<00:02:47.770> up

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
proficient with with your down up

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.970 
proficient with with your down up
picking<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.640> using<00:02:49.300> those<00:02:49.420> 33<00:02:50.380> notes<00:02:50.650> as

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
picking and using those 33 notes as

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.440 
picking and using those 33 notes as
opposed<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.520> four<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.970> going<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.180> challenge

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
opposed to four is going to challenge

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:04.860 
opposed to four is going to challenge
that

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.460 

and<00:03:06.390> practice<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.870> like<00:03:08.049> I<00:03:08.140> said<00:03:08.200> take

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
and practice that and like I said take

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.289 
and practice that and like I said take
it<00:03:08.530> up<00:03:08.739> to<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.860> 12th<00:03:09.069> fret<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.970> bring<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.269> back

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299

down and I guarantee if you do that

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.640
