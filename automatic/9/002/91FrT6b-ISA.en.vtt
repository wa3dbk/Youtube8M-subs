00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
things like that so we're we're a bit of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.940 
things like that so we're we're a bit of
a<00:02:46.310> convert<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.880> guess<00:02:47.060> max<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:48.530> idea<00:02:48.830> of

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
a convert I guess max to the the idea of

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.050 
a convert I guess max to the the idea of
pisa<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:50.019> console<00:02:51.019> gaming<00:02:51.880> playstation<00:02:52.880> 2<00:02:53.030> and

pisa of console gaming playstation 2 and
playstation<00:02:53.959> 3<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.340> that's<00:02:55.340> been<00:02:55.549> dominated

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
playstation 3 and that's been dominated

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.300

by<00:02:56.330> studio<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:56.959> little<00:02:57.290> ball<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.650> course<00:02:57.890> and

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
by studio a little ball of course and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.050 
by studio a little ball of course and
sony<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.739> those<00:03:01.130> games<00:03:01.400> have<00:03:01.610> been<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.760> little

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
sony and those games have been a little

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.050 
sony and those games have been a little
bit<00:03:02.239> arcade<00:03:02.660> but<00:03:02.900> it's<00:03:03.620> okay<00:03:04.010> i<00:03:04.190> mean<00:03:04.400> it's

seriously<00:04:24.720> sure<00:04:25.230> and<00:04:25.470> hopefully<00:04:26.220> codemasters

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
seriously sure and hopefully codemasters

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.700 
seriously sure and hopefully codemasters
will<00:04:27.360> go<00:04:27.510> in<00:04:27.570> that<00:04:27.720> direction<00:04:27.930> they've<00:04:28.500> got

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
will go in that direction they've got

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.510 
will go in that direction they've got
their<00:04:28.920> game<00:04:29.190> grid<00:04:29.660> race<00:04:30.660> car<00:04:30.930> grid<00:04:31.520> where

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
their game grid race car grid where

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.090 
their game grid race car grid where
they're<00:04:32.670> going<00:04:32.790> to<00:04:32.850> use<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:33.630> model<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.530> build

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
they're going to use that model to build

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.680 
they're going to use that model to build
the<00:04:35.310> HD<00:04:35.850> Aaron<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:36.750> yeah<00:04:37.310> so<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:39.300> know<00:04:39.420> there's

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
the HD Aaron so yeah so you know there's

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.940 
the HD Aaron so yeah so you know there's
that<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.050> look<00:04:40.080> forward<00:04:40.200> to<00:04:40.620> i<00:04:40.650> guess<00:04:40.920> like

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
that to look forward to i guess like

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.700 
that to look forward to i guess like
back<00:04:41.430> games<00:04:41.640> coming<00:04:41.940> out<00:04:42.150> pretty<00:04:42.750> much<00:04:42.900> now<00:04:43.260> so

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
back games coming out pretty much now so

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.890 
back games coming out pretty much now so
that<00:04:44.550> looks<00:04:44.820> really<00:04:45.120> good<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.720> make

that looks really good it make

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.840 
that looks really good it make
codemasters<00:04:46.560> i<00:04:46.590> got<00:04:46.830> runs<00:04:47.070> on<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.370> board<00:04:47.400> with

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
codemasters i got runs on the board with

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.530 
codemasters i got runs on the board with
toka<00:04:48.270> or<00:04:48.420> and<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:49.230> know<00:04:49.350> colin<00:04:49.740> mcrae<00:04:50.010> dirt

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
know how to how to build a good game so

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.409 
know how to how to build a good game so
I've<00:04:55.830> got<00:04:56.100> every<00:04:56.370> every<00:04:56.820> faith<00:04:57.060> in<00:04:57.090> and

I've got every every faith in and

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:58.460 
I've got every every faith in and
they're<00:04:57.540> very<00:04:57.570> confident<00:04:58.110> in<00:04:58.169> them<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:58.410> I

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
they're very confident in them and I

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
they're very confident in them and I
think<00:04:58.710> all<00:04:58.860> come<00:04:59.669> 2009<00:05:00.540> mate<00:05:00.810> it'll<00:05:01.340> well<00:05:02.340> I

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
think all come 2009 mate it'll well I

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.400 
think all come 2009 mate it'll well I
think<00:05:02.610> we'll<00:05:02.820> be<00:05:02.850> surprised<00:05:03.390> how<00:05:03.960> good<00:05:04.020> it<00:05:04.290> is

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
think we'll be surprised how good it is

think we'll be surprised how good it is
yeah<00:05:04.980> I<00:05:05.010> think<00:05:05.430> if<00:05:05.550> they<00:05:05.669> can<00:05:05.850> get<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.150> mix

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
yeah I think if they can get the mix

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.690 
yeah I think if they can get the mix
right<00:05:06.600> between<00:05:07.140> you<00:05:07.620> know<00:05:07.740> having<00:05:08.040> good<00:05:08.340> some

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
right between you know having good some

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.870 
right between you know having good some
easy<00:05:09.330> arcade<00:05:10.290> mode<00:05:10.560> for<00:05:10.919> new<00:05:11.130> people<00:05:11.340> but<00:05:11.820> also

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
easy arcade mode for new people but also

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.580 
easy arcade mode for new people but also
for<00:05:12.300> those<00:05:12.419> who<00:05:12.660> want<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:12.960> really<00:05:13.169> play<00:05:13.470> the

it is and we've got a thread on this at

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.710 
it is and we've got a thread on this at
the<00:05:18.540> moment<00:05:18.900> with<00:05:19.050> ender<00:05:19.830> f1<00:05:20.480> where<00:05:21.480> we've

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
the moment with ender f1 where we've

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.110 
the moment with ender f1 where we've
written<00:05:21.930> a<00:05:22.080> lot<00:05:22.200> of<00:05:22.320> ideas<00:05:22.470> about<00:05:23.040> f1<00:05:23.250> games<00:05:23.700> so

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
written a lot of ideas about f1 games so

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.670 
written a lot of ideas about f1 games so
check<00:05:24.450> check<00:05:24.870> that<00:05:25.050> out<00:05:25.080> that<00:05:25.500> at<00:05:26.100> Endor<00:05:26.910> f1

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
check check that out that at Endor f1

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.860 
check check that out that at Endor f1
there's<00:05:28.680> so<00:05:28.830> much<00:05:28.950> more<00:05:29.160> they<00:05:29.340> could<00:05:29.610> do<00:05:29.870> let's

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
there's so much more they could do let's

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.840 
there's so much more they could do let's
just<00:05:30.990> see<00:05:31.320> if<00:05:31.350> they<00:05:31.530> can<00:05:31.710> do<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:31.890> but<00:05:32.160> we're

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
just see if they can do it but we're

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.270 
just see if they can do it but we're
playing<00:05:33.180> max<00:05:33.450> that<00:05:33.690> codemasters<00:05:34.350> can<00:05:34.560> do<00:05:34.710> it

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
playing max that codemasters can do it

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.430 
playing max that codemasters can do it
each<00:05:35.340> other<00:05:35.550> yeah<00:05:36.030> but<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.870> meantime<00:05:37.050> last

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440
