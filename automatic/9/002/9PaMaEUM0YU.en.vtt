date my chart focus mine says he was
made<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:33.890> 1996<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.570> for<00:00:36.570> what<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> gathered

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
made in 1996 so for what I gathered

made in 1996 so for what I gathered
around<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:38.940> made<00:00:40.040> 1996<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.219> when<00:00:41.430> they

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
around I think made 1996 is when they

this wire this has a cloth sleeve over
it

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
it

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.999

get<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.250> blade<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:43.850> cut<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:45.050> sleeve<00:01:45.380> or<00:01:45.650> try<00:01:45.979> to

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
get a blade and cut the sleeve or try to

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.469 
get a blade and cut the sleeve or try to
only<00:01:46.310> cut<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.520> sleeve<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.000> not<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.300> wires

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
only cut the sleeve and not the wires

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.680 
only cut the sleeve and not the wires
inside<00:01:47.690> so<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.229> can<00:01:48.850> split<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.970> sleeve<00:01:50.390> and

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
inside so I can split the sleeve and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.109 
inside so I can split the sleeve and
look<00:01:50.960> inside<00:01:51.259> on<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.530> wires<00:01:51.740> if<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.880> wires

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
look inside on the wires if the wires

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.680 
look inside on the wires if the wires
are<00:01:53.479> if<00:01:53.840> any<00:01:54.170> like<00:01:54.530> powder<00:01:54.800> or<00:01:55.369> if<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.479> see

throttle<00:02:45.890> actuator<00:02:46.280> which<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.850> under<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.299> then

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
throttle actuator which is under it then

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.340 
throttle actuator which is under it then
most<00:02:49.400> likely<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:49.970> your<00:02:50.299> your<00:02:50.780> wire<00:02:50.959> harness

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
most likely it is your your wire harness

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.150 
most likely it is your your wire harness
because<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:52.549> is<00:02:53.019> bonded<00:02:54.019> together<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.500> last

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
because it is bonded together the last

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.060 
because it is bonded together the last
air<00:02:55.340> flow<00:02:55.489> sensor<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.269> echo<00:02:57.079> electronic

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
bottle actuator they go to the same loom

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.330 
bottle actuator they go to the same loom
so<00:03:01.760> if<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.540> get<00:03:02.720> any<00:03:02.840> codes<00:03:03.680> pointing<00:03:04.250> to

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
so if you get any codes pointing to

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.640 
so if you get any codes pointing to
either<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.730> mass<00:03:05.570> airflow<00:03:05.750> sensor<00:03:05.959> or<00:03:06.410> the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
either the mass airflow sensor or the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.990 
either the mass airflow sensor or the
ETA<00:03:07.190> then<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:09.230> can<00:03:09.440> either<00:03:09.530> be<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.829> bad<00:03:10.160> total

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
ETA then it can either be a bad total

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.720 
ETA then it can either be a bad total

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
on these post 95 cars because the around

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.670 
on these post 95 cars because the around
95<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.670> before<00:03:53.030> that<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.989> ETA<00:03:54.349> is<00:03:54.650> a

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
95 and before that the ETA is a

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.949 
95 and before that the ETA is a
different<00:03:55.250> shape<00:03:55.549> and<00:03:55.790> pretty<00:03:56.480> much<00:03:56.569> bigger

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
different shape and pretty much bigger

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.440 
different shape and pretty much bigger
than<00:03:57.319> what<00:03:57.829> we<00:03:57.920> have<00:03:58.040> on<00:03:58.159> these<00:03:58.280> post<00:03:58.549> 95<00:03:59.180> cars

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
than what we have on these post 95 cars

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.569 
than what we have on these post 95 cars
so<00:04:00.290> it's<00:04:00.470> pretty<00:04:00.620> easy<00:04:00.799> took<00:04:01.099> me<00:04:01.190> about<00:04:01.340> 10

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
so it's pretty easy took me about 10

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.190 
so it's pretty easy took me about 10
minutes<00:04:01.609> to<00:04:01.849> take<00:04:02.030> out<00:04:02.180> it's<00:04:02.450> just<00:04:02.629> you<00:04:02.840> how<00:04:03.140> to

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
minutes to take out it's just you how to

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.259 
minutes to take out it's just you how to
have<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:04.099> right<00:04:04.310> tools<00:04:04.579> when<00:04:05.000> I<00:04:05.030> say<00:04:05.180> the

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
have the right tools when I say the

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.619 
have the right tools when I say the
right<00:04:05.390> tool<00:04:05.569> I<00:04:05.629> mean<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:07.000> 1/4<00:04:08.000> extension<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.349> a

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
right tool I mean a 1/4 extension and a

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.390 
right tool I mean a 1/4 extension and a
swivel<00:04:11.629> socket<00:04:12.079> or<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.260> universal<00:04:13.159> joint

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
swivel socket or a universal joint

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.170 
swivel socket or a universal joint
really<00:04:14.030> helps<00:04:14.389> when<00:04:14.629> you're<00:04:14.810> getting<00:04:15.769> the

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
really helps when you're getting the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.500 
really helps when you're getting the
boot<00:04:17.180> off<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.949> MAF<00:04:18.949> under<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.639> once<00:04:20.419> you

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
boot off the MAF under it and once you

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.939 
boot off the MAF under it and once you
get<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.840> ETA<00:04:21.440> ETA<00:04:22.250> out<00:04:22.900> there's<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:23.990> side<00:04:24.620> cover

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
get the ETA ETA out there's a side cover

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.129 
get the ETA ETA out there's a side cover
I<00:04:25.310> wish<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.669> still<00:04:25.850> had<00:04:25.910> mine<00:04:26.240> out<00:04:26.270> there's<00:04:27.020> a

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
I wish I still had mine out there's a

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.300 
I wish I still had mine out there's a

are located on it you want to inspect

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.330 
are located on it you want to inspect
the<00:04:34.520> wires<00:04:34.760> go<00:04:35.270> into<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.570> motor<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:36.250> see<00:04:37.250> if

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
the wires go into the motor and see if

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.180 
the wires go into the motor and see if
the<00:04:37.490> gears<00:04:37.789> are<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.570> mean<00:04:39.500> if<00:04:39.620> there's<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:39.919> -

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
the gears are I mean if there's a -

teeth missing on the gears or not mind
checked<00:04:43.190> out<00:04:43.310> ok<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.760> wires<00:04:44.000> were<00:04:44.270> fine<00:04:44.599> there

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
checked out ok the wires were fine there

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.450 
checked out ok the wires were fine there
was<00:04:45.349> no<00:04:45.880> corrosion<00:04:46.880> on<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.270> solder<00:04:47.570> points<00:04:47.870> or

was no corrosion on the solder points or
missing<00:04:49.460> teeth<00:04:49.490> so<00:04:49.970> what<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:50.240> did<00:04:50.360> was<00:04:50.720> just<00:04:51.110> to

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
missing teeth so what I did was just to

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.040 
missing teeth so what I did was just to
be<00:04:51.889> safe<00:04:52.070> I<00:04:52.310> refloat<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.849> solder<00:04:53.270> points<00:04:53.510> for

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
be safe I refloat the solder points for

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.770 
be safe I refloat the solder points for
the<00:04:54.139> wires<00:04:54.320> going<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:54.860> and<00:04:55.330> I<00:04:56.330> gave<00:04:56.539> the

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
the wires going to it and I gave the

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.950 
the wires going to it and I gave the
gear<00:04:57.169> my<00:04:57.440> might<00:04:58.280> has<00:04:58.460> plastic<00:04:58.699> gears<00:04:59.150> I've

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
gear my might has plastic gears I've

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.860 
gear my might has plastic gears I've
seen<00:05:00.260> some<00:05:00.560> with<00:05:00.740> metal<00:05:01.039> gears<00:05:01.280> so<00:05:02.240> I<00:05:02.539> put<00:05:02.840> a

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
seen some with metal gears so I put a

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.219 
seen some with metal gears so I put a
little<00:05:03.110> bit<00:05:03.349> of<00:05:04.210> lubrication<00:05:05.210> on<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.900> gears

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
little bit of lubrication on the gears

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.830 
little bit of lubrication on the gears
that<00:05:06.530> are<00:05:06.590> plastic<00:05:06.949> safe<00:05:07.400> and<00:05:07.910> I<00:05:08.539> put<00:05:08.720> it<00:05:08.810> back

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
that are plastic safe and I put it back

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.460 
that are plastic safe and I put it back
together<00:05:09.080> and<00:05:09.530> I<00:05:10.479> of<00:05:11.479> course<00:05:11.780> use<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.289> new

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
together and I of course use the new

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.490 
together and I of course use the new
gasket<00:05:12.979> for<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.430> ETA<00:05:14.000> because<00:05:14.900> since<00:05:15.349> our

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
gasket for the ETA because since our

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.129 
gasket for the ETA because since our
cars<00:05:15.770> are<00:05:16.039> I<00:05:16.250> mean<00:05:16.400> my<00:05:16.490> cars<00:05:16.729> at<00:05:17.139> around

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
cars are I mean my cars at around

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.010 
cars are I mean my cars at around
200,000<00:05:18.949> miles<00:05:19.120> so<00:05:20.120> of<00:05:20.270> course<00:05:20.449> the<00:05:20.690> gasket

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
200,000 miles so of course the gasket

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.200 
200,000 miles so of course the gasket
would<00:05:21.139> be<00:05:21.289> pretty<00:05:21.800> much<00:05:21.919> gone<00:05:22.130> by<00:05:22.310> now<00:05:22.460> so<00:05:23.180> I

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
would be pretty much gone by now so I

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.029 
would be pretty much gone by now so I
replace<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.599> gasket<00:05:23.780> when<00:05:24.050> lifting<00:05:24.889> off<00:05:25.010> the

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
replace the gasket when lifting off the

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.510 
replace the gasket when lifting off the
ETA<00:05:25.580> I<00:05:25.909> put<00:05:26.810> it<00:05:26.900> back<00:05:26.960> in<00:05:27.199> and<00:05:27.500> I<00:05:27.949> was<00:05:28.220> still

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
ETA I put it back in and I was still

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.250 
ETA I put it back in and I was still
having<00:05:28.849> a<00:05:29.030> limp<00:05:29.210> home<00:05:29.360> mode<00:05:29.599> which<00:05:30.139> is

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
having a limp home mode which is

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.189 
having a limp home mode which is
unfortunate<00:05:30.820> so<00:05:31.820> I<00:05:31.849> went<00:05:32.180> on<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:32.750> researched

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
unfortunate so I went on and researched

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:38.020 
unfortunate so I went on and researched
more<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.740> found<00:05:34.699> out<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:35.150> um<00:05:36.190> that<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:37.610> ETA

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
more I found out that um that the ETA

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.670 
more I found out that um that the ETA
and<00:05:38.270> mass<00:05:38.479> airflow<00:05:38.720> sensor<00:05:38.930> are<00:05:39.289> sensitive<00:05:39.620> to

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
and mass airflow sensor are sensitive to

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.810 
and mass airflow sensor are sensitive to
any<00:05:40.099> voltage<00:05:40.430> drops<00:05:40.970> or<00:05:41.270> voltage<00:05:41.720> issues<00:05:42.219> so<00:05:43.219> I

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
any voltage drops or voltage issues so I

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.570 
any voltage drops or voltage issues so I
was<00:05:44.780> looking<00:05:45.110> at<00:05:45.340> everything<00:05:46.340> with<00:05:46.520> a

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
was looking at everything with a

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.370 
was looking at everything with a
voltmeter<00:05:46.909> and<00:05:47.330> monitoring<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.169> Volt

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
voltmeter and monitoring the Volt

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.779 
voltmeter and monitoring the Volt
changes<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:50.440> turns<00:05:51.440> out<00:05:51.620> my<00:05:51.800> voltage<00:05:52.280> was

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
changes and turns out my voltage was

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.850 
changes and turns out my voltage was
dropping<00:05:53.240> while<00:05:53.510> the<00:05:54.050> car<00:05:54.229> was<00:05:54.260> on<00:05:54.669> and<00:05:55.669> so<00:05:56.090> um

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
dropping while the car was on and so um

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.990 
dropping while the car was on and so um
first<00:05:57.860> thing<00:05:58.039> I<00:05:58.099> did<00:05:58.280> was<00:05:58.370> check<00:05:58.430> my<00:05:58.669> battery

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
first thing I did was check my battery

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.080 
first thing I did was check my battery
and<00:05:59.650> what<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:00.740> previous<00:06:00.860> owner<00:06:01.250> did<00:06:01.520> what<00:06:01.729> my

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
and what the previous owner did what my

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.769 
and what the previous owner did what my
car<00:06:02.330> was<00:06:02.630> they<00:06:03.020> put<00:06:03.200> in<00:06:03.320> a<00:06:03.440> no-name<00:06:03.889> a<00:06:04.779> battery

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
car was they put in a no-name a battery

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.490 
car was they put in a no-name a battery
that<00:06:05.960> was<00:06:06.080> not<00:06:06.289> meant<00:06:06.500> for<00:06:06.590> this<00:06:06.770> car<00:06:07.029> so<00:06:08.080> I<00:06:09.080> had

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
that was not meant for this car so I had

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.370 
that was not meant for this car so I had
lower<00:06:09.710> amperage<00:06:10.159> and<00:06:10.630> it<00:06:11.630> just<00:06:12.229> couldn't

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
lower amperage and it just couldn't

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.399 
lower amperage and it just couldn't
support<00:06:12.800> all<00:06:13.039> the<00:06:13.310> cons<00:06:13.610> in<00:06:13.789> this<00:06:13.820> car<00:06:14.090> so<00:06:15.050> I

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409 
support all the cons in this car so I

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.089 
support all the cons in this car so I
got<00:06:15.710> an<00:06:15.889> interstate<00:06:16.520> AGM<00:06:17.450> battery<00:06:17.870> which<00:06:18.409> I'll

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
got an interstate AGM battery which I'll

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:36.670 
got an interstate AGM battery which I'll
show<00:06:19.370> you<00:06:33.370> interstate<00:06:34.370> battery<00:06:34.789> this<00:06:35.719> is<00:06:35.960> or<00:06:36.229> I

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
show you interstate battery this is or I

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.000 
show you interstate battery this is or I
think<00:06:37.070> these<00:06:37.130> are<00:06:39.460> hh8<00:06:40.460> batteries<00:06:40.940> so<00:06:42.010> usually

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
think these are hh8 batteries so usually

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.250 
think these are hh8 batteries so usually
for<00:06:43.460> these<00:06:43.610> as<00:06:43.820> classes<00:06:44.240> that<00:06:44.479> you<00:06:44.570> want<00:06:44.690> to<00:06:44.840> h8

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
for these as classes that you want to h8

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:54.959 
for these as classes that you want to h8
battery<00:06:45.590> the<00:06:45.770> big<00:06:46.010> ones<00:06:46.340> and<00:06:47.800> mine<00:06:48.800> puts<00:06:49.010> out

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:54.969 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:57.129

ac1000 cold cranking apps
oh<00:06:57.169> no<00:06:57.409> 1000<00:06:58.159> cranking<00:06:58.490> amps<00:06:58.760> and<00:07:00.700> it's<00:07:01.700> just

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:01.909 
oh no 1000 cranking amps and it's just

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:03.420 
oh no 1000 cranking amps and it's just
you<00:07:02.029> want<00:07:02.180> to<00:07:02.270> be<00:07:02.360> in<00:07:02.450> the<00:07:02.539> same<00:07:02.750> range<00:07:03.020> as<00:07:03.289> the

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
you want to be in the same range as the

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.909 
you want to be in the same range as the
original<00:07:04.430> battery<00:07:04.639> that<00:07:05.150> Mercedes<00:07:05.919> shipped

original battery that Mercedes shipped
with<00:07:07.130> these<00:07:07.250> cars<00:07:07.520> I'm<00:07:07.760> not<00:07:07.909> sure<00:07:08.029> what<00:07:08.180> the

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
with these cars I'm not sure what the

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.690 
with these cars I'm not sure what the
actual<00:07:08.750> specs<00:07:09.110> but<00:07:09.320> you<00:07:10.159> just<00:07:10.279> walk<00:07:10.430> in<00:07:10.460> that

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
actual specs but you just walk in that

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.310 
actual specs but you just walk in that
range<00:07:10.969> just<00:07:11.539> to<00:07:11.599> make<00:07:11.750> sure<00:07:11.870> you<00:07:11.990> have<00:07:12.139> enough

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
range just to make sure you have enough

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.920 
range just to make sure you have enough
amperage<00:07:12.560> and<00:07:13.070> power<00:07:13.460> to<00:07:13.669> go<00:07:13.930> power
