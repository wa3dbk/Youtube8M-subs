00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
I'm not sure he is as fully recognized

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.569 
I'm not sure he is as fully recognized
as<00:03:48.660> he<00:03:48.780> should<00:03:49.049> be<00:03:49.290> because<00:03:49.680> it's<00:03:50.220> not<00:03:50.430> only

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
as he should be because it's not only

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.789 
as he should be because it's not only
graffiti<00:03:51.329> that<00:03:51.690> he<00:03:51.900> he<00:03:53.060> influenced<00:03:54.410> but<00:03:55.410> hip

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
graffiti that he he influenced but hip

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.720 
graffiti that he he influenced but hip
heart<00:03:56.099> but<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.640> whole<00:03:56.910> kind<00:03:57.299> of<00:03:57.480> movement<00:03:58.730> is

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
heart but that whole kind of movement is

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.979 
heart but that whole kind of movement is
very<00:04:00.060> important<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:00.900> think<00:04:01.069> as<00:04:02.069> a<00:04:02.989> historical

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
very important I think as a historical

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.650
