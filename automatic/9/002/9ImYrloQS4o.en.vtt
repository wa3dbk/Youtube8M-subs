00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
a dump truck so you don't have to handle

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.439 
a dump truck so you don't have to handle
it<00:00:33.530> one<00:00:33.710> more<00:00:33.920> time

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
kind of guide the wood up oh it doesn't

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.630 
kind of guide the wood up oh it doesn't
fall<00:00:41.269> off<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.480> side<00:00:41.920> um<00:00:42.920> where<00:00:43.309> did<00:00:43.399> you<00:00:43.489> find

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
fall off the side um where did you find

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.639 
fall off the side um where did you find
the<00:00:43.760> conveyor<00:00:45.130> University<00:00:46.360> surplus<00:00:47.360> sale

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.540 

this<00:00:51.649> is<00:00:51.860> leftover<00:00:52.309> wiring<00:00:53.079> from<00:00:54.550> distant

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
this is leftover wiring from distant

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.889 
this is leftover wiring from distant
over<00:00:55.820> here<00:00:56.469> and<00:00:57.790> what<00:00:58.790> I<00:00:58.820> did<00:00:59.329> is<00:00:59.510> this<00:00:59.660> is<00:00:59.870> a

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
over here and what I did is this is a

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.700 
over here and what I did is this is a
208<00:01:00.640> three-phase<00:01:01.640> motor<00:01:01.969> I<00:01:02.559> wanted<00:01:03.559> to

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
208 three-phase motor I wanted to

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.040 
208 three-phase motor I wanted to
convert<00:01:04.369> it<00:01:04.550> to<00:01:05.140> 110<00:01:06.160> single-phase<00:01:07.899> so<00:01:08.899> I<00:01:08.960> took

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
convert it to 110 single-phase so I took

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.120 
convert it to 110 single-phase so I took
this<00:01:09.530> motor<00:01:09.800> off<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.240> gearbox<00:01:12.039> but<00:01:13.039> I've

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
this motor off of the gearbox but I've

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.870 
this motor off of the gearbox but I've
had<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.340> really<00:01:14.890> screwy<00:01:15.890> coupler<00:01:16.340> up<00:01:16.550> here<00:01:16.789> in

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
had a really screwy coupler up here in

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.770 
had a really screwy coupler up here in
the<00:01:17.000> gearbox<00:01:17.209> is<00:01:17.690> a<00:01:17.720> spline<00:01:18.649> shaft<00:01:19.600> so<00:01:20.600> what<00:01:20.750> I

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
the gearbox is a spline shaft so what I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.520 
the gearbox is a spline shaft so what I
ended<00:01:21.110> up<00:01:21.259> doing<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:22.190> this<00:01:22.399> motor<00:01:22.700> had<00:01:23.020> a<00:01:24.020> dual

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
ended up doing is this motor had a dual

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.910 
ended up doing is this motor had a dual
shaft<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.610> know<00:01:25.720> we<00:01:26.720> also<00:01:26.959> had<00:01:27.229> output<00:01:27.800> out

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
shaft you know we also had output out

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.779 
shaft you know we also had output out
this<00:01:28.160> mm-hmm

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
this mm-hmm

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.570 
this mm-hmm
so<00:01:29.270> what<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:29.509> did<00:01:29.569> is<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.929> put<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.410> shaft<00:01:31.039> coupling

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
so what I did is I put a shaft coupling

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.200 
so what I did is I put a shaft coupling
here

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.210 

and<00:01:35.330> what<00:01:36.260> I<00:01:36.290> did<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:36.710> added<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:39.160> 110<00:01:40.160> volt

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
and what I did is added the 110 volt

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.220 
and what I did is added the 110 volt
single-phase<00:01:41.090> motor<00:01:41.390> with<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.380> little<00:01:42.650> bracket

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
single-phase motor with a little bracket

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.630 
single-phase motor with a little bracket
so<00:01:45.230> now<00:01:45.410> what<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.680> does<00:01:45.830> is<00:01:46.010> just<00:01:46.220> basically

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
so now what it does is just basically

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.910 
so now what it does is just basically
drive<00:01:47.030> through<00:01:47.390> this<00:01:47.570> motor<00:01:47.960> which<00:01:48.470> is<00:01:48.650> dead

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
drive through this motor which is dead

00:01:48.920 --> 00:02:00.460 
drive through this motor which is dead
now<00:01:49.420> into<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.510> gearbox

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.530
