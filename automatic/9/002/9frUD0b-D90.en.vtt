00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
usually just hit select and think

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.860 
usually just hit select and think
they're<00:00:38.190> ready<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> go<00:00:38.660> they're<00:00:39.660> actually

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.560 
very important and let me show you why
here<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.829> Adam<00:00:44.670> Wainwright<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.329> I've

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
here you see Adam Wainwright and I've

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.389 
here you see Adam Wainwright and I've
never<00:00:45.870> actually<00:00:46.200> used<00:00:46.680> him<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.129> game<00:00:47.250> before

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399

sinker<00:00:55.350> look<00:00:55.710> at<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.190> mean<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.940> gonna

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
sinker look at that I mean it's gonna

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.520 
sinker look at that I mean it's gonna
break<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> little<00:00:57.629> bit<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:58.440> gonna

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
break a little bit so if you're gonna

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.990 
break a little bit so if you're gonna
throw<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.219> don't<00:00:59.399> want<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> try<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> keep

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
throw that you don't want to try to keep

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.930 
throw that you don't want to try to keep
it<00:01:00.149> pretty<00:01:00.600> low<00:01:01.190> in<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.489> strike<00:01:02.550> zone

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
to try to hit cutter missed on my timing

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.780 
to try to hit cutter missed on my timing
a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.270> bit<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:31.100> maybe<00:01:32.100> six<00:01:32.579> now

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
a little bit on that one maybe six now

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.390 
a little bit on that one maybe six now
his<00:01:32.909> cutter<00:01:33.439> doesn't<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> straight<00:01:35.189> four

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
his cutter doesn't have a straight four

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.850 
his cutter doesn't have a straight four
seam<00:01:35.579> fastball<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:37.409> also<00:01:37.650> while<00:01:37.770> you're

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
seam fastball and also while you're

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.990 
seam fastball and also while you're
doing<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> learn<00:01:38.640> all<00:01:38.820> their

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
doing this you get to learn all their

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.060 
doing this you get to learn all their
speeds<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.470> two<00:01:40.710> pictures<00:01:41.009> are

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
speeds so you know if two pictures are

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.440 
speeds so you know if two pictures are
gonna<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.340> coming<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:42.090> at<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> same

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
gonna be coming in really at the same

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.450 
gonna be coming in really at the same
speed

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.730 

for<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.670> more<00:01:47.940> I'll<00:01:48.810> see<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.080> we<00:01:49.140> throw<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.530> nice

best possible outcome we could hope from
that<00:03:05.760> scenario<00:03:06.410> let's<00:03:07.410> move<00:03:07.560> on<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.769> tip

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
that scenario let's move on to tip

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:16.270 
that scenario let's move on to tip
number<00:03:08.330> three<00:03:13.010> check<00:03:14.010> your<00:03:14.340> confidence<00:03:15.090> meter

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
strikes they get more confident so I

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:51.819 
strikes they get more confident so I

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.720 

sinker<00:03:52.829> confidence<00:03:53.190> went<00:03:53.340> up<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.430> little<00:03:53.579> bit

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
sinker confidence went up a little bit

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.820 
sinker confidence went up a little bit
alright<00:03:53.970> now<00:03:54.360> he's<00:03:54.510> got<00:03:54.720> almost<00:03:55.590> full

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.130 
take all these things into account your
pitching<00:04:08.580> can<00:04:08.819> just<00:04:08.970> become<00:04:09.239> extraordinarily

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
pitching can just become extraordinarily

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:18.370 
pitching can just become extraordinarily
much<00:04:10.980> better<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:12.870> moving<00:04:13.590> on<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.709> number<00:04:13.860> two
