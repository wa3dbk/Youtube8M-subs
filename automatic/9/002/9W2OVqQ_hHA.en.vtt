just like everything in the universe its
energy<00:04:01.849> right<00:04:02.060> but<00:04:02.780> she<00:04:02.989> had<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.200> belief<00:04:03.620> about

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
energy right but she had a belief about

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.790 
energy right but she had a belief about
