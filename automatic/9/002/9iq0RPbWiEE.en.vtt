00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
on and I think that I have developed a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.369 
on and I think that I have developed a
method<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.449> putting<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.899> duvet<00:01:01.140> cover

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
method for putting on the duvet cover

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.420 
method for putting on the duvet cover
that<00:01:01.590> doesn't<00:01:01.859> make<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.070> want<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.280> kill

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that doesn't make you want to kill

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.820 
that doesn't make you want to kill
yourself<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.420> am<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.229> tell<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.619> about
