I feel that ultimately they feel
respected<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.239> they<00:00:48.329> begin<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:50.480> believe<00:00:52.100> that

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
respected and they begin to believe that

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.580 
respected and they begin to believe that
they're<00:00:54.300> capable<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.289> people

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
they're capable of more because people

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.290 
they're capable of more because people
are<00:00:55.680> paying<00:00:55.860> attention<00:00:55.980> differently<00:00:59.149> one<00:01:00.149> of

such a way that I felt they had really

such a way that I felt they had really

their hard work is a student who came

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.320 
their hard work is a student who came
into<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> school<00:01:10.380> who<00:01:10.500> barely<00:01:11.130> spoke<00:01:11.520> for

into the school who barely spoke for

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.719 
into the school who barely spoke for
very<00:01:12.780> various<00:01:13.740> reasons<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.340> had<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> lot<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
very various reasons and had a lot of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.999 
very various reasons and had a lot of
difficulty<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.299> communication<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.140> that

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
difficulty with communication and that

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249 
difficulty with communication and that
student<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:17.820> sitting<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> student

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
student is now sitting on the student

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.469 
student is now sitting on the student
council<00:01:19.290> using<00:01:19.920> his<00:01:20.070> voice<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.909> represent<00:01:21.360> his

class

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.840 
class
it's<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.170> very<00:01:24.410> small<00:01:24.710> school<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:25.490> we're<00:01:25.670> able

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
it's a very small school so we're able

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.300 
it's a very small school so we're able
to<00:01:26.030> do<00:01:26.180> things<00:01:26.450> in<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:27.290> much<00:01:27.470> more<00:01:27.650> personal<00:01:27.890> way

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
to do things in a much more personal way

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.970 
to do things in a much more personal way
I<00:01:28.580> believe<00:01:29.180> that<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.900> reason<00:01:30.260> JC<00:01:30.470> FS<00:01:30.830> is

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
I believe that the reason JC FS is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.010 
I believe that the reason JC FS is
sewing<00:01:31.310> unique<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:31.910> because<00:01:32.330> of<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.720> level<00:01:32.990> of

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
sewing unique is because of the level of

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.450 
sewing unique is because of the level of
commitment<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.620> caring<00:01:34.010> that<00:01:34.070> goes<00:01:34.280> on<00:01:34.400> in

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
commitment and caring that goes on in

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.430 
commitment and caring that goes on in
the<00:01:34.670> agency<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.330> specifically<00:01:36.170> in<00:01:36.320> the

the agency and specifically in the
