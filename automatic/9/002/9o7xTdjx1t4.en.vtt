something that should be eaten straight
away<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:27.000> don't<00:02:27.210> cook<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.750> then<00:02:27.810> set

away so you don't cook it and then set

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.350 
away so you don't cook it and then set
it<00:02:28.500> aside<00:02:28.620> for<00:02:28.800> about<00:02:29.220> an<00:02:29.370> hour<00:02:29.490> two<00:02:29.820> hours<00:02:30.150> and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
it aside for about an hour two hours and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360 
it aside for about an hour two hours and
then<00:02:30.420> reheat<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.050> because<00:02:31.710> if<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.920> do<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.070> it

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
then reheat it because if you do that it

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.910 
then reheat it because if you do that it
will<00:02:32.430> release<00:02:32.760> its<00:02:32.970> water<00:02:33.470> only<00:02:34.470> cook<00:02:34.650> enough

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920

to finish in one meal

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.050 
to finish in one meal
but<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.620> thought<00:02:37.860> goes<00:02:38.100> really<00:02:38.400> well<00:02:38.550> with<00:02:38.730> this
