00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

I'm<00:00:00.120> making<00:00:00.480> a<00:00:00.570> tutorial<00:00:00.750> on<00:00:01.350> how<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.560> draw<00:00:01.829> a

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
I'm making a tutorial on how to draw a

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.709 
I'm making a tutorial on how to draw a
dumbbell<00:00:02.870> first<00:00:03.980> you<00:00:04.980> make<00:00:05.190> two<00:00:05.960> little<00:00:07.160> small

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
dumbbell first you make two little small

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:16.369 
dumbbell first you make two little small
circles<00:00:10.280> right<00:00:11.280> there<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:14.299> then<00:00:15.379> you

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
circles right there like that then you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.740 
circles right there like that then you
take<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> small<00:00:16.949> circles<00:00:17.369> make<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> smaller

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
take the small circles make a smaller

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.080 
take the small circles make a smaller
circle<00:00:19.199> inside<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.859> then<00:00:20.490> make<00:00:20.699> an<00:00:20.850> even

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
circle inside of it then make an even

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.000 
circle inside of it then make an even
smaller<00:00:21.330> circle<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.050> shade<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:25.010> there

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
smaller circle and shade it in there

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.130 
smaller circle and shade it in there
just<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.250> that

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
just like that

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.259 
just like that
so<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.289> should<00:00:28.410> look<00:00:28.740> like<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.060> so<00:00:30.060> far

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
so the I should look like that so far

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.630 
so the I should look like that so far
when<00:00:31.019> you're<00:00:31.170> done<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.279> make

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
when you're done with that you can make

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.630 
when you're done with that you can make
little<00:00:32.969> little<00:00:33.750> eyebrows<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:35.160> make<00:00:35.340> two

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
little little eyebrows and make two

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.889 
little little eyebrows and make two
lines<00:00:36.380> above<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.680> eyes<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> side

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
lines above the eyes like on the side

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.330 
lines above the eyes like on the side
just<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:44.070> could<00:00:44.190> put

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
just like that and then you could put

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.639 
just like that and then you could put
two<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.760> lines<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:46.079> kind<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.379> make<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
two little lines to kind of make the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.069 
two little lines to kind of make the
cheeks<00:00:47.070> under<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> eyes<00:00:49.070> just<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.340> that

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
cheeks under the eyes just like that

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.360 
cheeks under the eyes just like that
should<00:00:52.079> start<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> look<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.039> when

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
should start to look like that when

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:03.189 
should start to look like that when
you're<00:00:54.360> done<00:00:55.250> make<00:00:56.480> three<00:00:57.480> curved<00:00:58.440> lines<00:01:01.190> down

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
you're done make three curved lines down

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.520 
you're done make three curved lines down
like<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.790> when<00:01:05.790> you're<00:01:05.909> done<00:01:06.030> doing<00:01:06.210> that

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
like that when you're done doing that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.080 
like that when you're done doing that
make<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:08.479> like<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:10.369> make<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> same<00:01:11.820> thing

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
make this like that make the same thing

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.289 
make this like that make the same thing
over<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.659> side<00:01:12.770> like<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:15.090> when

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
over on this side like that but when

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.899 
over on this side like that but when
you're<00:01:15.479> done<00:01:17.150> they<00:01:18.150> could<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.909> then

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
you're done they could go like that then

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.230 
you're done they could go like that then
with<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.390> one<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.950> could<00:01:23.100> go<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.820> so

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
with this one you could go like that so

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.010 
with this one you could go like that so
that<00:01:24.990> should<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.409> his<00:01:25.710> little<00:01:26.009> trunk<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:27.900> when

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020

you're<00:01:28.140> done<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:29.460> take<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:32.090> go

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you're done with that you take this go

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.499 
you're done with that you take this go
like<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.920> take<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.130> other<00:01:35.159> side<00:01:35.520> go<00:01:36.270> like

like that take the other side go like

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.960 
like that take the other side go like
that<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.960> same<00:01:37.200> way<00:01:37.549> when<00:01:38.549> you're<00:01:38.700> done<00:01:38.850> with

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
that go up like that make a little head

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.230 
that go up like that make a little head
and<00:01:45.210> put<00:01:45.479> little<00:01:46.200> hair<00:01:46.590> right<00:01:46.619> there<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:48.210> a

and put little hair right there make a
few<00:01:48.509> little<00:01:48.659> lines<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.490> make<00:01:50.610> his

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
few little lines like that to make his

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.380 
few little lines like that to make his
little<00:01:50.939> hairs<00:01:52.430> when<00:01:53.430> you're<00:01:53.579> done<00:01:53.729> with<00:01:54.180> his

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
little hairs when you're done with his

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.780 
little hairs when you're done with his
little<00:01:54.600> hairs<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.159> his<00:01:56.340> ears

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
little hairs you can just make his ears

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.209 
little hairs you can just make his ears
and<00:01:57.240> they're<00:01:57.540> kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> really<00:01:59.360> big

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
and they're kind of like a really big

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:08.080 
and they're kind of like a really big
butterfly<00:02:02.219> wing<00:02:02.719> on<00:02:03.719> each<00:02:04.049> side<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.590> his<00:02:04.829> head

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.510 

just<00:02:09.739> like<00:02:10.739> that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
just like that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.170 
just like that
then<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:13.170> take<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.739> butterfly<00:02:14.190> wing<00:02:14.430> and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
then you take the butterfly wing and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.820 
then you take the butterfly wing and
make<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> little<00:02:15.540> line<00:02:15.840> there<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.410> end<00:02:16.620> it

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
make a little line there and end it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.890 
make a little line there and end it
right<00:02:17.130> there<00:02:17.190> like<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.750> same<00:02:19.019> thing

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
right there like that the same thing

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.949 
right there like that the same thing
like<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:23.040> that's<00:02:23.220> how<00:02:23.519> his<00:02:24.180> head<00:02:24.660> will

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
like that so that's how his head will

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.339 
like that so that's how his head will
look<00:02:26.239> when<00:02:27.239> you're<00:02:27.390> done<00:02:27.540> with<00:02:27.720> his<00:02:27.900> head<00:02:28.140> you

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
look when you're done with his head you

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.220 
look when you're done with his head you
could<00:02:28.530> start<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.890> make<00:02:29.040> his<00:02:29.250> body<00:02:29.780> like<00:02:30.780> by

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
could start to make his body like by

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.330 
could start to make his body like by
doraid<00:02:31.440> making<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> line<00:02:32.580> down<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.180> way

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
doraid making the line down this way

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:42.880 
doraid making the line down this way
then<00:02:35.959> making<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:38.510> little<00:02:39.920> circle<00:02:40.920> right<00:02:40.950> there

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
then making a little circle right there

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.809 
then making a little circle right there
and<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:45.200> out<00:02:46.200> like<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.670> do<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> same

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
and going out like that do the same

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.800 
and going out like that do the same
thing<00:02:48.239> on<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.450> other<00:02:48.480> side<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:49.230> lot<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.830> that

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
thing on the other side a lot like that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.210 
thing on the other side a lot like that
make<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> little<00:02:52.230> circle<00:02:52.890> go<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:54.030> so

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
make a little circle go like that so

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.210 
make a little circle go like that so
then<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:57.060> can<00:02:57.239> make<00:02:57.390> his<00:02:57.540> little<00:02:57.810> toes<00:02:58.220> by
