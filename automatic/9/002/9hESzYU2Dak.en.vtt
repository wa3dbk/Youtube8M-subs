00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:11.120
 do you dream my hello and heartily 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.190
 welcome to check for viking metal 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.049
 fans had actually moment again 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.580
 there are already videos for this game 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.380
 but these are retrospective of me 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.449
 the quality of the presentation is not so 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.810
 as I would like them now 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.910
 Almost a year and 125 more videos 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.710
 later now a second try now 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.869
 but enough of the words and right into the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.000
 almost always happen in wide balls 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.130
 you play the big viking warrior 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.570
 Karin actually fell in the bay 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.680
 he becomes his favorite goddess 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.940
 freya saved and back on the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.430
 thrown back battlefield 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.050
 because a dark threat away 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.940
 and that would have the hollywood film of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.160
 13th warrior reminds the threatened 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.539
 viking world and you are practically the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.489
 only hope for improvement 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.110
 so get on with a sharp one 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.149
 shut one and one brutal 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.680
 fighting ax in another hand and fighting 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.969
 against gray and today this country 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.980
 measured and the hard but 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.469
 inferior will now begin life 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.780
 difficult to make so brutal is already 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.000
 a pretty good catchword for your ax 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.439
 rams their almost the opponent in the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.420
 keep the screen from becoming authentic 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.340
 is would be the real balancing would be 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.070
 Floats other liquids 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.240
 and if it fly like a surcharge 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.439
 they 're just arming me with something 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.630
 which through as in so many others 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.220
 combat-oriented action adventures but 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.990
 middle and she in as if that were 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.750
 warrior or the body of the opponent 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.909
 actually an obstacle to water yes 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.229
 actually, ultimately, that is for the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.479
 atmosphere in the fight is a whole 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.740
 big plus point and as if that were 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.670
 You do not have enough beyond that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.619
 still the possibility to one 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 devastating finishing move even at 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.939
 the screen whole body parts in front of the opponent 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.530
 disconnects or settles in two 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.960
 halves to share even more 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.369
 in slow motion this finishing move is 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.649
 although optional leads to that 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.880
 opponent instead of a three small ones 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.770
 red ball can 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.719
 You can also do those red wise ones 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.420
 then collect an additional strip leads to 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.220
 a kind of divine mum or a rage 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.869
 bar and if the associated 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.729
 skill does not strengthen you 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.960
 only yours but also all kites 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.429
 Beijing in the moment with you 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.039
 fighting together on the battlefield 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.210
 with fire ice or additional damage 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.799
 through electricity 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.090
 we can already do that 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.649
 Highlight of the game after you 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.840
 enough viking from the clutches of the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.550
 gray liberated you attack the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.380
 respective fortress of evil 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.400
 Here you are not alone 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.170
 instead, get the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.970
 Support from all Vikings 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.340
 you have freed up to this time 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.930
 This creates an incredible mass 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.209
 sleep with hundreds of vikings and 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.099
 Hundreds of opponents I in doubt 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.970
 could just tear in the air 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.130
 or 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.049
 you just with mass over pensions 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.480
 would if they could but because since the 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.090
 viking ami with you and around you 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.349
 your task as hero is the viking 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.910
 important in such a situation 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.769
 personalities like shamans or 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.810
 to turn off the main head of the enemy 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.250
 you have to get close to these 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.019
 you but only once side by 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.000
 page with your Vikings by Horden 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.650
 of opponents appreciate if you however 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.420
 the important opponents are starting 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.980
 the real spectacle especially 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.079
 main people are blackboard creature with 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.549
 the devastating influence the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.079
 we can nutter you properly 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.010
 not in the decisive moment 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.590
 dodge 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.269
 in connection then comes at the whole 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.280
 big opponents always a quick time 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.690
 event at least the right keys 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.579
 push and if the brave china 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.730
 done because he is having an extremely 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.859
 brutal killing frequency block actually 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.079
 I'm not a big fan of quicktime 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.150
 events but actually you are in vienna 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.959
 at the vsk less bad than in 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.609
 other titles 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.290
 reason is that you in the 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.450
 decisive moment practically karin 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.700
 sword his help it with brutal 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.750
 Violence downright into an opponent 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.549
 to press 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.799
 One swords the field of an opponent 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.450
 It's hard work together and you are 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.609
 effectively involved demian 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.100
 fast beat follow on your corner 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.350
 mouse button hammett with the mouse is that 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.849
 entire fight so pick yet 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.620
 more beautiful than with the gamepad since that 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.860
 presses with index and middle finger 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.990
 the mouse at least 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.730
 a better impression for the fighting 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.110
 mediated and basically acts as 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.300
 if you are actually for it 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.020
 be responsible that the pressure on 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.400
 The weapon comes with the click of the button 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.230
 on the gamepad, in fact, the case 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.450
 that would be quite subjective 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.430
 would be with me the case anyway 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.630
 I recommend the whole thing once with mouse 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.090
 and keyboard to try out 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.280
 Otherwise, if you have in the Belfast 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.180
 no buttons but gamepad buttons 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.190
 are displayed 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.320
 the problem is probably because that one 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.940
 Gamepad in the computer is the game 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.070
 that does not matter in the case 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.490
 especially if you like it with mouse and 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.160
 keyboard used but always dazzles 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.440
 the gamepad buttons provided it is in 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.060
 some way that thinks 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.790
 There is a gamepad for use 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.010
 could be added that the game you 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.690
 an open game world promises something 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.520
 however, on closer inspection not 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.320
 can completely fulfill there though 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.090
 basically the possibility wild around 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.070
 to break and sometimes you can 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.260
 which wikingerdorf choose now nothing 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.310
 exempt 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.900
 In principle , however , followed one 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.700
 stringent course of events with 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.410
 other words we have to village first 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.919
 liberate an object there 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.690
 hold 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.560
 then you will be free in Wietendorf 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.680
 making and in the connection because he comes 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.320
 in the first place to the occasion 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.880
 experience c or village visit because 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.820
 you play under one before 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.390
 pretext to access there first 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.100
 blocked 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.690
 In addition to that, I am the fundamental one 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.669
 actually always repeat the game system 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.100
 The freed village visited special 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.780
 cities and fights every amount of gray 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.940
 vikings as well you can not 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.100
 equipment suitable for us attributes 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.630
 Values ​​you can only insofar 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.210
 improve that her his life points 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.280
 can increase his life ball 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.630
 the reason that it still does not 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.970
 on 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.090
 it is similar that the game itself 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.190
 practically constantly with or in yourself 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.600
 superlative expanded in this video 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.700
 Do you see some fights? 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.500
 However, these are nothing in comparison 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.540
 with the downright huge battles 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.950
 in the course of the game to beat about it 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.720
 It also teaches a whole series 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.550
 interesting skills the particular ones 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.200
 Situations can be useful and 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.860
 make it easier for you if you play it 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.740
 uses 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.990
 but basically you have too 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.450
 the possibility with one say 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.970
 basic portfolio of skills and the 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.550
 Dodge ability of scary relative 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.810
 to get through the game well 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.550
 Overall, because the Belfast has 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.870
 but a solid title with very good 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.460
 combat system and the euro by 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.020
 evaluation steam required when the game 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.480
 again by 75 percent cheaper 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.580
 is offered is an alternative 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.140
 maybe the wacky bluetooth that 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.160
 but no convincing fight 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.750
 system just like the battle vs 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.280
 the fighting system and the mass battles 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.130
 it is also the action adventure 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.380
 distinguishes the history and also the 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.230
 Graphic presentation are rough and 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.670
 edged the whole world in yourselves 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.190
 after the installation finds again 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.840
 you should be wise in the wise further 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.640
 have questions then write this on 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.040
 best in a comment below that 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.750
 youtube video to those of 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.980
 one of the first videos come thanks 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.740
 that you made the extra click 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.390
 has on you and in others the 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.200
 have looked here now thank you very much 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.090
 for watching 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.400
 but before you leave, I still have 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.750
 a little question what is yours at one 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.730
 action-adventure most importantly 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.230
 fighting system or additional gameplay 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.560
 mechanics such as 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.520
 jump passages or the 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.960
 background story the story of 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.600
 game would interest me if 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.880
 Let me tell you 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.360
 but a commentary there would me 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.830
 looking forward 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.750
 at the occasion you can too 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.610
 Like to subscribe to the channel that would 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.830
 I am also very happy 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.430
 But now I am again 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:29.630
 that's why it's good 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:29.630
 and goodbye faithful 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.140
