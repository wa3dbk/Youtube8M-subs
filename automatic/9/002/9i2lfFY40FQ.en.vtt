00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
you could undo some of the buttons and

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.390 
you could undo some of the buttons and
tie<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:16.880> up<00:04:17.120> like<00:04:17.420> a<00:04:17.650> heron<00:04:18.650> that's<00:04:19.040> really

tie it up like a heron that's really
cute<00:04:19.579> option<00:04:20.030> or<00:04:20.480> you<00:04:20.750> can<00:04:20.930> do<00:04:21.079> them<00:04:21.230> back<00:04:21.440> up

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
and just leave it hanging I tried

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.650 
and just leave it hanging I tried
tucking<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.860> in<00:04:25.010> but<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.700> really<00:04:26.030> wasn't<00:04:26.210> my

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
tucking it in but that really wasn't my

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.870 
tucking it in but that really wasn't my
style<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:27.260> these<00:04:27.950> are<00:04:28.130> probably<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.730> only

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
style so these are probably the only

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.910 
style so these are probably the only
ways<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.570> i'll<00:04:29.660> end<00:04:29.810> up<00:04:29.930> wearing<00:04:30.200> it<00:04:30.380> but<00:04:30.650> i

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
ways that i'll end up wearing it but i

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.860

even though it's a bold print the colors
are<00:06:52.229> neutral<00:06:52.680> enough<00:06:52.889> so<00:06:53.100> that<00:06:53.130> you<00:06:53.340> can

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460
