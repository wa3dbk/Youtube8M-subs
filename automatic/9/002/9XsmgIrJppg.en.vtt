00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.020
 Good morning! 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.220
 Marta 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.120
 Luke 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.260
 and our latest offer 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.060
 fireplace insert cast iron FRANEK 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.420
 Cast iron always reminds me of the classics 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.680
 and I would like to admit that this contribution surprised me a lot 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.580
 tinted glass GLASS 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740
 modern discreet door handle 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.520
 I'm guessing that technological solutions will also surprise me 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.660
 you're right 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.360
 traditional form 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.020
 hides innovative solutions 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.020
 but first let's pay attention to what is immediately apparent 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.900
 that is its mass 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.560
 This is 240 kg 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.720
 here is a lot 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.920
 and yet a very delicate front 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.600
 with the rest of both the glass and the front 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.560
 they give the greatest possible vision of fire in this cartridge 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.160
 additionally, it is worth paying attention to the movable flue with the possibility of adjustment up to 360 degrees 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.060
 enables easy installation of pipes 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.840
 You focused on the front 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.640
 and I was interested in the bulge that is in the back 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.440
 Is it needed? 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.320
 Yes, this is the second rear wall in the cartridge 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.380
 is responsible for the ventilation of the combustion chamber 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.380
 and as we are already in the air, it's worth saying a few words about the outlet itself 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.340
 it is standard in the cartridge underneath 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.400
 thanks to this 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.420
 the air goes to both the grid and the back wall 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.700
 to the furnace chamber 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.200
 whereas all these advantages are taken into account and the fact that we are dealing with a closed combustion chamber 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.360
 this cartridge fits perfectly with intelligent homes 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.780
 and for homes with recuperators 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.000
 Please pay attention to the slides 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.560
 I guess they are used to regulate the air 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.640
 Yes 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.700
 the first of them is responsible for regulating the air supply, which goes to the grate 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:04.160
 the second one is responsible for the air that goes through the system of holes on the back wall to the furnace chamber 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.320
 thanks to this we get very low emission of substances to the environment 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.580
 is this also a shift? what is it for? 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.240
 you have a very good eye 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.540
 it is the air curtain responsible for the clean glass system 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.380
 you mentioned about the issue 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.500
 can we say that FRANEK is an environmentally friendly product 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.200
 Yes of course 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.420
 thanks to the aforementioned afterburning system 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.520
 it is characterized by very low pollen emission 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.780
 Additionally 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.220
 it meets the announced European standards 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.200
 and has a certificate? 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.460
 FRANEK combines the tradition of cast iron inserts with the latest technical solutions 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.060
 FRANEK will surprise us once more 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.800
 we will have the opportunity to watch it in various scenes 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.300
 and additionally optionally with an acumotte liner 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600
 Thank you for watching the movie! 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.780
