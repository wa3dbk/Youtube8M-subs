or whatever so what they need to do is

00:00:49.570 --> 00:01:05.320 
or whatever so what they need to do is
just<00:00:50.080> hold<00:00:50.470> hands<00:00:50.770> spread<00:00:51.190> apart<00:00:51.489> like<00:00:51.699> this

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.300 

it's<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.140> variation<00:01:06.620> because<00:01:06.920> they<00:01:07.070> are<00:01:07.130> still

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.400 

I<00:01:19.640> always<00:01:20.640> love<00:01:20.940> this<00:01:21.120> idea<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.660> am<00:01:21.900> trying<00:01:22.230> it

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
I always love this idea I am trying it

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.410 
I always love this idea I am trying it
every<00:01:22.740> time<00:01:22.980> one<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.670> greatest<00:01:23.700> I've<00:01:24.210> done

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
every time one of the greatest I've done

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.790 
every time one of the greatest I've done
was<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.130> street<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:27.440> went<00:01:28.440> over

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
was actually on a street that went over

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.550 
was actually on a street that went over
a<00:01:28.830> hill<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> asked<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.660> couple<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.230> be<00:01:31.350> on

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
a hill so I asked the couple to be on

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.960 
a hill so I asked the couple to be on
the<00:01:31.740> top<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.190> hill<00:01:32.370> so<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.580> can<00:01:32.700> actually

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the top of the hill so you can actually

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.420 
the top of the hill so you can actually
see<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.600> ocean<00:01:34.050> behind<00:01:37.100> absolutely<00:01:38.100> loved<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
see the ocean behind absolutely loved it

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.150 
see the ocean behind absolutely loved it

a<00:02:39.620> wedding<00:02:39.950> photographer<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.670> was<00:02:40.940> looking<00:02:41.330> up

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
a wedding photographer I was looking up

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
to other photographers doing that and I

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.280 
to other photographers doing that and I
always<00:02:43.460> wondered<00:02:43.880> how<00:02:44.120> do<00:02:44.180> they<00:02:44.510> do<00:02:44.570> it<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:45.050> just

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
always wondered how do they do it I just

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.320 
always wondered how do they do it I just
had<00:02:45.770> one<00:02:45.980> lens<00:02:46.280> at<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.580> time<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:46.970> was<00:02:47.120> just

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
had one lens at that time I was just

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.140 
had one lens at that time I was just
training<00:02:47.540> 24<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.260> 70<00:02:48.620> not<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.520> best<00:02:49.700> lens<00:02:49.940> I

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
training 24 to 70 not the best lens I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.510 
training 24 to 70 not the best lens I
would<00:02:50.600> suggest<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:51.080> telephoto<00:02:51.980> lens<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.370> you

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
would suggest a telephoto lens and you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.640 
would suggest a telephoto lens and you
can<00:02:52.700> shoot<00:02:52.820> from<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.090> distance<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.720> I'm<00:02:54.380> always

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
can shoot from a distance so I'm always

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.280 
can shoot from a distance so I'm always
looking<00:02:55.010> for<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.430> hedge<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.060> if<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.080> see<00:02:57.260> a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
looking for the hedge and if I see a

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.350 
looking for the hedge and if I see a
hedge<00:02:57.530> there's<00:02:58.010> no<00:02:58.250> way<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.460> will<00:02:58.670> miss<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.150> so

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
hedge there's no way I will miss it so

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.630

it took me a while to figure out how to
make<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.630> green<00:03:19.870> greener<00:03:20.260> if<00:03:20.650> you're<00:03:21.010> a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
make the green greener if you're a

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.190 
make the green greener if you're a
beginner<00:03:21.520> you<00:03:21.700> don't<00:03:22.030> really<00:03:22.180> know<00:03:22.450> how<00:03:22.990> it's

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
beginner you don't really know how it's

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.610 
beginner you don't really know how it's
done

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620

I can tell you it's very simple increase

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.100 
I can tell you it's very simple increase
the<00:03:26.170> vibrancy<00:03:26.770> in<00:03:26.950> in<00:03:27.730> Lightroom<00:03:28.209> not<00:03:28.990> in

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
the vibrancy in in Lightroom not in

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.290 
the vibrancy in in Lightroom not in
Photoshop<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.770> tried<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.459> in<00:03:30.640> Photoshop<00:03:31.090> it's

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
Photoshop I tried that in Photoshop it's

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.120 
Photoshop I tried that in Photoshop it's
not<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.690> same<00:03:31.900> thing<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.350> this<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.770> one<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:32.950> the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
not the same thing so this is one of the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.370 
not the same thing so this is one of the
reasons<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.550> chose<00:03:33.640> Lightroom<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.900> Photoshop

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
reasons I chose Lightroom of a Photoshop

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.010 
reasons I chose Lightroom of a Photoshop
just<00:03:35.560> for<00:03:36.220> this<00:03:36.370> picture<00:03:36.790> because<00:03:37.600> Lightroom

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
just for this picture because Lightroom

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.930 
just for this picture because Lightroom
gives<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.500> better<00:03:38.709> vibrance<00:03:39.250> at<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.580> green<00:03:39.819> is

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
gives a better vibrance at the green is

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.940 
gives a better vibrance at the green is
greener<00:03:40.209> if<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.930> don't<00:03:41.200> find<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.530> hedge<00:03:41.739> I'll

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
greener if I don't find the hedge I'll

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.140 
greener if I don't find the hedge I'll
definitely<00:03:42.819> find<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.180> fence<00:03:46.620> or<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:48.150> textured
