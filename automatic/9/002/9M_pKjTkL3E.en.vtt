00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 yes i have a part we and chains 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.099
 I've been to their form 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.170
 yes i don't really know jos 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.320
 why tenth and we ask our work 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.130
 especially why that is important because 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.130
 self 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.430
 This is actually what we have to focus on 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.920
 were chain 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.990
 actually comes from the French god is true 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.920
 actually a long necklace they have ' 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.740
 they have between 1880 and 1910 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.440
 were actually worn like that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.540
 further away with a brother standing with 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 a small watch or something similar 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.770
 so actually won that continued 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.930
 we see that does not want to wear that long 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 being yes that is until beyond 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.629
 you will look at all the photos 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.610
 are you going to see it looks great but there 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.989
 have no marks on it and that is whole 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.870
 often the case 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.820
 with this kind of old you know today what i am 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.559
 would suggest that we have a moment 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.609
 test if it's gold 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.280
 ok so what do a little matter of it 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.930
 actually set up the piece here and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.270
 you really sit back because small 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 dashes we go we do we go 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.979
 actually with that sur just about that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.990
 rub a line as in the end 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.509
 it sur metal 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.280
 going to solve means that it is none 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.229
 18 carats can be 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.700
 he had a bearing has been removed or 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.270
 metal 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.340
 and what you see you know it yourself 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.990
 you can see that it stays a line below 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.460
 that with turning on 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.820
 so that finally means it 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.150
 18 carat gold yes something important is that 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.750
 we are going to look a lot of understanding 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.960
 a large my ribs and then you see 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.909
 actually we have 24 a good 24 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.180
 and the had and then they tellson 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.450
 mental calculating dog the 500 550 euros 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.650
 gold and I suspect if you sell it 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.250
 that year 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.030
 between 6 and 900 euros 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.960
 being able 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.960
 but the weather is nice 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.509
 yeah i think i'm on the right now 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.180
 might wear me right 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.590
 occasionally at fifty occasions way 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.590
 as an everyday necklace
