these are noted number one on the inside
there's<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.530> small<00:02:01.890> label<00:02:02.280> which<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.549> hard<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
there's a small label which is hard to

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.609 
there's a small label which is hard to
make<00:02:02.969> out<00:02:03.119> right<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.350> are<00:02:04.380> also

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
make out right there but they are also

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.310 
make out right there but they are also
noted<00:02:05.219> as<00:02:05.399> well<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.750> headphones

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
noted as well on the headphones

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.949 
noted as well on the headphones
themselves<00:02:07.670> now<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.970> first<00:02:09.270> glance<00:02:09.629> when<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
themselves now at first glance when I

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.510 
themselves now at first glance when I
first<00:02:10.229> pulled<00:02:10.560> these<00:02:10.739> out<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.160> thought<00:02:11.370> they

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
first pulled these out I thought they

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.800 
first pulled these out I thought they
might<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.700> broken<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.840> earcups<00:02:13.319> kind<00:02:13.590> of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
might be broken the earcups kind of

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.170 
might be broken the earcups kind of
move<00:02:13.989> around<00:02:14.290> almost<00:02:14.920> like<00:02:15.130> on<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> bearing<00:02:16.000> if

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
move around almost like on a bearing if

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.150 
move around almost like on a bearing if
you<00:02:16.330> will<00:02:16.510> they're<00:02:17.080> very<00:02:17.260> flexible<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.069> they

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
you will they're very flexible and they

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.920 
you will they're very flexible and they
move<00:02:18.340> around<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.730> lot<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.300> again<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.720> thought

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
move around a lot and again I thought

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.260 
move around a lot and again I thought
they<00:02:20.050> might<00:02:20.170> be<00:02:20.319> damaged<00:02:20.860> but<00:02:21.160> after<00:02:22.060> using

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
they might be damaged but after using

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.940 
they might be damaged but after using
them<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.720> determined<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.590> actually

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
them I determined that this is actually

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.860 
them I determined that this is actually
how<00:02:24.069> they're<00:02:24.220> supposed<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.580> be<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.540> does

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
how they're supposed to be and this does

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.900 
how they're supposed to be and this does
result<00:02:26.319> in<00:02:26.560> some<00:02:26.800> really<00:02:27.280> comfortable

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
result in some really comfortable

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.050 
result in some really comfortable
earphones<00:02:28.810> they<00:02:29.440> essentially<00:02:30.340> mold<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.000> your

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
ear almost like exactly to the shape of

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.250 
ear almost like exactly to the shape of
your<00:02:33.880> ear<00:02:34.150> because<00:02:34.330> they're<00:02:34.690> able<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.110> move

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
your ear because they're able to move

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.020 
your ear because they're able to move
around<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.860> much<00:02:36.040> they're<00:02:36.580> almost<00:02:36.760> like

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
around so much they're almost like

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.080 
around so much they're almost like

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
well so let's talk about the sound these

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.170 
well so let's talk about the sound these
do<00:02:56.170> offer<00:02:56.410> some<00:02:56.620> really<00:02:57.160> good<00:02:57.340> passive<00:02:57.940> noise

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
do offer some really good passive noise

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.330 
do offer some really good passive noise
isolation<00:02:58.900> because<00:02:59.200> as<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.590> mentioned<00:02:59.980> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
isolation because as I mentioned the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.920 
isolation because as I mentioned the
earcups<00:03:00.760> themselves<00:03:01.269> are<00:03:01.360> quite<00:03:01.569> large<00:03:01.810> so

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
earcups themselves are quite large so

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.020 
earcups themselves are quite large so
they<00:03:02.140> fit<00:03:02.380> over<00:03:02.769> your<00:03:02.799> ear<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.310> block<00:03:03.849> out

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
they fit over your ear and block out

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.570 
they fit over your ear and block out
most<00:03:04.299> sound<00:03:04.780> for<00:03:05.380> forty<00:03:05.709> dollars<00:03:06.099> they<00:03:06.310> sound

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
most sound for forty dollars they sound

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.000 
most sound for forty dollars they sound
about<00:03:06.849> as<00:03:06.910> I'd<00:03:07.330> expect<00:03:07.780> them<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.110> sound<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.620> did

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
about as I'd expect them to sound I did

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.400 
about as I'd expect them to sound I did
kind<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.340> hear<00:03:09.519> some<00:03:09.989> crackling<00:03:10.989> for<00:03:11.290> lack<00:03:11.380> of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
kind of hear some crackling for lack of

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.780 
kind of hear some crackling for lack of
a<00:03:11.590> better<00:03:11.620> word<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:12.250> some<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.610> higher

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
a better word and some of the higher

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.370 
a better word and some of the higher
notes<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.510> music<00:03:13.780> i<00:03:13.870> was<00:03:13.989> listening<00:03:14.049> to

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
notes and the music i was listening to

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.800 
notes and the music i was listening to
but<00:03:15.010> they<00:03:15.130> do<00:03:15.190> offer<00:03:15.459> good<00:03:15.849> base<00:03:16.180> as<00:03:16.510> well

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
but they do offer good base as well

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.680 
but they do offer good base as well
which<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.440> again<00:03:18.250> as<00:03:18.430> expected<00:03:18.880> for<00:03:19.239> a<00:03:19.299> forty

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
which is again as expected for a forty

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.660 
which is again as expected for a forty
dollar<00:03:19.720> set<00:03:20.170> of<00:03:20.320> headphones<00:03:20.739> so<00:03:21.280> no<00:03:21.489> these

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
dollar set of headphones so no these

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.520
