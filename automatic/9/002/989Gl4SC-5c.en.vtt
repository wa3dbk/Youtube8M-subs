that<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.699> Willy<00:01:00.030> Wonka<00:01:00.390> meme<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
that and it's the Willy Wonka meme and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.369 
that and it's the Willy Wonka meme and
so<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:02.879> obviously<00:01:03.329> referring<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.960> golden

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
so it's obviously referring to golden

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.410 
so it's obviously referring to golden
tickets<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.390> in<00:01:06.770> previous<00:01:07.770> games<00:01:08.420> what

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.140 
tickets and in previous games what
golden<00:01:09.810> tickets<00:01:10.229> allowed<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.070> was<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
golden tickets allowed you to do was you

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.210 
golden tickets allowed you to do was you
could<00:01:12.540> um<00:01:12.750> choose<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> player<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
could um choose a player so you have to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.999 
could um choose a player so you have to
choose<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.390> player<00:01:18.689> as<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.350> baseline<00:01:19.799> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
choose a player as your baseline and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.760 
choose a player as your baseline and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
then from there you can modify their

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.359 
then from there you can modify their
attributes<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:25.229> has<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> card

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
attributes so it has to be like a card

in<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> game<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.720> player<00:01:27.960> can't<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.380> retired

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
in the game the player can't be retired

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.609 
in the game the player can't be retired
you<00:01:29.909> can't<00:01:30.150> give<00:01:30.329> them<00:01:30.600> an<00:01:30.869> individual

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you can't give them an individual
