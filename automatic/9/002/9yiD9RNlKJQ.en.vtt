I'm very dyslexic so when I did a levels

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.050

I<00:01:30.540> did<00:01:30.900> stuff<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.979> enjoyed<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.729> could<00:01:32.880> do

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I did stuff that I enjoyed or could do

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
I did stuff that I enjoyed or could do
so<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> did<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:34.290> level<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.070> art<00:01:35.250> without<00:01:35.700> history

advanced G mvq in art and design what

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.980 
advanced G mvq in art and design what
that<00:01:43.710> meant<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.190> I<00:01:44.670> could<00:01:45.240> spend<00:01:45.509> my

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that meant is that I could spend my

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.740 
that meant is that I could spend my
entire<00:01:46.080> days<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:47.159> two<00:01:47.610> years<00:01:47.940> painting<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
entire days for two years painting and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.779 
entire days for two years painting and
drawing<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.259> sticking<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.950> acting<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
drawing and sticking and acting and

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.999 
drawing and sticking and acting and
improvising<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.200> had<00:01:52.380> thought<00:01:52.680> about

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
improvising and I had thought about

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.730 
improvising and I had thought about
being<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.850> fine<00:01:54.090> artist<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:54.899> again<00:01:55.200> that's<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
being a fine artist but again that's a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.880 
being a fine artist but again that's a
very<00:01:56.009> sort<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.610> risky<00:01:57.240> path<00:01:57.929> so<00:01:58.229> an<00:01:58.380> animators

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
very sort of risky path so an animators

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.889 
very sort of risky path so an animators
seemed<00:01:59.220> like<00:01:59.460> slightly<00:02:00.000> more<00:02:00.149> stable<00:02:00.390> option

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
seemed like slightly more stable option

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.899 
seemed like slightly more stable option
somewhere<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.319> middle<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:02.640> work<00:02:02.759> in

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
somewhere in the middle to work in

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.469 
somewhere in the middle to work in
animation

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
animation

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.259 
animation
I<00:02:03.690> think<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.950> typical<00:02:05.280> image<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:07.470> little

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
I think the typical image is a little

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.930 
I think the typical image is a little
bearded<00:02:09.269> pale<00:02:09.569> skinned<00:02:09.929> men<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.790> think<00:02:11.790> that's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
bearded pale skinned men I think that's

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.490 
bearded pale skinned men I think that's
changing<00:02:12.060> quite<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> lot<00:02:13.080> with<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.350> technology

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
changing quite a lot with the technology

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.860 
changing quite a lot with the technology
that's<00:02:13.980> coming<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.459> because<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.910> can<00:02:15.150> come

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
that's coming in because you can come

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.449 
that's coming in because you can come
from<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.140> much<00:02:16.319> more<00:02:16.500> creative<00:02:16.769> base<00:02:17.190> rather

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
from a much more creative base rather

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.070 
from a much more creative base rather
than<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.819> technology<00:02:18.330> base<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:19.940> think<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.239> lot<00:02:22.049> of

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
be either really really creative or you

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.440 
be either really really creative or you

in the whole pipeline of animation

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.180 
in the whole pipeline of animation
there's<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.510> whole<00:02:57.810> sort<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.709> breadth<00:02:59.010> of

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
there's a whole sort of breadth of

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.449 
characters we've got got in the office
which<00:03:01.620> makes<00:03:01.829> it<00:03:01.950> really<00:03:01.980> sort<00:03:02.400> of

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
which makes it really sort of

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.680 
which makes it really sort of
interesting<00:03:02.840> day-to-day<00:03:03.840> work<00:03:04.049> environment

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.370 

I<00:03:12.270> don't<00:03:13.270> think<00:03:13.450> there's<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.780> right<00:03:14.110> or<00:03:14.170> wrong

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
I don't think there's a right or wrong

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.810 
I don't think there's a right or wrong
way<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.710> getting<00:03:14.980> your<00:03:15.130> portfolio<00:03:15.790> or

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
way of getting your portfolio or

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.140 
way of getting your portfolio or
showreel<00:03:16.390> seen<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:17.710> always<00:03:18.670> suggest<00:03:18.820> different

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
showreel seen I always suggest different

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.450 
showreel seen I always suggest different
ways<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.630> people<00:03:20.050> but<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.680> know<00:03:21.070> I<00:03:21.100> will<00:03:21.340> say

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
ways to people but you know I will say

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.130 
ways to people but you know I will say
all<00:03:21.580> we<00:03:21.670> know<00:03:21.820> don't<00:03:21.970> give<00:03:22.180> up<00:03:22.330> be<00:03:22.540> persistent

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
all we know don't give up be persistent

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.050 
all we know don't give up be persistent
but<00:03:23.320> then<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.590> equally<00:03:24.100> get<00:03:24.280> frustrated<00:03:24.880> by<00:03:25.000> the

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
but then I equally get frustrated by the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.120 
but then I equally get frustrated by the
same<00:03:25.300> person<00:03:25.540> phoneme<00:03:25.960> every<00:03:26.200> day<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.800> don't

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
same person phoneme every day so I don't

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.440 
same person phoneme every day so I don't
think<00:03:27.370> there's<00:03:27.490> a<00:03:27.550> right<00:03:27.700> or<00:03:27.760> wrong<00:03:27.880> way<00:03:28.180> but<00:03:28.420> I

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
think there's a right or wrong way but I

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.750 
think there's a right or wrong way but I
think<00:03:28.540> there<00:03:28.870> are<00:03:28.900> really<00:03:29.890> nice<00:03:30.190> sort<00:03:30.700> of

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
think there are really nice sort of

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.270 
think there are really nice sort of
creative<00:03:31.300> ways<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.780> can<00:03:31.960> you<00:03:32.260> can<00:03:32.470> do<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.830> for

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
creative ways you can you can do it for

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.850 
creative ways you can you can do it for
example<00:03:33.550> we<00:03:33.790> had<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.910> girl<00:03:34.210> who<00:03:34.840> made<00:03:35.530> a

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
example we had a girl who made a

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.940

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.720 
herself in the middle of it and she made
a<00:03:41.740> box<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.490> it<00:03:43.330> was<00:03:43.510> called<00:03:44.010> where<00:03:45.010> Alex<00:03:45.430> fits

people become shareholders when they've

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.500 
people become shareholders when they've
been<00:05:10.810> here<00:05:11.160> long<00:05:12.160> enough<00:05:12.190> so<00:05:12.610> we<00:05:12.820> try<00:05:13.390> and<00:05:13.419> make

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
been here long enough so we try and make

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.900 
been here long enough so we try and make
it<00:05:13.630> feel<00:05:13.870> like<00:05:13.900> a<00:05:14.050> creative<00:05:14.650> team<00:05:15.070> rather<00:05:15.640> than

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
it feel like a creative team rather than

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.219 
it feel like a creative team rather than
people<00:05:16.120> are<00:05:16.510> just<00:05:16.630> sort<00:05:16.780> of<00:05:16.870> pigeon-holed

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
people are just sort of pigeon-holed

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.140 
people are just sort of pigeon-holed
into<00:05:17.590> their

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
into their

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.690 
into their
comping<00:05:18.720> or<00:05:18.900> tracking<00:05:19.230> or<00:05:19.590> lighting<00:05:20.070> and<00:05:20.280> we

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
comping or tracking or lighting and we

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.100 
comping or tracking or lighting and we
don't<00:05:20.880> believe<00:05:21.030> in<00:05:21.180> things<00:05:21.450> like<00:05:21.570> runners

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
don't believe in things like runners

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.850 
don't believe in things like runners
because<00:05:22.560> we<00:05:23.370> often<00:05:24.060> see<00:05:24.440> runners<00:05:25.440> around<00:05:25.740> the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
because we often see runners around the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.620 
because we often see runners around the
industry<00:05:26.070> just<00:05:26.430> fetching<00:05:26.640> cups<00:05:27.030> of<00:05:27.210> tea<00:05:27.420> or

industry just fetching cups of tea or

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.390 
industry just fetching cups of tea or
stuff<00:05:27.990> like<00:05:28.020> that<00:05:28.110> and<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.410> don't<00:05:28.740> get<00:05:29.250> the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
stuff like that and I don't get the

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.220 
stuff like that and I don't get the
benefit<00:05:29.760> of<00:05:29.790> that<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:30.060> if<00:05:30.120> people<00:05:30.270> come<00:05:31.020> to

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
benefit of that so if people come to

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.170 
benefit of that so if people come to
work<00:05:31.410> even<00:05:31.980> if<00:05:32.040> a<00:05:32.100> very<00:05:32.400> start<00:05:32.730> level<00:05:33.030> they'll

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
work even if a very start level they'll

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.210 
work even if a very start level they'll
be<00:05:33.300> doing<00:05:33.480> a<00:05:33.720> genuine<00:05:34.440> job<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:34.860> getting<00:05:35.040> time

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
be doing a genuine job and getting time

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.070 
be doing a genuine job and getting time
on<00:05:35.430> equipment<00:05:35.730> if<00:05:36.300> you<00:05:36.480> really<00:05:36.900> really

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
on equipment if you really really

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.300 
on equipment if you really really
implicitly<00:05:37.620> trust<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:38.040> people<00:05:38.160> you're

implicitly trust the people you're
working<00:05:38.550> with<00:05:39.350> then<00:05:40.350> it<00:05:40.470> doesn't<00:05:40.740> matter

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
working with then it doesn't matter

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.010 
working with then it doesn't matter
whether<00:05:41.160> you<00:05:41.640> get<00:05:41.880> outvoted<00:05:42.060> at<00:05:42.570> meetings
