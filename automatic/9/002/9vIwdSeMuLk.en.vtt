00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.670 

right<00:00:04.700> so<00:00:04.910> next<00:00:05.090> day<00:00:05.420> we're<00:00:05.660> onto<00:00:05.870> his<00:00:06.350> Rhino

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
right so next day we're onto his Rhino

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.910 
right so next day we're onto his Rhino
mode<00:00:07.040> now<00:00:07.279> which<00:00:08.090> i<00:00:08.540> think<00:00:09.050> is<00:00:09.469> quite<00:00:09.679> nice

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
mode now which i think is quite nice

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.620 
mode now which i think is quite nice
they<00:00:10.250> have<00:00:10.490> remoulded<00:00:11.059> the<00:00:11.150> head<00:00:11.360> perfectly

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
they have remoulded the head perfectly

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.770 
they have remoulded the head perfectly
so<00:00:12.260> is<00:00:12.580> different<00:00:13.580> and<00:00:13.730> it<00:00:14.000> does<00:00:14.210> fit<00:00:14.480> in<00:00:14.600> well

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
so is different and it does fit in well

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.599 
so is different and it does fit in well
and<00:00:15.019> got<00:00:15.410> this<00:00:15.590> nice<00:00:15.769> little<00:00:16.010> horn<00:00:16.279> to<00:00:16.430> it<00:00:16.519> as

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
and got this nice little horn to it as

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.640 
and got this nice little horn to it as
well<00:00:16.640> which<00:00:16.939> falls<00:00:17.630> away<00:00:17.779> like<00:00:18.080> that<00:00:18.109> that's

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
well which falls away like that that's

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.140 
well which falls away like that that's
how<00:00:18.800> it<00:00:18.890> stores<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:21.520> apart<00:00:22.520> from<00:00:22.610> the<00:00:22.940> head

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
how it stores and apart from the head

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.029 
how it stores and apart from the head
there's<00:00:23.720> no<00:00:24.199> difference<00:00:24.710> really<00:00:24.800> between

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
there's no difference really between

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.269 
there's no difference really between
this<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:26.150> puma<00:00:27.080> or<00:00:27.260> winged<00:00:27.710> wolf<00:00:28.039> or

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
this and the puma or winged wolf or

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.240 
this and the puma or winged wolf or
whatever<00:00:28.760> you<00:00:29.029> want<00:00:29.240> to<00:00:29.300> call<00:00:29.510> it<00:00:29.920> but<00:00:30.920> again

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
whatever you want to call it but again

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.639 
whatever you want to call it but again
lots<00:00:31.910> of<00:00:32.059> nice<00:00:32.239> colors<00:00:32.689> all<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.019> colors<00:00:33.440> use

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
lots of nice colors all the colors use

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.479 
lots of nice colors all the colors use
perfectly<00:00:34.219> here<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:35.269> i<00:00:36.070> really<00:00:37.070> like<00:00:37.280> it<00:00:37.460> i

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
perfectly here and i really like it i

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.080 
perfectly here and i really like it i
don't<00:00:38.120> have<00:00:38.360> six<00:00:38.720> shot<00:00:39.309> but<00:00:40.309> i<00:00:40.550> can<00:00:40.910> imagine

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
don't have six shot but i can imagine

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.830 
don't have six shot but i can imagine
that<00:00:41.360> this<00:00:41.870> Rhino<00:00:42.200> mode<00:00:42.500> is<00:00:42.739> a<00:00:43.070> lot<00:00:43.600> better<00:00:44.600> to

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
that this Rhino mode is a lot better to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.020 
that this Rhino mode is a lot better to
look<00:00:44.989> at<00:00:45.170> then<00:00:45.850> then<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.030> puma<00:00:47.390> or<00:00:47.420> wolf<00:00:48.079> and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
look at then then the puma or wolf and

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.740 
look at then then the puma or wolf and
apparently<00:00:50.030> there's<00:00:50.270> supposed<00:00:50.480> to<00:00:50.570> be<00:00:50.660> a

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
apparently there's supposed to be a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.350 
apparently there's supposed to be a
winged<00:00:51.050> wolf<00:00:51.829> mode<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:52.579> i<00:00:52.610> assume<00:00:53.090> there's<00:00:53.300> a

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
winged wolf mode so i assume there's a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.020 
winged wolf mode so i assume there's a
winged<00:00:53.600> Rhino<00:00:54.410> mode<00:00:54.770> as<00:00:54.950> well<00:00:54.980> but<00:00:55.430> I'm<00:00:55.969> not

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
winged Rhino mode as well but I'm not

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.670 
winged Rhino mode as well but I'm not
going<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.570> try<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:56.780> fill<00:00:57.020> around<00:00:57.289> with<00:00:57.530> it

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
going to try and fill around with it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.190 
going to try and fill around with it
because<00:00:57.800> he<00:00:58.010> was<00:00:58.280> an<00:00:58.430> expensive<00:00:58.910> figure<00:00:59.239> very

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
because he was an expensive figure very

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.380 
because he was an expensive figure very
nice<00:01:00.440> though<00:01:00.680> I<00:01:00.860> will<00:01:01.100> do<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.309> detail<00:01:01.789> hot<00:01:02.360> on

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
nice though I will do a detail hot on

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.050 
nice though I will do a detail hot on
this<00:01:02.690> bit<00:01:02.989> unlike<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.339> good<00:01:04.519> mode

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.130 

again<00:01:08.060> not<00:01:08.329> really<00:01:08.659> sure<00:01:08.810> what<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.109> say

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
again not really sure what to say

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.749 
again not really sure what to say
because<00:01:09.439> I<00:01:09.770> want<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.039> get<00:01:10.159> through<00:01:10.310> as<00:01:10.490> much<00:01:10.700> of

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
because I want to get through as much of

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.669 
because I want to get through as much of
these<00:01:11.030> modes<00:01:11.299> without<00:01:11.960> making<00:01:12.380> too<00:01:12.409> many

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
these modes without making too many

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.160 
these modes without making too many
parts<00:01:13.130> of<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.250> video<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.149> I'll<00:01:14.420> move<00:01:14.689> on<00:01:14.899> to

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
parts of the video so I'll move on to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.919 
parts of the video so I'll move on to
his<00:01:15.319> his<00:01:16.219> robot<00:01:16.609> mode<00:01:16.640> yeah<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.299> think<00:01:17.420> that's

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
his his robot mode yeah I think that's

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:19.510 
his his robot mode yeah I think that's
all<00:01:18.109> of<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.350> Michon<00:01:18.649> saw<00:01:18.859> move<00:01:19.100> on<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.429> his

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
all of the Michon saw move on to his

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.899 
all of the Michon saw move on to his
final<00:01:19.729> mode<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.810> I'll<00:01:21.079> see<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.640> okay<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:22.729> I

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
final mode and I'll see you okay so I

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.520 
final mode and I'll see you okay so I
explained<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.329> you<00:01:23.539> why<00:01:23.780> I'm<00:01:24.049> not<00:01:24.200> doing<00:01:24.439> the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
explained to you why I'm not doing the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.590 
explained to you why I'm not doing the
gun<00:01:24.709> mode<00:01:24.890> I<00:01:25.130> did<00:01:25.490> try<00:01:25.700> three<00:01:26.090> or<00:01:26.179> four<00:01:26.360> times

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
gun mode I did try three or four times

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.080 
gun mode I did try three or four times
to<00:01:26.840> do<00:01:26.990> it<00:01:27.140> but<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.860> never<00:01:28.369> turned<00:01:28.880> out<00:01:29.030> right

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
to do it but it never turned out right

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.419 
to do it but it never turned out right
so<00:01:30.049> I<00:01:30.079> just<00:01:30.350> moving<00:01:30.679> straight<00:01:30.890> onto<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.250> Rhino

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
so I just moving straight onto the Rhino

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.080 
so I just moving straight onto the Rhino
mode<00:01:31.759> which<00:01:32.539> you<00:01:33.020> know<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.429> it's<00:01:34.429> a<00:01:34.579> very<00:01:34.850> good

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
mode which you know is it's a very good

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.410 
mode which you know is it's a very good
modern<00:01:35.329> its<00:01:35.659> own<00:01:35.840> rights<00:01:36.109> um<00:01:36.909> just<00:01:37.909> look<00:01:38.270> at

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
modern its own rights um just look at

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.800 
modern its own rights um just look at
the<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.929> remoulded<00:01:39.530> head<00:01:39.739> with<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.099> nice

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
the the remoulded head with this nice

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.870 
the the remoulded head with this nice
chromed<00:01:41.810> horn<00:01:42.380> here<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.099> just<00:01:43.280> turn<00:01:43.459> around<00:01:43.610> a

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
chromed horn here and just turn around a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.359 
chromed horn here and just turn around a
bit<00:01:45.849> this<00:01:46.849> bit<00:01:46.909> you<00:01:47.719> know<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:48.110> shame<00:01:48.679> but<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.250> is

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
bit this bit you know a shame but it is

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.219 
bit this bit you know a shame but it is
necessary<00:01:49.880> let's<00:01:50.450> turn<00:01:50.689> them<00:01:50.750> towards<00:01:50.959> the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
necessary let's turn them towards the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.319 
necessary let's turn them towards the
light<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.439> bit<00:01:51.709> more<00:01:51.890> no<00:01:52.520> no<00:01:52.819> that's<00:01:52.969> the<00:01:53.149> best

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
light a bit more no no that's the best

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.940 
light a bit more no no that's the best
you<00:01:53.420> can<00:01:53.539> see<00:01:53.750> actually<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.590> can<00:01:54.739> see<00:01:54.920> a

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
you can see actually you can see a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.589 
you can see actually you can see a
little<00:01:55.099> bit<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.399> indentation<00:01:56.149> there<00:01:56.329> on<00:01:56.479> the

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
little bit of indentation there on the

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.619 
little bit of indentation there on the
chrome<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.280> yeah<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:58.549> bit<00:01:58.819> and<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.329> bit<00:01:59.509> on

00:01:59.619 --> 00:01:59.629 
chrome and yeah this bit and the bit on

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:01.270 
chrome and yeah this bit and the bit on
the<00:01:59.719> other<00:01:59.869> side<00:02:00.079> are<00:02:00.289> necessary<00:02:00.950> because<00:02:01.099> it

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
the other side are necessary because it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.969 
the other side are necessary because it
is<00:02:01.489> on<00:02:01.789> this<00:02:02.119> joint<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.259> flips<00:02:03.530> back<00:02:03.770> like

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
is on this joint so it flips back like

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.240 
is on this joint so it flips back like
that<00:02:04.189> for<00:02:04.700> when<00:02:04.819> he<00:02:04.909> transforms<00:02:05.270> back<00:02:06.219> so<00:02:07.219> that

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
that for when he transforms back so that

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.020 
that for when he transforms back so that
has<00:02:07.549> to<00:02:07.700> be<00:02:07.729> there<00:02:08.000> unfortunately<00:02:08.299> and<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:10.190> is

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
has to be there unfortunately and it is

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.640 
has to be there unfortunately and it is
difficult<00:02:11.359> to<00:02:11.690> see<00:02:11.959> because<00:02:12.139> of<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.470> light

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
difficult to see because of the light

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.800 
difficult to see because of the light
and<00:02:12.799> the<00:02:12.859> way<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.280> this<00:02:13.430> guy<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:14.420> shaped

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and the way that this guy is is shaped

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.599 
and the way that this guy is is shaped
with<00:02:15.109> this<00:02:15.290> big<00:02:15.500> shoulder<00:02:15.889> otherwise<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.220> dark

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:16.609 
with this big shoulder otherwise I dark

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.940 
with this big shoulder otherwise I dark
and<00:02:16.790> more<00:02:16.970> towards<00:02:17.329> like<00:02:17.569> but<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.590> does<00:02:18.739> have

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
and more towards like but it does have

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.930 
and more towards like but it does have
right<00:02:19.430> here<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.940> little<00:02:20.420> triangle<00:02:21.940> indentation

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
right here a little triangle indentation

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.280 
right here a little triangle indentation
with<00:02:23.090> little<00:02:23.359> lines<00:02:23.569> drawn<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.049> it<00:02:24.170> as<00:02:24.260> well

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
with little lines drawn in it as well

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.430 
with little lines drawn in it as well
and<00:02:24.680> little<00:02:24.920> lines<00:02:25.099> above<00:02:25.639> the<00:02:26.000> head<00:02:26.150> there

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
and little lines above the head there

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.430 
and little lines above the head there
again<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:28.459> fit<00:02:28.730> around<00:02:28.940> here<00:02:29.599> round<00:02:30.109> the<00:02:30.260> top

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
again this fit around here round the top

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.099 
again this fit around here round the top
is<00:02:30.650> pulled<00:02:31.130> out<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.340> little<00:02:31.609> bit<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:32.090> give<00:02:32.329> an

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
is pulled out a little bit to give an

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.259 
is pulled out a little bit to give an
eyebrow<00:02:33.590> effect<00:02:33.950> as<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.220> eyes<00:02:34.459> pushed<00:02:34.880> in<00:02:35.120> to

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
eyebrow effect as the eyes pushed in to

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.650 
eyebrow effect as the eyes pushed in to
give<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.810> deep<00:02:36.230> looking<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.859> a<00:02:37.180> nice<00:02:38.180> curved

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
give it a deep looking I a nice curved

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.530 
give it a deep looking I a nice curved
kind<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.680> weird<00:02:40.130> mouth<00:02:40.430> for<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.910> rhino<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.419> know

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
kind of weird mouth for a rhino you know

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.870 
kind of weird mouth for a rhino you know
it's<00:02:41.690> very<00:02:41.840> pointy<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:43.280> does<00:02:43.549> work

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
it's very pointy but it does work

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.300 
it's very pointy but it does work
because<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.299> makes<00:02:44.419> it<00:02:44.599> look<00:02:44.720> more<00:02:44.750> robotic

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
because it makes it look more robotic

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.580 
because it makes it look more robotic
and<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.609> bit<00:02:46.849> it<00:02:47.180> would<00:02:47.660> be<00:02:47.870> nice<00:02:48.079> if<00:02:48.109> it

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
and this bit it would be nice if it

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.930 
and this bit it would be nice if it
could<00:02:48.739> have<00:02:49.099> moved<00:02:49.609> but<00:02:50.260> because<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.500> horn

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
could have moved but because of the horn

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.849 
could have moved but because of the horn
you<00:02:52.940> know<00:02:53.090> fair<00:02:53.450> enough<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.470> can't<00:02:54.680> have

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
you know fair enough and you can't have

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.069 
you know fair enough and you can't have
everything<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.579> would<00:02:56.419> just<00:02:56.599> have<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.750> closer

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
everything I would just have a closer

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.260 
everything I would just have a closer
look<00:02:57.440> at<00:02:57.590> it

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
look at it

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.820 
look at it
from<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.930> couple<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.260> sides<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:01.620> yeah<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.800> does

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
from a couple of sides and yeah it does

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.760 
from a couple of sides and yeah it does
work<00:03:03.280> very<00:03:03.310> well<00:03:03.610> as<00:03:03.910> screw<00:03:04.300> on<00:03:04.450> outside<00:03:04.810> there

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
work very well as screw on outside there

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.920 
work very well as screw on outside there
is<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.430> know<00:03:06.460> not<00:03:06.820> very<00:03:06.850> impressive<00:03:07.390> but<00:03:07.540> fair

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
is you know not very impressive but fair

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.790 
is you know not very impressive but fair
enough<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:09.190> we'll<00:03:09.370> pull<00:03:09.640> them<00:03:09.760> back<00:03:10.180> oh<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:11.380> said

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
enough so we'll pull them back oh I said

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.290 
enough so we'll pull them back oh I said
that<00:03:11.950> describe<00:03:12.340> these<00:03:12.490> bits<00:03:12.760> these<00:03:12.970> bits<00:03:13.210> here

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
that describe these bits these bits here

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.110 
that describe these bits these bits here
obviously<00:03:13.630> are<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.740> three<00:03:14.980> toes<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.880> his<00:03:16.180> feet

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
obviously are the three toes to his feet

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.340 
obviously are the three toes to his feet
which<00:03:19.120> again<00:03:19.270> is<00:03:19.420> fair<00:03:19.840> enough<00:03:20.080> you<00:03:20.230> know

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
which again is fair enough you know

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.200 
which again is fair enough you know
can't<00:03:20.770> get<00:03:20.920> rid<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:21.130> them<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.520> will<00:03:21.700> refocus

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
can't get rid of them and will refocus

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.320 
can't get rid of them and will refocus
here

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.360 

there<00:03:26.900> we<00:03:26.960> go<00:03:27.080> ah

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.140 

excuse<00:03:31.060> me<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:32.680> is<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:33.190> little<00:03:33.489> bit<00:03:33.670> tricky<00:03:34.120> to

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
excuse me it is a little bit tricky to

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.500 
excuse me it is a little bit tricky to
position<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.870> feet<00:03:35.019> so<00:03:35.200> he<00:03:35.290> does<00:03:35.879> stand<00:03:36.879> right

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
position the feet so he does stand right

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.170 
position the feet so he does stand right
here<00:03:38.069> as<00:03:39.069> you<00:03:39.190> can<00:03:39.340> see<00:03:39.519> there's<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.760> little<00:03:39.790> gap

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
here as you can see there's a little gap

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.600 
here as you can see there's a little gap
where<00:03:40.959> he<00:03:41.110> is<00:03:41.260> on<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.530> table<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.069> there<00:03:42.459> are

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
where he is on the table and there are

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.250 
where he is on the table and there are
his<00:03:42.760> feet<00:03:43.120> but<00:03:43.510> i'll<00:03:43.629> talk<00:03:43.810> about<00:03:43.840> them<00:03:44.080> in

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
his feet but i'll talk about them in

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.539 
his feet but i'll talk about them in
robot<00:03:44.680> mode<00:03:44.709> because<00:03:44.980> it's<00:03:45.190> going<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.400> be<00:03:45.519> a

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
robot mode because it's going to be a

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.880 
robot mode because it's going to be a
lot<00:03:45.700> easier<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:46.120> show<00:03:46.299> you<00:03:46.330> in<00:03:46.510> robot<00:03:46.810> mode

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
lot easier to show you in robot mode

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.740 
lot easier to show you in robot mode
yeah<00:03:47.890> very<00:03:48.610> impressive<00:03:48.909> around<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.569> front

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
yeah very impressive around the front

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.369 
yeah very impressive around the front
here<00:03:50.079> very<00:03:50.590> big<00:03:51.090> very<00:03:52.090> imposing<00:03:52.480> but<00:03:52.959> around

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
here very big very imposing but around

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.210 
here very big very imposing but around
the<00:03:53.560> back<00:03:54.150> is<00:03:55.150> not<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.510> lot<00:03:55.780> there<00:03:56.049> really<00:03:56.500> you

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
the back is not a lot there really you

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.190 
the back is not a lot there really you
get<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.519> legs<00:03:57.790> which<00:03:58.239> are<00:03:58.390> quite<00:03:58.599> small<00:03:58.750> and

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
get the legs which are quite small and

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.350 
get the legs which are quite small and
you<00:03:59.980> know<00:04:00.129> it's<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.459> bit<00:04:00.610> flimsy<00:04:01.060> round<00:04:01.239> the

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
you know it's a bit flimsy round the

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.569 
you know it's a bit flimsy round the
back<00:04:01.510> in<00:04:01.720> comparison<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:02.650> huge<00:04:02.980> massive

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
back in comparison to this huge massive

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.319 
back in comparison to this huge massive
front<00:04:03.870> portion<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.140> guy<00:04:05.319> that<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.010> get<00:04:06.329> so

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
front portion of the guy that you get so

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.680 
front portion of the guy that you get so
yeah<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.840> again<00:04:08.410> another<00:04:08.950> good<00:04:09.310> mode<00:04:09.690> all

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
yeah and again another good mode all

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.660 
yeah and again another good mode all
that<00:04:11.079> all<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.500> this<00:04:11.620> guy's<00:04:11.890> modes<00:04:12.190> are<00:04:12.370> good<00:04:12.549> to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
that all of this guy's modes are good to

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.759 
that all of this guy's modes are good to
be<00:04:12.700> honest<00:04:13.030> but<00:04:13.269> you<00:04:13.690> do<00:04:13.840> have<00:04:14.049> to<00:04:14.500> find

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
be honest but you do have to find

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.949 
be honest but you do have to find
problems<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.519> problems<00:04:15.819> for<00:04:16.359> this<00:04:16.479> mode<00:04:16.720> of

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
problems and problems for this mode of

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.009 
problems and problems for this mode of
the<00:04:17.799> legs<00:04:18.039> at<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.370> back<00:04:18.549> I<00:04:18.760> suppose<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.840> we'll

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
the legs at the back I suppose so we'll

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.200 
the legs at the back I suppose so we'll
move<00:04:20.169> on<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.470> his<00:04:20.620> final<00:04:20.829> mode<00:04:21.160> next<00:04:21.699> and<00:04:21.910> I'll

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
move on to his final mode next and I'll

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.840 
move on to his final mode next and I'll
see<00:04:22.419> right<00:04:23.110> so<00:04:23.320> we<00:04:23.470> finally<00:04:23.770> move<00:04:24.100> on<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.639> his

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
see right so we finally move on to his

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.740 
see right so we finally move on to his
robot<00:04:25.330> mode<00:04:25.360> now<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.280> he<00:04:27.280> is<00:04:27.490> really<00:04:28.270> really

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
robot mode now and he is really really

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.590 
robot mode now and he is really really
big<00:04:29.110> he's<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.919> really<00:04:30.760> massive<00:04:31.120> bigger

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
big he's a really massive bigger

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.170 
big he's a really massive bigger
unfortunately<00:04:32.590> just<00:04:32.919> like<00:04:33.190> six<00:04:33.520> shot<00:04:33.729> he<00:04:33.970> is

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
unfortunately just like six shot he is

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.750 
unfortunately just like six shot he is
pretty<00:04:34.479> much<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:35.050> brick<00:04:35.340> you're<00:04:36.340> not<00:04:36.520> going<00:04:36.700> to

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
pretty much a brick you're not going to

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.810 
pretty much a brick you're not going to
be<00:04:36.849> able<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:37.210> pose<00:04:37.419> this<00:04:37.660> guy<00:04:37.919> his<00:04:38.919> arms<00:04:39.490> do

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
be able to pose this guy his arms do

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.640 
be able to pose this guy his arms do
move<00:04:39.849> forward<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:40.750> do<00:04:40.960> move<00:04:41.200> all<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.560> way

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
move forward and do move all the way

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.310 
move forward and do move all the way
around<00:04:41.770> but<00:04:42.130> in<00:04:42.250> robot<00:04:42.610> mode<00:04:42.930> these<00:04:43.930> winged

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
around but in robot mode these winged

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.400 
around but in robot mode these winged
parts<00:04:45.060> injuries<00:04:46.060> movement<00:04:46.570> so<00:04:47.020> if<00:04:47.139> you<00:04:47.260> did

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
parts injuries movement so if you did

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.110 
parts injuries movement so if you did
want<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.710> move<00:04:47.800> them<00:04:48.039> all<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.639> way<00:04:48.729> around<00:04:48.849> you

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
want to move them all the way around you

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.839 
want to move them all the way around you
need<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.479> you<00:04:50.320> know<00:04:50.500> do<00:04:50.710> that<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:51.400> even<00:04:51.669> then

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
need to you know do that and even then

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.900 
need to you know do that and even then
the<00:04:52.630> gun<00:04:52.810> part<00:04:53.139> gets<00:04:53.919> kind<00:04:54.280> of<00:04:54.370> cool<00:04:54.580> on<00:04:54.789> the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
the gun part gets kind of cool on the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.020 
the gun part gets kind of cool on the
back<00:04:55.060> is<00:04:55.270> need

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
back is need

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.360 
back is need
but<00:04:58.030> you<00:04:58.150> get<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.330> idea<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:59.830> can't<00:05:00.070> move<00:05:00.250> a

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
but you get the idea you can't move a

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.720 
but you get the idea you can't move a
lot<00:05:00.520> his<00:05:01.000> knees<00:05:01.270> do<00:05:01.660> bend<00:05:01.930> as<00:05:02.140> well<00:05:02.670> but<00:05:03.670> that

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
lot his knees do bend as well but that

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.830 
lot his knees do bend as well but that
again<00:05:03.970> is<00:05:04.240> for<00:05:04.660> transformation<00:05:05.290> purposes

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
again is for transformation purposes

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.390 
again is for transformation purposes
it's<00:05:07.840> not<00:05:07.960> a<00:05:08.020> good<00:05:08.170> idea<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.650> try<00:05:08.890> it<00:05:08.950> just<00:05:09.100> in

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
it's not a good idea to try it just in

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.270 
it's not a good idea to try it just in
case<00:05:09.840> his<00:05:10.840> head<00:05:11.140> as<00:05:11.320> you<00:05:11.380> can<00:05:11.680> see<00:05:11.830> has<00:05:12.040> been

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
case his head as you can see has been

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.070 
case his head as you can see has been
remoulded<00:05:12.850> and<00:05:13.060> have<00:05:13.510> been<00:05:13.690> given<00:05:13.960> these

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
remoulded and have been given these

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.960 
remoulded and have been given these
their<00:05:14.320> little<00:05:14.590> homes<00:05:14.740> which<00:05:15.250> are<00:05:15.490> nice<00:05:15.700> little

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
their little homes which are nice little

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.010 
their little homes which are nice little
detail<00:05:16.980> things<00:05:17.980> to<00:05:18.580> add<00:05:18.730> on<00:05:18.940> which<00:05:19.420> fold<00:05:19.900> away

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
detail things to add on which fold away

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.680 
detail things to add on which fold away
nicely<00:05:20.380> into<00:05:21.190> his<00:05:21.310> head<00:05:21.520> like<00:05:21.820> that<00:05:22.000> when<00:05:22.540> you

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
nicely into his head like that when you

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.210 
nicely into his head like that when you
flip<00:05:23.170> them<00:05:23.320> out<00:05:23.440> again<00:05:23.590> for<00:05:23.950> when<00:05:24.070> he's

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
flip them out again for when he's

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.020 
flip them out again for when he's
transformed<00:05:25.920> there<00:05:26.920> we<00:05:27.040> go<00:05:27.130> all<00:05:27.730> together

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
transformed there we go all together

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.930 
transformed there we go all together
this<00:05:31.030> robot<00:05:31.630> mode<00:05:31.810> again<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.610> right<00:05:33.610> near<00:05:33.790> the

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
this robot mode again is right near the

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.530 
this robot mode again is right near the
top<00:05:34.180> it's<00:05:34.420> not<00:05:34.570> my<00:05:34.810> actually<00:05:35.620> no<00:05:35.850> no<00:05:36.850> it<00:05:37.150> is<00:05:37.300> the

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
top it's not my actually no no it is the

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.820 
top it's not my actually no no it is the
best<00:05:37.720> mode<00:05:37.990> for<00:05:38.290> him<00:05:38.410> because<00:05:38.500> it<00:05:38.680> brings

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
best mode for him because it brings

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.100 
best mode for him because it brings
everything<00:05:39.700> together<00:05:40.030> it<00:05:40.390> brings<00:05:40.510> the<00:05:40.720> red<00:05:40.960> it
