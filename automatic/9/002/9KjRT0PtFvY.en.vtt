that's bordering on on sort of nuclei I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.500 
that's bordering on on sort of nuclei I

think in those situations Donner has

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.380 
think in those situations Donner has
taught<00:02:19.780> me<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:20.400> lot<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.520> patience<00:02:22.030> i'm<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.180> bit<00:02:22.300> of

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
reassess and I guess you know that's

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.500 
reassess and I guess you know that's
thing<00:02:30.550> with<00:02:30.700> having<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.060> child<00:02:31.300> with<00:02:31.360> special

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
on what are realistic goals and and

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.210 
on what are realistic goals and and
learn<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.750> lot<00:02:40.960> of<00:02:41.110> patients<00:02:41.710> through<00:02:42.010> that

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
learn a lot of patients through that

during my pregnancy I didn't have
testing<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.430> think<00:02:46.390> many<00:02:46.810> people<00:02:47.140> today<00:02:47.200> like

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
testing I think many people today like

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.970 
testing I think many people today like
to<00:02:48.490> be<00:02:48.940> prepared<00:02:49.120> for<00:02:49.660> things<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.230> you're

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
to be prepared for things that you're

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.010 
to be prepared for things that you're
not<00:02:51.100> expecting<00:02:52.590> choice<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.830> big<00:02:54.040> word

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020

Western language people today want is a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.280 
Western language people today want is a

choice of what they acquire I think with

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.660 
choice of what they acquire I think with
the<00:03:02.380> new<00:03:02.500> screening<00:03:02.830> program<00:03:03.340> that's<00:03:03.520> being

you
I<00:03:53.709> think<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.769> frightening<00:03:55.220> thing<00:03:55.780> would<00:03:56.780> that

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
I think the frightening thing would that

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.500 
I think the frightening thing would that
perception<00:03:57.769> that<00:03:57.950> children<00:03:58.730> at<00:03:58.790> dominate<00:03:59.390> was

perception that children at dominate was

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.059 
perception that children at dominate was
dancing<00:03:59.959> may<00:04:00.200> become<00:04:00.470> more<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.769> minority

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
successful whereas that the program

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.650

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.960 
disability that they may eventually get
rid<00:04:14.989> of<00:04:15.019> but<00:04:15.769> i<00:04:15.980> think<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.370> screening<00:04:16.669> program

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
rid of but i think the screening program

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.569 
rid of but i think the screening program
will<00:04:17.090> extend<00:04:17.479> to<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.109> intron<00:04:18.500> get<00:04:19.190> rid<00:04:19.430> of

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
will extend to the intron get rid of

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.780 
will extend to the intron get rid of
other<00:04:20.329> disabilities<00:04:21.079> I<00:04:21.460> think<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.580> for

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
other disabilities I think the for

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.520 
other disabilities I think the for
screening<00:04:23.210> programs<00:04:23.600> came<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:24.110> people<00:04:24.440> were

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
screening programs came and people were

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.290 
screening programs came and people were
more<00:04:24.680> accepting<00:04:25.190> that<00:04:25.310> they<00:04:25.490> just<00:04:25.639> would

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
more accepting that they just would

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.450 
more accepting that they just would
accept<00:04:26.810> what<00:04:27.080> was<00:04:27.650> offered<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.949> them<00:04:28.250> but

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
accept what was offered to them but

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.100 
accept what was offered to them but
today<00:04:28.699> they<00:04:28.820> have<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.000> choice

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
aborted I think what that means is that

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.300 
aborted I think what that means is that
down<00:04:57.230> syndrome<00:04:57.590> people<00:04:57.889> do<00:04:57.980> become<00:04:58.280> a

I<00:06:55.350> hopefully<00:06:56.120> had<00:06:57.120> the<00:06:57.240> idea<00:06:57.360> that<00:06:57.540> one<00:06:57.840> day

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
I hopefully had the idea that one day

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.130 
I hopefully had the idea that one day
she'd<00:06:58.170> make<00:06:58.320> it<00:06:58.470> and<00:06:58.590> Special<00:06:58.920> Olympics<00:07:00.050> but<00:07:01.050> I

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.140 
she'd make it and Special Olympics but I

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.840 
she'd make it and Special Olympics but I
think<00:07:01.320> she<00:07:01.410> do<00:07:01.500> really<00:07:01.740> well<00:07:01.860> she'd<00:07:02.130> love<00:07:02.280> it

we've<00:07:05.850> had<00:07:06.120> difficult<00:07:06.780> times<00:07:06.990> we<00:07:07.260> feel<00:07:07.530> have

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
we've had difficult times we feel have

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.200
