00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
here in orange and test facility we're

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.330 
here in orange and test facility we're
doing<00:01:22.990> all<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.290> things<00:01:23.530> you'd<00:01:23.740> expect<00:01:23.830> a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
doing all the things you'd expect a

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.390 
doing all the things you'd expect a
racing<00:01:24.760> team<00:01:24.790> to<00:01:25.240> be<00:01:25.360> doing<00:01:25.690> any<00:01:26.650> development

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
racing team to be doing any development

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.090 
racing team to be doing any development
we<00:01:27.550> dream<00:01:27.820> up<00:01:28.030> in<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.360> design<00:01:28.690> office<00:01:29.200> we<00:01:29.920> have

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
we dream up in the design office we have

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.480 
we dream up in the design office we have
to<00:01:30.250> validate<00:01:30.430> here<00:01:31.110> unreal<00:01:32.110> engines<00:01:32.770> before

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
to validate here unreal engines before

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.570 
to validate here unreal engines before
it<00:01:33.940> can<00:01:34.119> go<00:01:34.240> into<00:01:34.450> production<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.340> here<00:01:36.550> we

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
it can go into production so here we

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.340 
it can go into production so here we
have<00:01:36.820> our<00:01:37.000> test<00:01:37.420> cell<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.979> inside<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:40.350> can

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
have our test cell and inside you can

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.990 
have our test cell and inside you can
see<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.880> have<00:01:42.910> an<00:01:43.180> engine<00:01:43.570> ready<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:44.080> be<00:01:44.200> tested

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
see we have an engine ready to be tested

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.400 
see we have an engine ready to be tested
see<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:46.210> we<00:01:46.300> have<00:01:46.330> all<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.810> required<00:01:47.020> safety

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
see that we have all the required safety

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.340 
see that we have all the required safety
features<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:49.180> also<00:01:49.570> all<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.780> temperature

cell<00:01:58.770> around<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.950> side<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.759> can<00:02:00.940> see<00:02:00.970> all<00:02:01.330> the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
cell around the side you can see all the

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.480 
cell around the side you can see all the
coolant<00:02:01.990> that<00:02:02.140> we<00:02:02.320> have<00:02:02.560> required<00:02:02.979> for<00:02:03.399> the

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
coolant that we have required for the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.410 
coolant that we have required for the
engine

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.410 

and<00:02:08.420> around<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.989> back<00:02:09.489> you<00:02:10.489> can<00:02:10.519> see<00:02:10.700> our

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
and around the back you can see our

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.940 
and around the back you can see our
two-stage<00:02:12.430> series<00:02:13.430> turbo<00:02:13.760> chargers<00:02:14.739> so<00:02:15.739> take

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
two-stage series turbo chargers so take

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.369 
two-stage series turbo chargers so take
these<00:02:16.129> turbo<00:02:16.580> chargers<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.420> say<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:18.019> want<00:02:18.170> to

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
these turbo chargers and say we want to

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.860 
these turbo chargers and say we want to
make<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.560> design<00:02:18.980> change<00:02:19.390> first<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.599> all<00:02:20.690> we

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
make a design change first of all we

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.350 
make a design change first of all we
model<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.410> design<00:02:21.799> but<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:22.790> have<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.150> validate

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
model the design but we have to validate

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.860 
model the design but we have to validate
that<00:02:23.690> model<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.920> here<00:02:25.129> in<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.430> test<00:02:25.670> lab<00:02:26.000> we've

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
that model so here in the test lab we've

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.410 
that model so here in the test lab we've
run<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.349> baseline<00:02:27.920> engine<00:02:28.519> configuration

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
run a baseline engine configuration

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.360 
run a baseline engine configuration
taking<00:02:30.410> all<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.620> measurements<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.160> we

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
taking all the measurements that we

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.390 
taking all the measurements that we
require<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.930> then<00:02:33.110> go<00:02:33.260> back<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.010> model

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
require so you then go back to the model

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.699 
require so you then go back to the model
and<00:02:34.610> look<00:02:35.150> at<00:02:35.299> different<00:02:35.660> designs<00:02:36.049> and<00:02:36.440> create

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
and look at different designs and create

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.100 
and look at different designs and create
a<00:02:36.739> computational<00:02:37.610> prediction<00:02:38.209> on<00:02:38.420> how<00:02:39.049> the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
a computational prediction on how the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.080 
a computational prediction on how the
airflow<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.220> going<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.519> be<00:02:40.610> improved<00:02:40.940> through

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
airflow is going to be improved through

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.600 
airflow is going to be improved through
the<00:02:41.329> engine<00:02:41.510> but<00:02:42.319> improving<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:43.250> combustion

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
the engine but improving the combustion

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.789 
the engine but improving the combustion
efficiency<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.079> fish<00:02:45.319> overall

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
efficiency and the fish overall

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.509 
efficiency and the fish overall
efficiency<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.579> engine<00:02:48.099> so<00:02:49.099> you<00:02:49.190> only

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
efficiency of the engine so you only

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.089 
efficiency of the engine so you only
have<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.819> go<00:02:50.030> back<00:02:50.329> to<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.780> engine<00:02:51.319> for<00:02:52.040> a

have to go back to the engine for a
final<00:02:52.690> calibration<00:02:53.690> validation<00:02:53.840> and

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
final calibration validation and
