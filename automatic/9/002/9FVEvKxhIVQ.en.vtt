00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.150 

this<00:00:20.369> move<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.060> German<00:00:21.420> suplex<00:00:21.710> there<00:00:22.710> are

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
this move is the German suplex there are

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160 
this move is the German suplex there are
two<00:00:23.279> versions<00:00:23.490> there's<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:24.660> version<00:00:25.050> where

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
two versions there's one version where

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.779 
two versions there's one version where
you<00:00:25.199> release<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:25.980> let<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> person<00:00:26.580> wait

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
you release and you let the person wait

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.849 
you release and you let the person wait
for<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.150> take<00:00:27.300> their<00:00:27.449> own<00:00:27.539> bump<00:00:27.859> there's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
for you to take their own bump there's

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.130 
for you to take their own bump there's
one<00:00:29.070> version<00:00:29.519> where<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.699> hold<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
one version where you hold on and it

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.930 
one version where you hold on and it
goes<00:00:31.410> into<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.769> pen<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:33.440> would<00:00:34.440> recommend<00:00:35.250> doing

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
goes into a pen I would recommend doing

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940 
goes into a pen I would recommend doing
the<00:00:36.149> release<00:00:36.420> version<00:00:36.660> first<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.469> practice

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the release version first in practice

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.770 
the release version first in practice
before<00:00:38.489> doing<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.180> version<00:00:39.540> where<00:00:39.750> you

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
before doing the version where you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.160 
before doing the version where you
bridge<00:00:40.110> into<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> pin<00:00:40.969> because<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.960> pin

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
bridge into a pin because the pin

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.779 
bridge into a pin because the pin
version<00:00:43.649> has<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.040> most<00:00:44.190> potential<00:00:44.760> for

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
version has the most potential for

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.840 
version has the most potential for
injury<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:46.160> obviously<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> most

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
injury and obviously is one of the most

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.979 
injury and obviously is one of the most
dangerous<00:00:48.000> moves<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> perform

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
dangerous moves for you to perform

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.930 
dangerous moves for you to perform
because<00:00:49.920> there's<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.250> lot<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.520> potential<00:00:50.910> for

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
because there's a lot of potential for

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.340 
because there's a lot of potential for
the<00:00:51.120> other<00:00:51.239> person<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> land<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> back<00:00:52.199> of

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
the other person to land on the back of

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
the other person to land on the back of
their<00:00:52.440> neck<00:00:52.620> which<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> why<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.670> pin<00:00:54.030> version

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
their neck which is why the pin version

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
their neck which is why the pin version
is<00:00:54.600> more<00:00:54.809> dangerous<00:00:55.320> because<00:00:56.070> you're<00:00:56.370> holding

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
is more dangerous because you're holding

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.040 
is more dangerous because you're holding
on<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.300> there's<00:00:57.480> nowhere<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.809> them

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
on to them so there's nowhere for them

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.009 
on to them so there's nowhere for them
to<00:00:58.109> go<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.890> something<00:00:59.340> gets<00:00:59.520> messed<00:00:59.760> up<00:01:03.019> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
to go if something gets messed up the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.120 
to go if something gets messed up the
main<00:01:04.229> thing<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.220> sure<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:07.130> can

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
main thing is to make sure that you can

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.469 
main thing is to make sure that you can
make<00:01:08.280> sure<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.880> them<00:01:09.060> real<00:01:09.270> low

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
make sure that you get them real low

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.080 
make sure that you get them real low
around<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> waist<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.549> high<00:01:11.760> here

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
around the waist and not up high here

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
around the waist and not up high here
around<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> chest<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.470> they<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.740> room<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
around the chest so they have room to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.609 
around the chest so they have room to
land<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> meteor<00:01:14.880> part<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> their<00:01:15.330> back

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
land on the meteor part of their back

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.480 
land on the meteor part of their back
instead<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> back<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.189> their<00:01:17.310> neck<00:01:17.460> or

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
instead of on the back of their neck or

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.080 
instead of on the back of their neck or
on<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> back<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.119> their<00:01:18.240> head<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.159> you<00:01:20.159> want

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
on the back of their head and you want

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.410 
on the back of their head and you want
to<00:01:21.240> hold<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> person<00:01:21.810> tight<00:01:22.460> while<00:01:23.460> while

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
to hold the person tight while while

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.499 
to hold the person tight while while
crouching<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.490> going<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.610> into<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> move<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
crouching and going up into the move and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
crouching and going up into the move and
then<00:01:28.080> once<00:01:28.320> you're<00:01:28.530> both<00:01:28.710> kind<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.460> air

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
then once you're both kind of in the air

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
you want to loosen up a little bit so

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
you want to loosen up a little bit so
they<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.740> room<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.100> away<00:01:32.220> from<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.700> so

they have room to not land on you and it

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
they have room to not land on you and it
pretty<00:01:36.119> much<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.360> kind<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.869> take<00:01:37.049> their<00:01:37.229> own
