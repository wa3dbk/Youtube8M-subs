let's turn that off alright welcome here
number<00:02:18.710> two<00:02:18.980> would<00:02:19.190> be<00:02:19.250> coconut<00:02:19.730> battery<00:02:20.450> this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
number two would be coconut battery this

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.530 
number two would be coconut battery this
is<00:02:21.260> basically<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.860> battery<00:02:22.310> more<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.120> for<00:02:23.480> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
is basically a battery more so for the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.680 
is basically a battery more so for the
MacBooks<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:25.370> pretty<00:02:25.790> much<00:02:25.940> tells<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.630> a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
MacBooks it pretty much tells you a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.260 
MacBooks it pretty much tells you a
history<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.470> all<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.680> your<00:02:27.950> battery<00:02:28.370> as<00:02:29.090> you

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
history of all of your battery as you

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.820 
history of all of your battery as you
can<00:02:29.420> see<00:02:29.600> here<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:29.960> is<00:02:30.110> when<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.320> first<00:02:30.560> got<00:02:30.770> my

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
can see here this is when I first got my

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.390 
can see here this is when I first got my
back<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.460> had<00:02:31.910> 100%<00:02:32.480> battery<00:02:32.900> usage<00:02:33.530> with<00:02:34.130> eight

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
back I had 100% battery usage with eight

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.700 
back I had 100% battery usage with eight
cycles<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.240> eventually<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.260> can<00:02:36.380> see<00:02:36.560> as<00:02:36.680> a

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
cycles and eventually you can see as a

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.220 
cycles and eventually you can see as a
deteriorate<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:38.240> can<00:02:38.390> see<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.720> battery<00:02:38.930> is

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
deteriorate you can see the battery is

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.560 
deteriorate you can see the battery is
charging<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:40.220> temperature<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:40.850> 32<00:02:41.270> point

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
charging the temperature is 32 point

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.260 
charging the temperature is 32 point
nine<00:02:41.690> degrees<00:02:42.080> Celsius<00:02:42.620> how<00:02:43.310> many<00:02:43.490> times<00:02:44.090> I

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
nine degrees Celsius how many times I

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.260 
nine degrees Celsius how many times I
charged<00:02:44.630> my<00:02:44.690> mouth<00:02:44.990> so<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.710> here<00:02:46.460> at<00:02:46.580> states<00:02:46.970> I

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
charged my mouth so I here at states I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
charged my mouth so I here at states I
charged<00:02:48.050> a<00:02:48.230> 192<00:02:49.130> times<00:02:49.420> my<00:02:50.420> Mac<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.840> one<00:02:51.080> year

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
charged a 192 times my Mac is one year

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.820 
charged a 192 times my Mac is one year
old<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.910> then<00:02:52.910> my<00:02:53.090> Mac<00:02:53.300> model<00:02:53.810> along<00:02:54.500> with<00:02:54.560> my

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
old and then my Mac model along with my

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.860 
old and then my Mac model along with my
battery<00:02:55.220> health<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.150> clear<00:02:56.450> in<00:02:56.540> charge

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
battery health and the clear in charge

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.910 
battery health and the clear in charge
so<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.950> nose<00:02:58.100> has<00:02:58.460> 94%<00:02:59.300> here<00:02:59.570> it<00:02:59.780> says<00:03:00.050> 98%

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
so if a nose has 94% here it says 98%

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.640 
so if a nose has 94% here it says 98%
there<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.970> it's<00:03:02.120> pretty<00:03:02.180> contradictory<00:03:03.020> and

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
there so it's pretty contradictory and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.240 
there so it's pretty contradictory and
number<00:03:04.460> one<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.940> TextWrangler

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
number one is TextWrangler

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.150 
number one is TextWrangler
so<00:03:07.250> this<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.820> scripting<00:03:08.630> application<00:03:09.290> you

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
so this is a scripting application you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.750 
so this is a scripting application you
could<00:03:10.340> use<00:03:10.550> it<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:11.000> write<00:03:11.150> applications<00:03:12.760> or

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
could use it to write applications or

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.160 
could use it to write applications or
for<00:03:14.120> programming<00:03:14.690> sort<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:17.420> it's<00:03:17.780> very<00:03:18.050> much

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
for programming sort and it's very much

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.199 
for programming sort and it's very much
similar<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.620> notepad<00:03:19.190> plus<00:03:19.490> plus<00:03:19.520> you<00:03:20.030> can

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
similar to notepad plus plus you can

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.350 
similar to notepad plus plus you can
save<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.480> copy<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:21.260> FTP<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:22.730> can<00:03:22.910> change<00:03:23.180> the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
save a copy to FTP you can change the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.070 
save a copy to FTP you can change the
language<00:03:23.530> Multi<00:03:24.530> lines<00:03:25.060> etc<00:03:26.060> this<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.840> similar

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
language Multi lines etc this is similar

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.390 
language Multi lines etc this is similar
