00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
entire back now what this is going to do

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.979 
entire back now what this is going to do
is<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.430> allow<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.210> gallium<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
is it's going to allow the gallium to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.219 
is it's going to allow the gallium to
seep<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.470> much<00:01:05.430> easier<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.180> diffuse<00:01:06.720> into<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
seep in much easier and diffuse into the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.700 
seep in much easier and diffuse into the
aluminum<00:01:07.760> much<00:01:08.760> quicker<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:10.590> much

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
