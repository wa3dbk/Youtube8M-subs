00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
the most important pages in this book is

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.850 
the most important pages in this book is
right<00:00:07.740> here<00:00:09.530> this<00:00:10.530> shows<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.800> diagram<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:12.860> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
right here this shows a diagram of the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.400 
right here this shows a diagram of the
de<00:00:14.219> Laval<00:00:15.289> nozzle<00:00:16.289> principle<00:00:17.630> right<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:19.050> we

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
de Laval nozzle principle right here we

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.380 
de Laval nozzle principle right here we
have<00:00:19.560> steam<00:00:19.830> entering<00:00:20.310> at<00:00:20.640> 150<00:00:21.449> psi<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:23.390> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
have steam entering at 150 psi as the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.960 
have steam entering at 150 psi as the
steam<00:00:24.660> enters<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.380> then<00:00:26.039> starts<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.550> expand

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
steam enters and then starts to expand

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.830 
steam enters and then starts to expand
again<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.960> velocity<00:00:28.529> increases<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.840> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
again the velocity increases and the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.180 
again the velocity increases and the
pressure<00:00:31.080> drops<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:34.410> turbine<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:35.010> have

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
pressure drops so in my turbine we have

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.030 
pressure drops so in my turbine we have

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.130 
science manuals it's a really good book
and<00:02:28.180> it's<00:02:29.579> 1909<00:02:30.579> I<00:02:30.970> think<00:02:31.450> this<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.659> the<00:02:31.720> update

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
and it's 1909 I think this is the update

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.500 
and it's 1909 I think this is the update
of<00:02:32.290> 1909<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:33.609> it<00:02:33.760> does<00:02:33.939> have<00:02:34.120> turbine

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
of 1909 so it does have turbine

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.240 
of 1909 so it does have turbine
information<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.769> year<00:02:39.040> that

Tesla also came out with his

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.280 
Tesla also came out with his
revolutionary<00:02:42.819> turbine<00:02:43.359> which<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:44.139> not

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
revolutionary turbine which is not

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.530 
revolutionary turbine which is not
mentioned<00:02:44.709> in<00:02:44.769> here<00:02:45.040> but<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.519> full<00:02:46.420> of

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
mentioned in here but this is full of

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.030 
mentioned in here but this is full of
boiler<00:02:46.870> information<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.709> kind<00:02:48.010> of

boiler information and that kind of

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.690 
boiler information and that kind of
thing<00:02:48.129> where<00:02:49.139> steam<00:02:50.139> engines<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.769> governors

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
thing where steam engines and governors

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.280

and that kind of stuff it's great book
so<00:02:54.189> that's<00:02:54.370> heat<00:02:54.609> engines<00:02:55.060> don't<00:02:55.419> be<00:02:55.599> fooled

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
so that's heat engines don't be fooled

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.770 
so that's heat engines don't be fooled
by<00:02:56.260> Ripper<00:02:57.129> there's<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.700> lot<00:02:57.939> of<00:02:57.970> heat<00:02:58.389> engine

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
by Ripper there's a lot of heat engine

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.020 
by Ripper there's a lot of heat engine
books<00:02:59.049> but<00:02:59.379> this<00:02:59.950> one's<00:03:00.220> by<00:03:00.459> Ripper<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:00.849> it
