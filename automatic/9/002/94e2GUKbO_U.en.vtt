the<00:01:16.080> guy<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.350> gameplay<00:01:16.560> he's<00:01:16.950> obviously

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the guy in this gameplay he's obviously

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.679 
the guy in this gameplay he's obviously
really<00:01:17.430> good<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:17.880> call<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.119> duty<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.509> that's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
really good at call of duty and that's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.999 
really good at call of duty and that's
not<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.140> he<00:01:19.290> plays<00:01:19.530> all<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.770> time

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
not just because he plays all the time

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.890 
not just because he plays all the time
that's<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:20.700> he<00:01:20.790> practices<00:01:21.509> that's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
that's because he practices that's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.480 
that's because he practices that's
because<00:01:22.140> he<00:01:22.229> probably<00:01:22.439> learns<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.070> routes<00:01:23.280> of

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
because he probably learns the routes of

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
because he probably learns the routes of
people<00:01:23.759> that's<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.840> lot<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.170> factors

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
people that's it it's a lot of factors

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.960

that<00:02:40.350> people<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:41.010> are<00:02:41.100> naturally<00:02:41.640> violent

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
that people that are naturally violent

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.000 
that people that are naturally violent
will<00:02:42.300> like<00:02:42.540> violent<00:02:43.020> video<00:02:43.110> games<00:02:43.470> just

will like violent video games just

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.860 
will like violent video games just
because<00:02:44.070> they're<00:02:44.490> naturally<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> violent

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
because they're naturally a violent

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.440 
because they're naturally a violent
person<00:02:46.200> an<00:02:46.620> aggressive<00:02:47.250> person<00:02:47.520> i<00:02:47.910> don't

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
person an aggressive person i don't

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.170 
person an aggressive person i don't
think<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.780> gaming<00:02:49.400> creates<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.730> violent

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
think that gaming creates a violent

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.180 
think that gaming creates a violent
person<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.690> think<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:52.170> everyone<00:02:52.470> can<00:02:52.890> handle

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.430 
person I think that everyone can handle
violence<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.910> if<00:02:54.360> you're<00:02:54.570> not<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> naturally

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440
