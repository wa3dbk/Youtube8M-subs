creeper can blow you up pretty easily

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.369

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
but they're very easy to deal with

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.310 
but they're very easy to deal with
otherwise<00:00:40.860> cave<00:00:41.730> spiders<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.079> much

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
otherwise cave spiders not so much

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.690 
otherwise cave spiders not so much
because<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.649> late<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> bite<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.460> once

into the ground if you look it's you
know<00:01:21.479> pretty<00:01:22.470> large<00:01:23.390> took<00:01:24.390> me<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> little<00:01:24.659> bit

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
know pretty large took me a little bit

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.109 
know pretty large took me a little bit
here<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.380> build<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> stairs<00:01:26.340> headed<00:01:26.850> down

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
here to build the stairs headed down

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:36.560 
here to build the stairs headed down
here<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.490> easiest<00:01:29.880> way<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:35.570> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
here but it was easiest way to do it so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020 
here but it was easiest way to do it so
we'll<00:01:36.810> head<00:01:37.020> over<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> things<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
we'll head over here one of the things I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.819 
we'll head over here one of the things I
do<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> prevent<00:01:39.810> myself<00:01:40.020> from<00:01:40.350> getting<00:01:40.560> lost

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829

battle it's um no I guess it makes
things<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.310> little<00:03:11.400> bit<00:03:11.550> more<00:03:11.730> interesting<00:03:12.170> but

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
things a little bit more interesting but

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.200 
things a little bit more interesting but

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
again but yeah so cave spiders real

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.330 
again but yeah so cave spiders real
deadly<00:03:22.050> they're<00:03:22.230> fast<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.130> course

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
deadly they're fast and of course

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.630 
deadly they're fast and of course
they're<00:03:23.490> venomous<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:26.070> got<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.310> watch<00:03:26.430> out

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
they're venomous so you got to watch out

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.190 
they're venomous so you got to watch out
for<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.120> it's<00:03:27.360> really<00:03:27.450> easy<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.990> find

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
for that and it's really easy to find

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.290 
for that and it's really easy to find
out<00:03:28.410> when<00:03:28.680> you're<00:03:28.830> close<00:03:29.130> or<00:03:29.520> I<00:03:29.790> guess

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
out when you're close or I guess

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.030
