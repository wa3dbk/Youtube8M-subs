00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the things you have here because some of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.690 
the things you have here because some of
these<00:00:40.350> look<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.649> they<00:00:40.829> did<00:00:40.890> lend<00:00:41.340> themselves

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
these look like they did lend themselves

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.520 
these look like they did lend themselves
to<00:00:41.790> muscle<00:00:42.149> car<00:00:42.270> applications<00:00:42.719> they<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.170> we

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
to muscle car applications they do we

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.260 
to muscle car applications they do we
actually<00:00:43.710> build<00:00:44.040> some<00:00:44.340> specifically<00:00:45.000> for

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
actually build some specifically for

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.420 
actually build some specifically for
that<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.989> take<00:00:46.170> our<00:00:46.379> racing<00:00:46.770> heritage<00:00:47.010> that

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that we take our racing heritage that

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.029 
that we take our racing heritage that
we've<00:00:47.579> done<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.149> over<00:00:48.629> 25<00:00:49.050> years<00:00:49.079> going<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.739> 30

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
we've done for over 25 years going on 30

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.770 
we've done for over 25 years going on 30
years<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.360> taking<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
years and actually just taking that

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.479 
years and actually just taking that
technology<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.530> those<00:00:52.680> qualities<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.219> all

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
technology and those qualities and all

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.490 
technology and those qualities and all
those<00:00:53.610> characteristics<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.510> made<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
those characteristics and made it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.560 
those characteristics and made it
available<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> street<00:00:56.280> we've<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.059> this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
available for the street we've got this

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.150 
available for the street we've got this
is<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> good<00:00:58.109> example<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.829> our<00:00:58.949> latest

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
is a good example of one of our latest

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.700 
is a good example of one of our latest
radiators<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.660> an<00:01:00.780> LS<00:01:01.170> conversion

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
radiators it's actually an LS conversion

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.280 
radiators it's actually an LS conversion
radiator<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> first-gen<00:01:02.850> Camaro<00:01:02.930> a<00:01:03.930> lot<00:01:04.170> of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
radiator for a first-gen Camaro a lot of

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.810 
radiator for a first-gen Camaro a lot of
guys<00:01:04.409> were<00:01:04.680> putting<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> LS<00:01:05.189> engines<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.729> them

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
guys were putting the LS engines in them

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.060 
guys were putting the LS engines in them
so<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.540> kind<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.140> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.409> one-up<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.890> deal

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
so we kind of kind of one-up the deal

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.590 
so we kind of kind of one-up the deal
instead<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.670> making<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.060> fit<00:01:09.210> an<00:01:09.299> LS

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
instead of just making it fit an LS

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
instead of just making it fit an LS
engine<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.140> things<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.340> LS

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
engine and things like that the LS

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.390 
engine and things like that the LS
engine<00:01:12.060> design<00:01:12.840> has<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.220> run

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
engine design has it so you have to run

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.980 
engine design has it so you have to run
the<00:01:14.520> upper<00:01:14.729> radiator<00:01:14.909> hose<00:01:15.150> across<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the upper radiator hose across the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.330 
the upper radiator hose across the
engine<00:01:16.259> compartment<00:01:16.500> which<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.009> lot<00:01:17.189> of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
engine compartment which a lot of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.760 
engine compartment which a lot of
builders<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:19.020> put<00:01:19.259> both<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
builders don't like that we put both the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.740 
builders don't like that we put both the
hoses<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> same<00:01:20.610> side<00:01:20.909> which<00:01:21.210> gives<00:01:21.450> us<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
hoses on the same side which gives us a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.719 
hoses on the same side which gives us a
double<00:01:22.140> pass<00:01:22.350> radiator<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.130> about<00:01:23.280> 15

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
double pass radiator it's about 15

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
double pass radiator it's about 15
percent<00:01:24.150> more<00:01:24.210> efficient<00:01:24.869> we've<00:01:25.229> got<00:01:25.409> also

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
percent more efficient we've got also

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.530 
percent more efficient we've got also
got<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.009> new<00:01:26.310> look<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.909> want<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.390> tell

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
got this new look I want to tell

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.330 
got this new look I want to tell
everybody<00:01:27.810> about<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> baddest

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
everybody about this this is the baddest

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.990 
everybody about this this is the baddest
bed

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
bed

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
bed
it's<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.780> call<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.990> stealth<00:01:31.320> black<00:01:31.560> look

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it's what we call a stealth black look

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
it's what we call a stealth black look
we<00:01:32.040> call<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> classic<00:01:32.820> look<00:01:32.970> also<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.720> their

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
we call a classic look also for their

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.319 
we call a classic look also for their
street<00:01:34.110> rods<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> 32<00:01:35.430> Ford's<00:01:35.909> things<00:01:36.150> like

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
street rods or the 32 Ford's things like

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.380 
street rods or the 32 Ford's things like
that<00:01:36.540> yeah<00:01:37.100> this<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> flat<00:01:39.030> black

horsepower and I'll tell you what it
gets<00:03:25.070> down<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.280> I've<00:03:25.550> answered<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.850> lot<00:03:25.970> of

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
gets down to I've answered a lot of

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.060 
gets down to I've answered a lot of
questions<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.570> week<00:03:27.110> pertaining<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.920> that

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
questions this week pertaining to that

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.280 
questions this week pertaining to that
what<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:28.820> really<00:03:29.060> gets<00:03:29.209> down<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:29.989> as<00:03:30.230> a

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
what it really gets down to is as a

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.500 
what it really gets down to is as a
formula<00:03:30.560> we<00:03:30.739> use<00:03:31.010> it's<00:03:31.430> tried-and-true<00:03:32.090> it

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
formula we use it's tried-and-true it

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.190 
formula we use it's tried-and-true it
works<00:03:32.860> for<00:03:33.860> all<00:03:34.160> America<00:03:34.700> they're<00:03:35.030> one<00:03:35.870> square

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
works for all America they're one square

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.979 
works for all America they're one square
inch<00:03:36.410> of<00:03:36.560> core<00:03:37.090> for<00:03:38.090> every<00:03:38.330> horsepower<00:03:38.660> you're

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
inch of core for every horsepower you're

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.380 
inch of core for every horsepower you're
producing<00:03:39.400> if<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:40.580> go<00:03:40.730> with<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:40.940> golden

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
producing if you go with that golden

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.199 
producing if you go with that golden
rule<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.830> won't<00:03:42.830> go<00:03:42.950> wrong<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:43.970> cheat

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
rule you won't go wrong you can cheat

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.850 
rule you won't go wrong you can cheat
that<00:03:44.239> a<00:03:44.450> little<00:03:44.780> bit<00:03:44.959> but<00:03:45.290> maybe<00:03:45.410> putting<00:03:45.769> the

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
that a little bit but maybe putting the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.009 
that a little bit but maybe putting the
transmission<00:03:46.580> cooler<00:03:46.760> as<00:03:47.090> an<00:03:47.360> external<00:03:47.690> cools

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
transmission cooler as an external cools

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.110 
transmission cooler as an external cools
effort<00:03:48.380> yeah<00:03:48.590> yeah<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.400> can<00:03:49.580> also<00:03:49.760> buy<00:03:50.090> a

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
effort yeah yeah you can also buy a

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.090 
effort yeah yeah you can also buy a
little<00:03:50.450> bit<00:03:50.570> of<00:03:50.660> extra<00:03:50.870> cooling<00:03:51.470> capacity<00:03:51.980> but

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
little bit of extra cooling capacity but

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.040 
little bit of extra cooling capacity but
putting<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.400> good<00:03:52.610> fan

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
putting a good fan

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.440 
putting a good fan
crowd<00:03:53.350> a<00:03:53.680> good<00:03:54.100> seal<00:03:54.340> one<00:03:54.580> you<00:03:54.910> know<00:03:55.000> seen<00:03:55.240> kind

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
crowd a good seal one you know seen kind

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.210 
crowd a good seal one you know seen kind
of<00:03:55.540> cheat<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.840> up<00:03:55.960> a<00:03:56.080> little<00:03:56.200> bit<00:03:56.470> but<00:03:57.040> if<00:03:57.130> you

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
of cheat it up a little bit but if you

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.040 
of cheat it up a little bit but if you
go<00:03:57.370> over<00:03:57.550> that<00:03:57.580> Golden<00:03:58.030> Rule<00:03:58.210> you<00:03:58.750> won't<00:03:58.930> go

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
go over that Golden Rule you won't go

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.900 
go over that Golden Rule you won't go
wrong<00:03:59.080> so<00:03:59.650> one<00:03:59.800> square<00:04:00.070> inch<00:04:00.280> per<00:04:00.520> horsepower

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
wrong so one square inch per horsepower

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.350 
wrong so one square inch per horsepower
now<00:04:01.360> something<00:04:01.750> like<00:04:01.780> this<00:04:03.210> are<00:04:04.210> we're

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
now something like this are we're

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.440 
now something like this are we're
talking<00:04:04.780> different<00:04:04.960> core<00:04:05.650> thickness<00:04:06.190> or<00:04:06.460> glad

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
talking different core thickness or glad

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.060 
talking different core thickness or glad
you<00:04:07.630> asked<00:04:07.810> that<00:04:07.960> you're<00:04:08.350> hearing<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.650> lot<00:04:08.920> in

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
you asked that you're hearing a lot in

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.070 
you asked that you're hearing a lot in
the<00:04:09.160> market<00:04:09.490> out<00:04:09.610> there<00:04:09.640> about<00:04:09.940> triple<00:04:10.840> core

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
the market out there about triple core

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.380 
the market out there about triple core
four<00:04:11.710> core<00:04:12.160> all<00:04:12.580> these<00:04:12.970> different<00:04:13.360> things

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
four core all these different things

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.180 
four core all these different things
tell<00:04:13.840> that<00:04:13.960> they<00:04:14.170> could<00:04:14.350> have<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.740> old<00:04:14.950> copper

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
tell that they could have the old copper

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.360 
tell that they could have the old copper
brass<00:04:15.520> were<00:04:15.840> really<00:04:16.840> what<00:04:17.380> happens<00:04:17.830> is<00:04:18.010> let's

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
brass were really what happens is let's

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.920 
brass were really what happens is let's
just<00:04:18.459> exaggerate<00:04:19.269> it<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.450> let's<00:04:19.600> go<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.840> the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
just exaggerate it and let's go to the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.440 
just exaggerate it and let's go to the
highest<00:04:20.110> one<00:04:20.290> which<00:04:20.560> is<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.709> four<00:04:21.010> core<00:04:21.450> no

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
highest one which is a four core no

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.330 
highest one which is a four core no
doubt<00:04:22.660> about<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:22.990> there's<00:04:23.620> more<00:04:23.920> cooling

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
doubt about it there's more cooling

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.270 
doubt about it there's more cooling
surface<00:04:24.760> there<00:04:24.970> however<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.560> still<00:04:26.770> have<00:04:27.010> to

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
surface there however you still have to

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.520 
surface there however you still have to
get<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.520> air<00:04:27.640> through<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.260> so<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.380> air

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
get the air through it so the air

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.460 
get the air through it so the air
forward<00:04:29.980> air<00:04:30.280> flow<00:04:30.670> goes<00:04:31.120> down<00:04:31.470> cooling

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
forward air flow goes down cooling

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.280 
forward air flow goes down cooling
surface<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:33.010> up<00:04:33.220> what<00:04:33.880> we<00:04:34.060> found<00:04:34.300> at<00:04:34.570> AAMCO<00:04:34.780> is

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.130 
surface is up what we found at AAMCO is
the<00:04:35.470> best<00:04:35.710> happy<00:04:36.100> medium<00:04:36.460> is<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:37.450> throw

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
the best happy medium is a to throw

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
the best happy medium is a to throw
radiator<00:04:39.090> one-inch<00:04:40.090> throws<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:41.800> gets<00:04:42.040> you

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
radiator one-inch throws that gets you

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.100 
radiator one-inch throws that gets you
the<00:04:42.280> best<00:04:42.310> balance<00:04:43.000> between<00:04:43.180> airflow<00:04:43.810> and
