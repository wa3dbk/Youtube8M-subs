00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
like moving a lot why are these alive

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.430 
like moving a lot why are these alive
now<00:00:31.289> look<00:00:31.550> you<00:00:32.550> guys<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:33.320> biologist<00:00:34.320> or

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
now look you guys a biologist or

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.020 
now look you guys a biologist or
biologist<00:00:35.160> wannabes<00:00:35.640> their<00:00:35.820> budding

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
biologist wannabes their budding

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.580 
biologist wannabes their budding
biologists<00:00:36.780> or<00:00:36.870> whatever<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.320> we're<00:00:37.469> gonna

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
biologists or whatever it is we're gonna

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.139 
biologists or whatever it is we're gonna
call<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.890> fact<00:00:38.219> we're<00:00:38.460> all<00:00:38.520> biologists

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
call it fact we're all biologists

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.910 
call it fact we're all biologists
wannabes<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> very<00:00:40.469> first<00:00:40.770> question

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
wannabes and so the very first question

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.310 
wannabes and so the very first question
we<00:00:41.340> need<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.520> ask<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.090> why<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.780> these<00:00:42.989> alive

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
we need to ask is why are these alive

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.010 
we need to ask is why are these alive
and<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.370> second<00:00:44.789> question<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.960> have

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and the second question is do I have

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
and the second question is do I have
paper<00:00:46.410> towels<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:47.070> wipe<00:00:47.190> my<00:00:47.399> hands<00:00:47.820> with

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
paper towels to wipe my hands with

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.729 
paper towels to wipe my hands with
because<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.930> tell<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.110> another<00:00:49.379> thing<00:00:49.500> as

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
because I can tell you another thing as

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.889 
because I can tell you another thing as
they're<00:00:49.920> pretty<00:00:50.129> slimy<00:00:50.489> too<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.780> know

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
they're pretty slimy too but you know

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.279 
they're pretty slimy too but you know
the<00:00:52.890> key<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.430> whole<00:00:53.699> story<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.360> life<00:00:54.989> is

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the key to this whole story of life is

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.520 
the key to this whole story of life is
and<00:00:56.100> biology<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.719> makes<00:00:58.140> something

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and biology is what makes something

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.119 
and biology is what makes something
alive<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:59.460> makes<00:00:59.789> something<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
alive what makes something that that a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.539 
alive what makes something that that a
biologist<00:01:03.120> sees<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.840> says<00:01:04.680> cool<00:01:05.189> that's

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
biologist sees and says cool that's

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.719 
biologist sees and says cool that's
alive<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.630> gives<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.500> life<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
alive what gives it life and and the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.100 
alive what gives it life and and the
other<00:01:08.880> question<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.479> need<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> ask<00:01:09.869> ourselves

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
other question we need to ask ourselves

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.420 
other question we need to ask ourselves
is<00:01:10.729> if<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.909> know<00:01:12.090> something<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.630> alive<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:14.220> what

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
is if we know something is alive so what

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.850 
is if we know something is alive so what
what<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.270> biologists<00:01:15.960> gonna<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.350> about

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
what are we as biologists gonna do about

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.890 
what are we as biologists gonna do about
that<00:01:17.070> thing<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:18.030> what<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:18.509> gonna<00:01:18.630> do

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that thing and what we are gonna do

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.330 
that thing and what we are gonna do
about<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.290> thing<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.220> an

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
about that thing because we have an

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.370 
about that thing because we have an
intellectual<00:01:20.759> curiosity<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.960> we're<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
intellectual curiosity is we're going to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.520 
intellectual curiosity is we're going to
describe<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.729> describing<00:01:24.530> what

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
describe it because in describing what

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.100 
describe it because in describing what
makes<00:01:25.860> something<00:01:26.159> alive<00:01:26.540> we<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:27.930> can

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
makes something alive we can we can

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.560 
makes something alive we can we can
literally<00:01:28.520> take<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> look<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.299> big<00:01:30.540> picture

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
literally take a look at the big picture

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.249 
literally take a look at the big picture
now<00:01:31.439> these<00:01:32.040> things<00:01:32.400> are<00:01:32.850> alive<00:01:33.329> well<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.110> they

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
now these things are alive well do they

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.399 
now these things are alive well do they
contain<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.979> same<00:01:35.220> life<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
contain the same life and and and and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.429 
contain the same life and and and and
living<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.150> contain<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
living this that I contain that a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.190 
living this that I contain that a
bacterium<00:01:41.040> contains<00:01:41.540> what<00:01:42.540> makes<00:01:42.899> something

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
bacterium contains what makes something

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.249 
bacterium contains what makes something
alive<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> turns<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:45.899> we

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
alive and it turns out that that as we

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
alive and it turns out that that as we
learn<00:01:46.560> more<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.100> more<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.460> biology<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
learn more and more about biology and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.230 
learn more and more about biology and
and<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.220> environment<00:01:50.759> around<00:01:50.880> us

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and and and the environment around us

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.120 
and and and the environment around us
that<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.140> key<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.159> life<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:54.380> organization<00:01:55.380> let

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
that the key to life is organization let

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.380 
that the key to life is organization let
me<00:01:56.219> show<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.579> mean<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:59.369> know

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
me show you what I mean you know

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.960 
me show you what I mean you know
I've<00:02:02.390> often<00:02:02.660> said<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.140> my<00:02:03.260> students<00:02:03.710> that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
I've often said to my students that

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.220 
I've often said to my students that
taking<00:02:04.970> chemistry<00:02:05.480> and<00:02:05.630> physics<00:02:06.050> is<00:02:06.170> very

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
taking chemistry and physics is very

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.440 
taking chemistry and physics is very
very<00:02:06.800> important<00:02:07.370> and<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.910> reason<00:02:07.940> it's

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
very important and the reason it's

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.900 
very important and the reason it's
important<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.110> can<00:02:09.290> become<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.649> biologist

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
important so you can become a biologist

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.850 
important so you can become a biologist
because<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.090> really<00:02:11.330> understand<00:02:12.050> life<00:02:12.350> you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
because to really understand life you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.890 
because to really understand life you
have<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.130> understand<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:14.270> way<00:02:14.420> things<00:02:14.690> work

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
have to understand the way things work

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.410 
have to understand the way things work
at<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.830> subatomic<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.880> atomic<00:02:17.210> level

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
at the subatomic and the atomic level

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.050 
at the subatomic and the atomic level
you<00:02:18.140> see<00:02:18.350> look<00:02:19.160> you're<00:02:19.640> made<00:02:19.820> out<00:02:19.850> of

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
you see look you're made out of

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.400 
you see look you're made out of
molecules<00:02:20.210> you<00:02:20.600> know<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:21.020> you're<00:02:21.170> made<00:02:21.380> out

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
of molecules those things that we're

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.770 
of molecules those things that we're
just<00:02:22.850> squirming<00:02:23.210> around<00:02:23.300> they're<00:02:23.510> made<00:02:23.660> out

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
just squirming around they're made out

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.300 
just squirming around they're made out
of<00:02:23.900> molecules<00:02:24.050> what<00:02:24.500> are<00:02:24.590> molecules<00:02:24.740> made<00:02:25.190> out

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
of molecules what are molecules made out

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.870 
of molecules what are molecules made out

physicists<00:02:30.470> will<00:02:30.560> take<00:02:30.710> even<00:02:30.860> deeper<00:02:31.340> than

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
physicists will take even deeper than

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.950 
physicists will take even deeper than
that<00:02:31.520> they'll<00:02:31.850> talk<00:02:32.030> about<00:02:32.060> neutrinos<00:02:32.780> and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
that they'll talk about neutrinos and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.260 
that they'll talk about neutrinos and
antineutrinos<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:34.550> know<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:35.060> know<00:02:35.150> how<00:02:35.209> that

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
antineutrinos you know you know how that

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.620 
antineutrinos you know you know how that
goes<00:02:35.600> but<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.410> key<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.250> when<00:02:38.090> we<00:02:38.270> get<00:02:38.450> to

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
goes but the key is that when we get to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.240 
goes but the key is that when we get to
this<00:02:38.780> level<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.410> we<00:02:39.470> start<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.100> organize

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
this level and we start to organize

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.390 
this level and we start to organize
these<00:02:40.880> things<00:02:41.200> we<00:02:42.200> start<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.590> get<00:02:42.770> close<00:02:43.370> to

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
these things we start to get close to

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.930 
these things we start to get close to
life<00:02:43.820> but<00:02:44.420> then<00:02:44.570> I<00:02:44.600> can<00:02:44.840> ask<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.140> alright<00:02:45.470> is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
life but then I can ask you alright is

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.000 
life but then I can ask you alright is
this<00:02:46.940> made<00:02:47.209> out<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.540> subatomic<00:02:47.810> particles<00:02:48.020> you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
this made out of subatomic particles you

is<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:50.330> made<00:02:50.540> out<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.870> atoms<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:51.680> betcha<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.250> it

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
is it made out of atoms you betcha is it

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.580 
is it made out of atoms you betcha is it
made<00:02:53.060> out<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.209> molecules<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.930> bet<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.380> is

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
made out of molecules you bet you so is

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.990 
made out of molecules you bet you so is
it<00:02:54.770> alive<00:02:55.040> come<00:02:55.340> on<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:55.640> got<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.880> whole

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
it alive come on it's got the whole

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
it alive come on it's got the whole
things<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.480> answer<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:56.750> no<00:02:56.900> because

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
things and the answer is no because

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.110 
things and the answer is no because
somewhere<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:57.830> between<00:02:58.540> molecules

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120

to life right in that box right there
now<00:03:38.239> we<00:03:38.299> know<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.720> tissues<00:03:39.170> are<00:03:39.380> organized

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
now we know the tissues are organized

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.100 
now we know the tissues are organized
into<00:03:40.459> organs<00:03:40.850> you<00:03:41.269> hear<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.570> word<00:03:41.690> organized

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
into organs you hear the word organized

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.690 
into organs you hear the word organized
coming<00:03:42.440> over<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.769> over<00:03:42.980> again<00:03:43.100> what<00:03:43.519> did<00:03:43.580> I

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
coming over and over again what did I

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.289 
coming over and over again what did I
say<00:03:43.910> -<00:03:44.360> life<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.230> orderly<00:03:46.060> organization<00:03:47.060> is

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
say - life is orderly organization is

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.600 
say - life is orderly organization is
that<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.540> redundancy<00:03:48.049> I<00:03:48.410> don't<00:03:48.680> know<00:03:48.769> organs

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.379 
time ah ace an amoeba is an organism why
do<00:04:09.380> we<00:04:09.560> say<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.739> because<00:04:09.980> it's<00:04:10.250> alive<00:04:10.820> but

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
do we say that because it's alive but

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.629 
do we say that because it's alive but
it's<00:04:11.540> only<00:04:11.720> one<00:04:11.900> cell<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:13.100> sometimes<00:04:13.519> the

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
it's only one cell so sometimes the

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.559 
it's only one cell so sometimes the
words<00:04:13.790> get<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.000> little<00:04:14.239> bit<00:04:14.329> busy

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
words get a little bit busy

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.390 
words get a little bit busy
but<00:04:15.019> you're<00:04:15.109> gonna<00:04:15.230> have<00:04:15.379> fun<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.799> of<00:04:16.190> course

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
but you're gonna have fun and of course

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.789 
but you're gonna have fun and of course
then<00:04:16.549> we<00:04:16.639> get<00:04:16.729> to<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:16.970> ecological<00:04:17.329> level<00:04:18.049> the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
then we get to the ecological level the

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.520 
then we get to the ecological level the
interaction<00:04:19.729> level<00:04:19.910> okay<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.810> so<00:04:21.320> we'll<00:04:21.500> have

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
interaction level okay and so we'll have

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.249 
interaction level okay and so we'll have
populations<00:04:22.430> communities<00:04:23.259> ecosystems

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
populations communities ecosystems

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.290 
populations communities ecosystems
environments<00:04:24.979> and<00:04:25.100> eventually<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.090> world

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
environments and eventually the world

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.320 
environments and eventually the world
where<00:04:26.930> so<00:04:27.320> far<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.490> only<00:04:28.669> place<00:04:29.030> we<00:04:29.180> have

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
where so far is the only place we have

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.960 
where so far is the only place we have
found<00:04:29.570> life<00:04:29.900> but<00:04:30.380> you<00:04:30.500> know<00:04:30.530> who<00:04:30.919> knows<00:04:30.949> I<00:04:31.460> mean

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
found life but you know who knows I mean

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.029 
found life but you know who knows I mean
and<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.419> know<00:04:32.509> what<00:04:32.740> it's<00:04:33.740> kind<00:04:33.979> of

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
and and you know what it's kind of

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.589 
and and you know what it's kind of
interesting<00:04:34.310> if<00:04:34.669> you<00:04:34.970> were<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.150> take<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.360> look

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
interesting if you were to take a look

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.140 
interesting if you were to take a look
at<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.840> world<00:04:36.050> life<00:04:36.380> is<00:04:36.680> pretty<00:04:37.009> much<00:04:37.280> limited

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
at the world life is pretty much limited

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.240 
at the world life is pretty much limited
to<00:04:38.210> a<00:04:38.900> very<00:04:39.050> thin<00:04:39.440> layer<00:04:39.979> around<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:42.250> world

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
to a very thin layer around the world

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.469 
to a very thin layer around the world
you<00:04:43.520> know<00:04:43.639> I<00:04:43.820> don't<00:04:44.150> think<00:04:44.300> you're<00:04:44.389> gonna

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
you know I don't think you're gonna

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:45.760 
you know I don't think you're gonna
we're<00:04:44.780> ever<00:04:44.930> going<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.110> find<00:04:45.169> life<00:04:45.440> in<00:04:45.620> the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
we're ever going to find life in the

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.589 
we're ever going to find life in the
center<00:04:46.190> of<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.400> earth<00:04:46.430> although<00:04:47.330> you<00:04:47.389> know

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
center of the earth although you know

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.770 
center of the earth although you know
you<00:04:48.229> never<00:04:48.380> know<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.699> point<00:04:50.060> here<00:04:50.180> is<00:04:50.509> that

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
you never know so the point here is that

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.740 
you never know so the point here is that
in<00:04:51.229> order<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.680> be<00:04:51.860> alive<00:04:52.220> we<00:04:52.910> notice<00:04:53.539> what<00:04:53.720> I

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
in order to be alive we notice what I

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.770 
in order to be alive we notice what I
just<00:04:53.990> did<00:04:54.139> I<00:04:54.199> described<00:04:54.860> something<00:04:55.250> I

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
just did I described something I

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.589 
just did I described something I
described<00:04:56.780> what<00:04:57.139> it<00:04:57.229> is<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.680> be<00:04:57.830> alive<00:04:58.099> and

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
described what it is to be alive and

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.900 
described what it is to be alive and
something<00:04:59.599> like<00:04:59.630> this<00:05:00.050> which<00:05:00.590> isn't<00:05:00.830> alive<00:05:01.460> as

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
something like this which isn't alive as

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.400 
something like this which isn't alive as
far<00:05:02.900> as<00:05:03.199> I<00:05:03.259> know<00:05:03.320> all<00:05:03.710> right<00:05:04.539> lacks<00:05:05.539> that<00:05:05.870> that

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
far as I know all right lacks that that

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.249 
far as I know all right lacks that that
ability<00:05:06.919> it<00:05:07.099> has<00:05:07.160> organization<00:05:08.150> but<00:05:08.840> it<00:05:08.960> lacks

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
ability it has organization but it lacks

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:19.080 
ability it has organization but it lacks
that<00:05:09.500> ability<00:05:09.949> to<00:05:10.130> do<00:05:10.280> certain<00:05:10.520> other<00:05:10.729> things
