but the headsets really nice it has I'm
coming<00:00:55.890> down<00:00:56.010> from<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.520> Z<00:00:57.180> twos<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.170> turtle

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
coming down from the Z twos the turtle

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.670 
coming down from the Z twos the turtle
beach<00:00:58.590> your<00:00:59.129> 4c<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.670> headset<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.680> cup

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
beach your 4c to headset and the cup

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
beach your 4c to headset and the cup
size<00:01:01.949> they<00:01:02.160> say<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.609> same<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.449> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
size they say is the same I think it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.570 
size they say is the same I think it
might<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.140> five<00:01:04.500> millimeters<00:01:05.010> smaller

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
might be like five millimeters smaller

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.359 
might be like five millimeters smaller
so<00:01:06.180> they're<00:01:06.689> pretty<00:01:06.900> comfortable<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.950> mean

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
so they're pretty comfortable as I mean

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.010 
so they're pretty comfortable as I mean
they're<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:08.970> comfortable<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.450> e2s

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020

that<00:01:49.259> by<00:01:49.560> actually<00:01:49.920> paying<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.119> was

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that by actually paying for you it was

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.289 
that by actually paying for you it was
like<00:01:51.360> $20.00<00:01:51.899> more<00:01:52.049> expensive<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:54.119> was<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
like $20.00 more expensive and it was a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.300 
like $20.00 more expensive and it was a
lot<00:01:54.630> heavier<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> lot<00:01:55.439> more<00:01:55.680> excessive<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
lot heavier a lot more excessive and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.660 
lot heavier a lot more excessive and
every<00:01:57.119> single<00:01:57.299> review<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.750> saw<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.560> Amazon<00:01:59.430> or

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
every single review I saw on Amazon or

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.609 
every single review I saw on Amazon or
whatever<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.479> always<00:02:00.960> said<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.200> broke<00:02:01.469> in

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
whatever it always said that broke in

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.530 
whatever it always said that broke in
the<00:02:01.680> same<00:02:01.890> places<00:02:02.130> which<00:02:02.490> was<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.909> right

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the same places which was like right

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.810 
the same places which was like right
above<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.899> cup<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.530> was<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.310> equivalent<00:02:05.520> of

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
above the cup it was the equivalent of

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.240 
above the cup it was the equivalent of
that<00:02:06.689> little<00:02:06.899> piece<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.170> there<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.129> yeah

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that little piece right there so yeah

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.589 
that little piece right there so yeah
there<00:02:08.429> were<00:02:08.489> stress<00:02:08.879> marks<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.420> right

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
there were stress marks like right

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.300 
there were stress marks like right
around<00:02:09.720> there<00:02:09.989> every<00:02:10.440> single<00:02:10.590> review<00:02:10.860> said

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
around there every single review said

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.589 
around there every single review said
that<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.730> broke<00:02:11.970> right<00:02:12.000> there<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.450> it's

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
that it just broke right there and it's

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.910 
that it just broke right there and it's
a<00:02:12.629> poor

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
a poor

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.290 
a poor
they<00:02:12.980> made<00:02:13.130> headset<00:02:13.550> which<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.819> definitely

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
they made headset which I definitely

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.970 
they made headset which I definitely
believe<00:02:14.569> but<00:02:15.080> for<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.319> time<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.530> had<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:15.890> was

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
believe but for the time I had it was

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.920 
believe but for the time I had it was
really<00:02:16.190> nice<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.120> far<00:02:17.330> I've<00:02:17.450> had<00:02:17.510> these<00:02:17.720> for

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
really nice so far I've had these for

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.449

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.250 
about a month they're really nice and
one<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.209> main<00:02:20.450> reasons<00:02:20.810> doing<00:02:21.050> if<00:02:21.140> you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
one of the main reasons doing if you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.460 
one of the main reasons doing if you
want<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.739> didn't<00:02:22.370> see<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.580> single<00:02:23.209> video

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
want it is I didn't see a single video

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.990 
want it is I didn't see a single video
of<00:02:24.470> someone<00:02:24.860> actually<00:02:24.980> using<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.580> or<00:02:25.760> like

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
of someone actually using it or like

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.240 
of someone actually using it or like
having<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.780> review<00:02:27.140> like<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.410> saw<00:02:27.620> something<00:02:28.069> on

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
having a review like I saw something on

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.190 
having a review like I saw something on
you<00:02:28.730> that's<00:02:29.060> not<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.270> couple<00:02:29.600> videos<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:30.020> some

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
you that's not a couple videos of some

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.870 
you that's not a couple videos of some
people<00:02:30.410> using<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.709> but<00:02:30.920> wasn't<00:02:31.459> that<00:02:31.580> great

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
people using it but wasn't that great

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.559 
people using it but wasn't that great
and<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.650> got<00:02:33.830> your<00:02:33.980> audio<00:02:34.700> controls

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
and so you got your audio controls

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.840 
and so you got your audio controls
they're<00:02:35.930> not<00:02:36.350> as<00:02:36.500> fancy<00:02:36.770> as<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.069> z2<00:02:37.520> is<00:02:37.550> but

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
they're not as fancy as the z2 is but

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.030 
they're not as fancy as the z2 is but
it's<00:02:37.970> definitely<00:02:38.450> nice<00:02:39.200> got<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.680> little<00:02:39.860> clip

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
it's definitely nice got a little clip

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.040 
it's definitely nice got a little clip
you<00:02:40.220> can<00:02:40.360> put<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.630> shirt<00:02:41.810> or<00:02:41.930> something

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
you can put that in a shirt or something

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.110 
you can put that in a shirt or something
got<00:02:42.739> mute<00:02:43.040> got<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:44.000> volume<00:02:44.950> got<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.120> disconnect

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
got mute got the volume got a disconnect

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.640 
got mute got the volume got a disconnect
right<00:02:47.330> here<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.540> think<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.019> can<00:02:48.200> plug<00:02:48.440> right

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
right here I think that can plug right

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.500 
right here I think that can plug right
into<00:02:48.830> an<00:02:49.069> iPod<00:02:49.700> or<00:02:50.060> an<00:02:51.049> iPhone<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:52.330> think<00:02:53.330> he's

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
into an iPod or an iPhone I think he's

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.080 
into an iPod or an iPhone I think he's
on<00:02:53.690> your<00:02:53.810> iPhone<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.140> think<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:54.860> is

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
on your iPhone I think this is

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.949 
on your iPhone I think this is
considered<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:57.069> mobile<00:02:58.069> headset<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.569> can<00:02:59.630> plug

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
considered a mobile headset you can plug

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.930 
considered a mobile headset you can plug
it<00:03:00.049> in<00:03:00.110> right<00:03:00.140> there<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.519> back<00:03:01.700> of<00:03:01.850> the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
it in right there in the back of the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.590 
it in right there in the back of the
computer<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.950> breaks<00:03:04.430> off<00:03:04.730> really<00:03:05.180> can't<00:03:05.420> see

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
computer it breaks off really can't see

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.479 
computer it breaks off really can't see
it<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:05.780> well<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.380> is<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.709> mic<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.100> can<00:03:07.220> see

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
it that well this is the mic you can see

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.000 
it that well this is the mic you can see
the<00:03:07.640> green<00:03:07.910> that's<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.780> mic<00:03:08.989> function<00:03:09.709> or

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
the green that's the mic function or

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.880 
the green that's the mic function or
feature<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.480> other<00:03:11.630> ones<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.080> headset

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
feature and the other ones the headset

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.370 
feature and the other ones the headset
so<00:03:13.190> it's<00:03:13.850> just<00:03:14.420> like<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.720> other<00:03:14.870> one<00:03:14.989> here

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
so it's just like the other one here

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.930 
so it's just like the other one here
I'll<00:03:15.530> show<00:03:15.799> you<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:18.190> that's<00:03:19.190> how<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.459> Z<00:03:19.670> 2's

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
I'll show you the that's how the Z 2's

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.620 
I'll show you the that's how the Z 2's
were<00:03:20.239> same<00:03:21.170> exact<00:03:21.500> thing<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:21.769> was<00:03:22.630> the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
were same exact thing that was the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.530 
were same exact thing that was the
bottom<00:03:23.810> part<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.530> those<00:03:25.489> are<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.820> two

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
bottom part of it and those are the two

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.949 
bottom part of it and those are the two
cables<00:03:26.870> it's<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.500> same<00:03:27.799> exact<00:03:28.359> no<00:03:29.359> different

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
cables it's the same exact no different

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.280 
cables it's the same exact no different
on<00:03:30.079> the<00:03:30.530> z2<00:03:31.370> s<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:32.000> overall<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.780> would<00:03:32.840> say<00:03:32.989> it's

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
on the z2 s so overall I would say it's

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.289 
on the z2 s so overall I would say it's
definitely<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.980> great<00:03:34.400> headset<00:03:34.910> for<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.090> price

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
definitely a great headset for the price

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.330 
definitely a great headset for the price
