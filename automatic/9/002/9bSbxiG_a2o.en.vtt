there's back and grabbed that's uh it's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.610 
there's back and grabbed that's uh it's
just<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.260> most<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.800> d5<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.219> years<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
just like most to d5 in years and the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.190 
just like most to d5 in years and the
thing<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.860> these<00:00:41.370> two<00:00:41.579> graphs<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.840> exact

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
thing is these two graphs have the exact

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.779 
thing is these two graphs have the exact
same<00:00:43.440> animation<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.280> can't<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.640> tell

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
same animation you can't really tell

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.040 
same animation you can't really tell
what's<00:00:44.969> coming<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.360> that's<00:00:45.930> actually

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
what's coming and that's actually

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.720 
what's coming and that's actually
important<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.770> note<00:00:46.950> between<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.370> two<00:00:47.489> grabs

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
important to note between the two grabs

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.990 
important to note between the two grabs
because<00:00:48.020> to<00:00:49.020> break<00:00:49.289> them<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.800> actually<00:00:50.219> need

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
because to break them you actually need

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.029 
because to break them you actually need
it's<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.300> 50-50<00:00:51.899> between<00:00:51.989> them<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.500> Alvin<00:00:52.800> hit

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it's a 50-50 between them so Alvin hit

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.299

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the thing is this because there's no

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
the thing is this because there's no
different<00:01:28.799> animation<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.000> complete

sides<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.310> something<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.000> try

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
sides or something like that you can try

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.819 
sides or something like that you can try
to<00:01:54.149> read<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.570> now<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:56.990> know<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> guess<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
to read that now I know it's a guess and

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.010 
to read that now I know it's a guess and
that's<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.189> oh<00:01:59.369> well<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.149> case<00:02:00.360> fifty

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that's like oh well in that case fifty

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.149 
that's like oh well in that case fifty
percent<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.380> graphs<00:02:01.560> are<00:02:01.680> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> land<00:02:02.040> on

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
percent of graphs are going to land on

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.310 
percent of graphs are going to land on
me<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.490> then<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:03.270> there<00:02:03.659> are<00:02:03.750> ways<00:02:03.840> around<00:02:03.899> it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
me and then but there are ways around it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.660 
me and then but there are ways around it
so<00:02:04.649> um<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.700> duck<00:02:06.000> here<00:02:06.180> i'll<00:02:06.390> try<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.899> grab<00:02:07.110> me

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
so um if I duck here i'll try to grab me

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.190 
so um if I duck here i'll try to grab me
so<00:02:08.670> you'll<00:02:08.910> notice<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.209> when<00:02:09.599> Alvin<00:02:09.869> goes<00:02:10.050> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
so you'll notice that when Alvin goes to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.630 
so you'll notice that when Alvin goes to
grab<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.560> goes<00:02:10.709> right<00:02:10.920> over<00:02:10.950> my<00:02:11.190> head
