00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.969
 hello friends who follow my channel 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.190
 they know that I recently made a knife from spring 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.529
 so finally I tortured him why 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.359
 before tormented because suitable 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.850
 I have no knife tool 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.939
 practically on the knee would be amber all 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.849
 It was probably a lot easier for the day 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.340
 or two would make a knife for 2 pm 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.590
 but since but I have no tools 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.600
 it was for him that was my time 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.160
 more well everyone does this for the first time 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.649
 in principle, for the results pleased 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.510
 let's not pull the cat by the tail a 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.379
 I'll do a quick review right away 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.829
 Immediately I warn not surveyor so 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.770
 measure approximately let's look at 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.280
 generally go means such need 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.940
 temporary option 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.539
 then I plan to do from 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.579
 automobile liner 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.670
 who does not know how to do go to the channel 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.400
 samopal cube they are there all detailed 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.520
 tells shows either go for no 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.490
 find liner that want to make leather 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.470
 need but again on find skin in general 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.860
 all this then let's see what 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.860
 happened 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.340
 I am very pleased with the form 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.710
 the first knife was perfect for me 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.750
 it's perfect because they usually say 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.100
 first fucking lump 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:43.740
 but my first pancake was delicious 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.330
 let's measure the size overall length i 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.229
 I will call approximate numbers 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.020
 because exactly 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.440
 let no one really want to measure 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.380
 long reluctantly that the total length of 24 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.410
 centimeter length Kremlin 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.410
 the cutting part of the blade 12 and a half 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.970
 stick length 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.250
 one and a half 12 cm again I repeat 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.019
 do not judge approximate figures 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.570
 strictly 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.430
 butt thickness of 3 millimeters means 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.709
 the thickness of the butt here is thicker from 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.519
 hilt and all thinner and thinner and thinner and 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.980
 thinner but still a fat butt for 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.750
 products are not particularly suitable because I 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.239
 I tried to cut the potatoes then the potatoes 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.130
 it does not hurt aru byte window pressured to 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:43.260
 potato and it cracks and descents from 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:45.180
 Butt made such a lens I do not know 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.780
 You can see it or not 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.780
 to show 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.410
 It looks like the handle The handle is made 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.500
 of 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:08.050
 kitchen cutting board bought for 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:10.940
 20 I will help this on the axis in slippery conditions 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.830
 okay so I am but at the same time 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.500
 has the feeling like on 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.750
 rubberized still noticed noticed 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.560
 wet then it gets even more 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.110
 the Church as well as why one can not even 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.170
 I will say wearing eyelets made with 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.480
 aluminum tube excavated digging 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.340
 with the help of let's look for the usual screw 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.980
 old cut off screw cap with one 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.739
 old on the other hand design clamp 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:50.480
 either vise or my case I clamped 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:54.620
 as well as a clamp and then a hammer here 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:59.209
 yes black we get pretty 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.110
 all true lies perfectly in hand 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.970
 least in my 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.320
 because I have customized everything 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.860
 now try to make some 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.860
 tests 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.130
 someone I do not remember asking why 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.470
 spring spring from the car is clear the same 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.460
 but what I will not say because 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:30.950
 wagon I got another for the sake of my 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:37.950
 I did not know, in principle, everything 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:38.970
 especially nothing to tell the next knife 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.840
 I will have even more interesting 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:46.260
 material so watch the channel 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.670
