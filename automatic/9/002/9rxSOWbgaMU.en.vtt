00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.980
 it seemed personally that it was not so easy 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.049
 discoveries come out as if everything is very simple 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.129

 I am more than sure that you will find 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.240
 interesting and useful valuable information 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.479

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.520

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.670
 let's start unpacking ours already 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.680
 by reference under the name already understood that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.479
 is in this parcel ordered this 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.090
 telephone number on 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.060
 like it was 12 days of electronics or how 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.450
 it was called that is by very good 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.700
 price and very good that the first order 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.540
 nemo of this smartphone I canceled 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.560
 And it turned out to take this device let's say 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.829
 such an old lady skidochka 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.060
 it means we have elephone p7 here 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.539
 bought in from google seller and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.250
 a reference to the seller put under the video 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.110
 that the seller principle is never by 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.460
 other good seller can be good 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.619
 buy the more that you see here 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:09.580
 the best pack which 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:13.090
 protects on spider damage on 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.160
 charger straight apart so 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.310
 That we have here on charging, charging, we have 5 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.140
 volts as much as 2 amps 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.330
 a little so impressive though 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.410
 a little bit such a scale so to speak 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.430
 and so what we have inside that is this 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:37.180
 box phone t5200d jetsam cell 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:40.360
 phone gps Wi-Fi 3g so open there 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.430
 contact packaging of course thick cardboard 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.580
 and it makes no sense to point out because 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.769
 that I think you are not interested 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.810
 It means so the chip of the smartphone in what the chip 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.820
 smartphone is that we have it 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.850
 batteries by as many as five thousand 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:02.680
 three hundred milliamps which we have 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:04.959
 there is 5350 that's so fucking stupid 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.730
 This is a battery of 5 thousand 350 milliamps 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.200
 if in fact the battery capacity 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.569
 the stated battery capacity seems 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.489
 right then it will be very cool learn 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.139
 we have two sim cards we have a slot 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.660
 for micro sd card to expands 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.670
 16 gigabyte internal memory 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.650
 also with a hole fold that is 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.019
 reset the phone if it is frozen as 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.850
 I do n’t eat the battery , although I don’t know 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.120
 why it is necessary because you can, in principle, and 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.299
 long press 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.239
 power buttons turn it off so it's on 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:37.170
 We remove a piece so that it does not bother us 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.830
 glue it somewhere 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:47.010
 so well, and we start the device look 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:51.239
 that there the masses how we get there 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.890
 let us start the cover matte such 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.810
 plastic is actually honestly by 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.329
 when I watched the video thought it would be worse and 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.670
 there is such a very good 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.970
 lid means we have in the kit 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.620
 except for the charger I 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.640
 charger gave us here 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.829
 such an adapter we also have 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.959
 micro usb usb cable 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.890
 so here we have additional 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.049
 protective film 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.630
 that is, if it wears it out for sure 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.780
 all instructions will wear out more than that 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.610
 us set to the cabinet 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.410
 so the set we remove at night is interesting 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.139
 then we are more interested in the apparatus 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.990
 so what can I say that is 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.630
 device 2 gigabytes of RAM 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.970
 16 gigabytes of integrated play market on 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.880
 board camera is already present 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.490
 13 or 16 megapixel camera for sure 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.460
 I don't remember, but from what I see, it seems like 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.440
 would be naked android that basically for 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:56.910
 many users will be positive and 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:00.919
 KAMAZ full hd 1920 at 1080 points only 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:06.590
 I can not understand faded or not faded shorter 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:11.880
 check so we have a camera about 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:18.380
 camera settings 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:21.449
 the camera is even 16 megapixels otlichnenko 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.919
 I do not remember the excellent front camera 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.280
 to be honest, now principle 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.620
 look frontal inter and as many as 8 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.690
 megapixels are stunned but chip 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.530
 smartphone is that here in this button 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.740
 mechanical 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.729
 and we built a wardrobe here 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.439
 fingerprint scanner on 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:43.219
 It is as if the smartphones of the foot function 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:44.689
 I have not yet been so see the first 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.460
 impression apparatus in principle 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:48.969
 felt that weighty that is 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.199
 maybe the battery there really is 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:53.029
 approaches those values ​​that were 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.860
 shown we will check it all 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.569
 test it because it's only a video 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.889
 unpacking will be video also with full 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:04.759
 detailed reviews of interesting and scanner 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:08.240
 super fingerprint consists of 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:11.050
 boxes I understand that the peel is a tyrant 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.279
 even fingerprint scanner 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.789
 calibration well for now we won't 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:20.809
 do that is we will do it all in 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:22.580
 process well dad by design that is here 

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:24.770
 This is certainly not floating sense 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.509
 non-thomas plastic though looks 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.300
 not bad plastic is not much 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:32.300
 shiny frosted buttons buttons 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:36.439
 the buttons are kind of like plastic too 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:39.559
 there are non-metallic in thickness it is so 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:41.899
 pretty fat say well no wonder 

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:48.759
 the fact that the battery is supposed to be 

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:48.759
 5,000 mAh, let's focus 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:57.660
 but in general, that is a hole in Ukhta husband 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.540
 us here seven whole two dynamics if 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.330
 two speakers will be generally very much 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.370
 well she doesn't even have everything 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.850
 we have black vultures this is what up pins 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.980
 that the lecturer should not have seen the contact 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.410
 attention yes we have an antenna and at all 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.150
 here we have contacts 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:18.720
 Well, in short, that is, a smartphone for a very 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:21.090
 interesting price if the battery is in 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.620
 limits as if those numbers which 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.270
 declared by the manufacturer then it will be on 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.700
 really very cool and a pro will 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.680
 standing processor at the smartphone 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.990
 eight-core is not the coolest not the most 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.120
 new not 52 92 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.050
 but still , he is still 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.570
 remains relevant for 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.640
 performance but still on it 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.480
 the video will end it was a video 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.550
 unpacking 

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.860
 will be separately video testing 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.480
 full full review in which i 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.310
 I'll tell you everything I learned from this 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.630
 device, that is, its pros and cons and 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.400
 whether from real match 

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.830
 characteristics all indicators that 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.140
 manufacturers were still listed on 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.900
 this i say goodbye to everyone thank you very much for 

00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.530
