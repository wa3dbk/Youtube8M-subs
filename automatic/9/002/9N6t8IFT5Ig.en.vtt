00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.830
 the strangest animal prostheses 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.960
 vampirella 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.910
 not long ago when an animal 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.940
 I lost a limb I ended up dying 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.580
 in recent years the development of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.489
 artificial prostheses in animals from 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.070
 fins until spikes or legs have given 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.220
 life expectancy to a lot of 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.620
 injured animals today I bring you the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.620
 strangest animal prostheses 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.379
 touch the turtle on wheels 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.120
 tonka a turtle bay area lost the 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.820
 mobility after your legs 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.320
 they were bitten by a dog so they 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.470
 the workers of the society 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.860
 peninsula or manÃ© they managed to implant 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.740
 wheels so he could move 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.320
 tonka was adapted almost immediately an 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.120
 couple of days after the given operation 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.120
 the media repercussion that had 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.610
 a crocodile with a tail prosthesis 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.860
 Mr. stops lost his tail for another 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.140
 crocodile in the back of a 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.880
 truck that was transporting illegally to 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.100
 the reptiles 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.259
 Inspired by the story of a dolphin 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.560
 who learned to use a prosthetic tail 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.840
 the research team advanced on 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.729
 the construction of what they believe is 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.350
 the first prosthetic tail for a 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.009
 crocodile 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.189
 the crocodiles live up to 60 years and 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.840
 mister stops will need around 40 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.840
 new larger prostheses 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.860
 bolt and the horse with a prosthetic 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860
 paw 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.530
 molly is a mottled gray horse that was 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.530
 abandoned by its owners when 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.510
 hurricane katrina hit south 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.360
 Louisiana 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.569
 Molly spent weeks in her own root 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.640
 of the catastrophe before finally being 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.329
 rescued and taken to a farm where 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.579
 the abandoned animals were stored 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:45.130
 once there he was attacked by a pit bull 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.830
 terrier and almost died 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.070
 his right front leg was 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.740
 terribly damaged and the 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.230
 veterinarian agreed to remove the leg 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.530
 below the knee and put a 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.510
 moli temporary artificial limb 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.940
 He left the clinic by his own 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.430
 means and now it's a source of 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.120
 inspiration for children and horses 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.120
 all the world 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.350
 motta the elephant with a leg of 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.350
 wood 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.470
 motta the elephant stepped on a mine 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.520
 land near the border between 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.590
 thailand and burma in 1999 the 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.990
 veterinarians were able to repair 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.900
 his front leg but he stayed a lot 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.820
 shorter than the others in the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.550
 asian elephant hospital in 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.240
 thailand motala started using a 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.030
 orthopedic leg in 2005 the prosthesis is 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.070
 a bag full of wood shavings 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.170
 she accepted perfectly and is 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.170
 doing normal life nowadays 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.850
 fuji the dolphin with a rubber tail 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.970
 for decades the dolphin fungir 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.489
 delighted the children who visited the 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.400
 okinawa aquarium until one 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.760
 mysterious disease began eating 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.060
 its caudal fin to save its life almost 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.520
 his entire tail had to be amputated 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.370
 the tail fin of a dolphin is a 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.070
 motor without it the dolphins can not 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.650
 swim jump diving so the 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.169
 bridgestone engineers had to 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.930
 work to design a new queue of 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.240
 rubber to fungir 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.520
 the first designs did not work 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.449
 correctly or had one or another 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.599
 disadvantage 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.729
 funge I accept the third design of the tail 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.879
 Made of silicone rubber with a 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:55.339
 Foam filler was also able to 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.339
 swim almost also like a normal dolphin 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.170
 the dog with leg prostheses was born 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.979
 abandoned in the brutal winter of 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.169
 Nebraska his legs and his tail 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.919
 frozen without there being any way 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.319
 save them since then their owner tried 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.780
 of getting these prostheses part of the 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:23.460
 which were financed by ortho pets 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:26.449
 with moved by history 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.449
 Thank you 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.260
 do not
