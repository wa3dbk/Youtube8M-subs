00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
connect Europe bagheera head to the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.030 
connect Europe bagheera head to the
speaker<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.509> Marshall<00:00:12.960> combo<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.980> I'm

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
speaker and the Marshall combo so I'm

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.230 
speaker and the Marshall combo so I'm
going<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.219> show<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.400> how<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.580> do<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:14.969> right

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
going to show you how to do that right

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.700 
going to show you how to do that right
now<00:00:15.269> I'll<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:15.719> turn<00:00:15.990> these<00:00:16.199> around<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.560> you

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
now I'll just turn these around so you

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.230 
now I'll just turn these around so you
can<00:00:16.830> see<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.039> back<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.369> them<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.609> actually

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
can see the back of them and actually

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.960 
can see the back of them and actually
the<00:00:18.750> secret<00:00:19.160> so<00:00:20.160> here<00:00:20.310> look<00:00:20.460> at<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> back<00:00:20.730> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
the secret so here look at the back of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.609 
the secret so here look at the back of
the<00:00:21.090> Bagheera<00:00:21.359> head<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.900> at<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> Marshall

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the Bagheera head and at the Marshall

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.710 
the Bagheera head and at the Marshall
combo<00:00:23.160> now<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> combo<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.330> has<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> head

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
combo now the combo is that has a head

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.589 
combo now the combo is that has a head
part<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:26.189> cab<00:00:26.400> part<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.000> they're

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
part and the cab part and they're

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.470 
part and the cab part and they're
connected<00:00:28.109> by<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.650> cable<00:00:29.070> here<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.179> can

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
connected by this cable here so I can

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.120 
connected by this cable here so I can
pull<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.810> out<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.410> quarter<00:00:31.710> jack

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
pull that out and it's a quarter jack

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.770 
pull that out and it's a quarter jack
that's<00:00:32.460> connected<00:00:33.090> directly<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> speaker

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that's connected directly to the speaker

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.810 
that's connected directly to the speaker
so<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> bet<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.309> want<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> get

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
so this is the bet that I want to get

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.150 
so this is the bet that I want to get
into<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.540> amp<00:00:36.750> here<00:00:37.050> now<00:00:37.500> obviously<00:00:37.980> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
into the amp here now obviously that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.220 
into the amp here now obviously that
cable<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.730> short<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.270> designed<00:00:39.570> only<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.050> go

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
cable is short and designed only to go

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.650 
cable is short and designed only to go
to<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.300> reach<00:00:42.450> up

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
to here so it's not going to reach up

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.590 
to here so it's not going to reach up
and<00:00:42.809> get<00:00:43.020> into<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.469> amp<00:00:43.710> however<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:45.300> is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
and get into that amp however this is

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.110 
and get into that amp however this is
the<00:00:46.110> secret<00:00:46.379> level<00:00:46.590> piece<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.489> need<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the secret level piece that you need to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.450 
the secret level piece that you need to
get<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.570> work<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.320> our<00:00:49.680> female

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
get that to work this is our female

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.630 
get that to work this is our female
female<00:00:51.059> quarter<00:00:51.809> jack<00:00:52.050> coupler<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.460> can

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
that's coming from the speaker and the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.080 
that's coming from the speaker and the
combo<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.300> click<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:59.640> then<00:00:59.879> you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
combo and click that in and then you

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.979 
combo and click that in and then you
take<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.570> speaker<00:01:01.199> cable<00:01:02.000> aqua<00:01:03.000> end<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.750> then

take a speaker cable aqua end and then

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.960 
take a speaker cable aqua end and then
you've<00:01:04.199> got<00:01:04.409> there<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> length<00:01:05.760> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
you've got there have got a length that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.090 
you've got there have got a length that
we<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.210> split<00:01:06.420> into<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.560> legs<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.950> could

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
we can split into the legs you could

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.789 
we can split into the legs you could
Jack<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.240> armpit<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:11.040> how<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
Jack on the armpit so that's how I do it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.010 
Jack on the armpit so that's how I do it
so<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.250> bypasses<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.150> head<00:01:15.299> entirely<00:01:15.689> don't

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
so just bypasses the head entirely don't

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.660 
so just bypasses the head entirely don't
have<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.290> paired<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.340> use<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
have that paired up and just use the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.270 
have that paired up and just use the
speaker<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.659> cabinet<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.530> F<00:01:19.860> like

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
speaker as if it's a cabinet so F like

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.039 
speaker as if it's a cabinet so F like
me<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.850> were<00:01:20.939> running<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.270> combo<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> while

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
me you were running a combo for a while

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.020 
me you were running a combo for a while
and<00:01:22.320> then<00:01:22.560> go<00:01:22.590> ahead<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.250> didn't<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
and then go ahead and didn't have a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.370 
and then go ahead and didn't have a
separate<00:01:24.390> cabinet<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.869> wanted<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> use<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
separate cabinet and wanted to use the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.910 
separate cabinet and wanted to use the
speaker<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.670> combo<00:01:27.540> as<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:28.290> your<00:01:28.530> cabinet

then you can just get one of these

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.130 
then you can just get one of these
