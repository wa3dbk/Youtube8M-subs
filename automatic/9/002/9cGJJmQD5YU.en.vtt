that's not the only you know there's
other<00:01:04.350> studios<00:01:05.630> like<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.720> said<00:01:06.930> they're<00:01:07.049> being

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
other studios like I said they're being

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.020 
other studios like I said they're being
combined<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.740> really<00:01:07.979> Emeryville<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.790> mean

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
combined in really Emeryville I mean

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.760 
combined in really Emeryville I mean
that's<00:01:09.210> symbolic<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.960> cut<00:01:10.170> off<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.470> head<00:01:10.500> in

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that's symbolic you cut off the head in

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.750 
that's symbolic you cut off the head in
the<00:01:10.860> body<00:01:11.070> dies<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.320> I<00:01:13.369> think<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.520> really

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the body dies and I think it's really

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
the body dies and I think it's really
really<00:01:15.509> gross<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:16.020> did<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.290> during<00:01:16.439> GDC

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
really gross that they did it during GDC

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.840 
really gross that they did it during GDC
to<00:01:17.310> try<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> avoid<00:01:18.530> press<00:01:19.610> because<00:01:20.610> that's

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
to try to avoid press because that's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.039 
to try to avoid press because that's
exactly<00:01:21.270> why<00:01:21.390> they<00:01:21.540> would<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.689> done<00:01:21.900> it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
exactly why they would have done it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.010 
exactly why they would have done it
during<00:01:22.140> GDC<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.950> pax<00:01:23.640> week<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.360> avoid<00:01:24.750> any

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.289 
SimCity's they're you know what a
SimCity<00:03:28.920> games<00:03:29.160> going<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.400> look<00:03:29.579> like<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.060> would

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
SimCity games going to look like I would

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.970 
SimCity games going to look like I would
say<00:03:30.450> that's<00:03:30.660> sadly<00:03:30.900> true<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.500> most<00:03:31.709> part

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
say that's sadly true for the most part

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.710 
say that's sadly true for the most part
because<00:03:32.130> I've<00:03:32.370> done<00:03:32.579> so<00:03:32.760> many<00:03:32.850> sim<00:03:33.209> games<00:03:33.450> you

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
because I've done so many sim games you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.990 
because I've done so many sim games you
know<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.079> copy-and-paste<00:03:34.500> idea<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.310> easy<00:03:35.579> but

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
know the copy-and-paste idea is easy but

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.789 
know the copy-and-paste idea is easy but
once<00:03:36.690> again<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.500> last<00:03:37.709> SimCity<00:03:39.799> was

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
once again the last SimCity was

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.770 
once again the last SimCity was
miserable<00:03:41.220> but<00:03:41.549> most<00:03:41.790> people's<00:03:42.120> accounts<00:03:42.540> so

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
miserable but most people's accounts so

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.629 
miserable but most people's accounts so
just<00:03:43.230> because<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.680> framework<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.250> previous

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
just because the framework of previous

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.220 
just because the framework of previous
successes<00:03:45.030> there<00:03:45.329> doesn't<00:03:45.630> mean<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.959> greed

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
successes there doesn't mean that greed

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.609 
successes there doesn't mean that greed
can't<00:03:46.530> get<00:03:46.769> in<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:46.980> way<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.250> ruin<00:03:47.519> it
