00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 the first manufacturer to bring an exchange 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.639
 automated for Brazil was the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.980
 chevrolet with your line and zie tronic 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.250
 I remember the meriva engine 1.8 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.789
 putting isi tronic was a whole exchange rate 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.410
 done by luck and gave a lot of trouble 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.480
 this exchange 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.449
 many owners of these cars that took 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.580
 automated exchange and put 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.310
 a manual exchange in place of so many 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.040
 problems that should remain soon after 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.559
 came to fiat and volkswagen already at once 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.309
 with your blogs with your logical dua that 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.940
 go girl né that was a different exchange 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:46.920
 were exchanges is in partnership with magneti 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.340
 marelli e cissé 0 - defects but also 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.559
 had many defects and there were 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.719
 being perfected with the passing of the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.960
 time gaining more management 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.329
 improved 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.039
 finally being improved with the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.619
 passing the time today the daughter calls 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.270
 doha fuzzy logic model it and 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.840
 volkswagen continues to call 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.030
 I like her models but what 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.820
 happened there even though these fields 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.770
 changes with many defects is 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.909
 that was gaining public was winning 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.180
 customers 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.360
 it was gaining market so it's the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.220
 competing brands 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.689
 saw that there is then room for 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.700
 they win right? 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.460
 it is public that everyone is 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.299
 developing their exchange rates 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.630
 automated 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.340
 the most recent is now that it will launch in the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.970
 market an automated exchange rate is the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.159
 in your logan and sandero modes will see 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.890
 only on the 1.6 engine will it 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.930
 automated exchange rate is the same 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.630
 five-speed renoir long exchange 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.579
 only now it comes automated as 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.680
 renan has not yet officially launched this 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.259
 was printed so it does not have the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.899
 people know who is the manufacturer behind 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.479
 automation of sicán then becomes 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.790
 this question who did the automation 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.459
 of this exchange was magneti marelli as 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.190
 in the case of logical lunch and dodô is the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.020
 look like it was in the case of the former is 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.560
 electronics and chevrolet 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.200
 We do not know yet right oo lunch more 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.600
 recent volkswagen that of anp 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.860
 it is made by porsche and partnership 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.240
 almost efective 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.560
 only it comes from germany 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.710
 then it is also a good option this exchange 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.340
 zf partnership with porsche 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.380
 here we can see on the exchange that he 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:46.470
 has this metal cover on top has the 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:48.000
 letters right power &amp; aacute ca gears 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.880
 on the lever, right? 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.160
 has nothing on the button would be s neck 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.500
 a more sporting mode of driving 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.870
 we also do not know if it will be released on 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.210
 engine 1.0 this exchange as volkswagen 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.680
 made in the year that put this exchange engine 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.970
 1.0 was an unprecedented one in segment 1.0 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.650
 an automated exchange 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.200
 but it's a totally new exchange rate 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.250
 fully facing the engine 1.0 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.860
 volkswagen 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.840
 so this has a high cost, right? 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.970
 here in the kingdom I think it will not be lonely 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.880
 1.6 will not even develop a 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.220
 exclusive box with engine 1.0 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.320
 so I think it's going to have to be 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.230
 only one point 61 sr 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.110
 But that's it for who wants to buy 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.150
 an automatic exchange between quotation marks does not 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.280
 more option on the market now renew 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.230
 toss a new one and the willow 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.060
 I do not particularly like the exchange rate 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.490
 automated exchange rates because they 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.440
 not just a clutch and when they 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.260
 the members of that strangle that 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.420
 bump in the hour you pass but then 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.610
 these scandals they are meant to 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.560
 rotate with two clutches 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.570
 except here in Brazil it is for containment of 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.500
 costs in exchange for example the reindeer 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.470
 and it will cost 3 thousand and 600 more you go 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.400
 pay as optional 3,600 more per 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.190
 this exchange 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.500
 the cost containment they take a 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.020
 clutch of the exchange then it gets 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.400
 Cheap is also cheaper at the time of 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.459
 maintenance only has one 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.010
 clutch to change but has the stride 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.730
 There is a bump in the last hour. 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.730
 the right gear 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.710
 so is this more a manufacturer if 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.030
 yielding to the automated changes here 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.070
 in Brazil, right? 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.500
 I like most of automatic gearbox 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.169
 true with torque converter, right? 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:39.979
 such as the Chevrolet in the onyx 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:42.490
 onyx and prism 1.6 and 1.6 not 1.4 think 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.889
 that already has will be that has in the 4 point has 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.870
 six gearshift gears 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.590
 real automatic with converter 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.570
 torque 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.030
 then in this segment the chevrolet in 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.770
 my opinion is that it took the series more 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.080
 she actually put an exchange 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.260
 Automatic line in Onyx 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.539
 then this is an exchange really that 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.340
 is automatic these automated are 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.229
 manual changes only you do not have the 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.600
 clutch pedal controls a 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.710
 controlled by the central golzinho 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.330
 electronics 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.800
 That's why it gives so much trouble. 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.240
 That's it, then. 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.099
 for who was expecting a choice of 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.099
 automatic gearbox on the market has more 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.800
 two logan and sandero models then 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:28.010
 Let's hope reno officially launches 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.050
 camera to know who the manufacturer is 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.260
 so let's go to the next video 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.260
 folks
