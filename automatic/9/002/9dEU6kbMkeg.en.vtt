00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
different from from bouys Belle you know

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.360 
different from from bouys Belle you know
is<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:14.610> daughter<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.470> not<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> first-time<00:01:17.100> mom

is the daughter to not a first-time mom

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.800 
is the daughter to not a first-time mom
which<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.480> case<00:01:18.690> with<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:20.070> Bowie

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
which is the case with with with Bowie

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.130 
which is the case with with with Bowie
but<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> Belle<00:01:23.430> Belle<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> very<00:01:24.210> outgoing<00:01:24.480> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
but so Belle Belle is very outgoing and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.540 
but so Belle Belle is very outgoing and
also<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.870> pretty<00:01:28.590> reliant<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.220> mom<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
also you know pretty reliant on mom a

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.730 
also you know pretty reliant on mom a
lot<00:01:29.909> more<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.450> than<00:01:30.690> Bowie<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.260> Bowie<00:01:31.470> was

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
lot more so than Bowie when Bowie was

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.610 
lot more so than Bowie when Bowie was
born<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:33.360> know<00:01:33.450> his<00:01:33.659> mother<00:01:34.020> was<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.380> first

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
born you know his mother was the first

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.830 
born you know his mother was the first
it<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> first<00:01:35.310> time<00:01:35.490> she<00:01:35.790> had<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> calf<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it was the first time she had a calf and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.830 
it was the first time she had a calf and
and<00:01:37.610> when<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.729> happens<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.180> lot<00:01:39.300> of<00:01:39.420> times<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and when that happens a lot of times a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.899 
and when that happens a lot of times a
mom<00:01:40.440> really<00:01:40.770> doesn't<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
mom really doesn't know what to do and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.730 
mom really doesn't know what to do and
so<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.390> about<00:01:42.600> five<00:01:42.870> weeks<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.409> had<00:01:43.620> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so for about five weeks we had to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.940 
so for about five weeks we had to
supplement<00:01:43.950> him<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.810> keep<00:01:45.810> her<00:01:45.960> fed<00:01:46.170> milk

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
supplement him with keep her fed milk

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.980 
supplement him with keep her fed milk
and<00:01:47.159> from<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.430> bottle<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.659> took<00:01:48.810> actually

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and from a bottle and it took actually

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.750 
and from a bottle and it took actually
five<00:01:49.409> weeks<00:01:49.680> before<00:01:49.830> he<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.490> started

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
five weeks before he really started

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.710 
five weeks before he really started
nursing<00:01:51.030> completely<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.930> mom<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.560> he<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.720> very

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
nursing completely on mom so he is very

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.780 
nursing completely on mom so he is very
used<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> people<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.830> likes<00:01:56.400> to<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.610> around
