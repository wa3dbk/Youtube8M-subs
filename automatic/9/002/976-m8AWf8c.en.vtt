00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.049
For the first time since it began,
the Afghan National Army has recruited a new

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.519
breed of soldiers for a year of rigorous training
at the new Afghan National Army Officer Academy

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.570
- modelled on the British Royal Military Academy
Sandhurst.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.600
Meet tomorrow's leaders.
Officer Cadet Manaman from Kunduz left his

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.599
job as a radio broadcaster to fight against
the insurgency.

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:25.599
"I came here because my father was also serving
as a soldier until recently, so it was one

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.329
of my dreams to work like my father and serve
my country with honour."

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.340
His brother in arms, Officer Cadet Nazar Mohammed
was already a foot soldier in Uruzgan. His

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.340
motivations were also personal.
"Two of my friends were killed in action in

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.080
a roadside bomb. It really affected me. We
must fight, whether it is with old weapons

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.220
or limited ammunition. We must fight."
But it was Officer Cadet Hajji Mohammed's

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.600
patriotism propelled him forward.
"My dream was to always to serve my people,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.600
and defend the borders of this country. That's
why I decided to become an officer and become

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.810
a good leader."
The new academy on the outskirts of Kabul

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.240
opened its doors in October this year, attracting
over 10,000 applicants. 920 were put through

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.240
their paces through a series of mental and
physical tests. Only 270 made it.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.540
The exams were really hard, especially the
physical test. I didn't think I would make

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.610
it, but tried really hard and, with the help
of God, I passed and here I am today.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.709
"In the beginning they were just civilians,
they didn't know anything or have any discipline

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.709
or know how to march but I see a lot of changes
now and I see them wearing their helmets and

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.010
carrying their rifles in the correct military
manner and this makes me very proud."

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.780
The year-long course will certainly push the
cadets' mental and physical boundaries. But

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.230
Officer Cadet Nazar can see the benefit of
tough training.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.280
"Training is really hard but it is for our
benefit. We are being taught desert tactics,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.930
which is a real challenge and really difficult,
but our instructors keep saying that the more

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.930
you sweat in the training ground the less
you will bleed in the battle."

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.160
And at five weeks into their training, this
first exercise is a real test of their ability

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.160
"We're extremely happy from day one. All their
equipment was issued, they came out quite

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.190
early. They've worked extremely well and adapted
to the environment quite well."

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.670
But the academy is not only creating the future
leaders, it is also uniting the usually divided

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.300
ethnicities of Afghanistan through real nationalism
and pride.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.300
"There are people in this academy from all
over Afghanistan, from every province: north,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.900
south, east, west and this touches my heart.
They all have the national spirit and the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.359
same uniform and the national unity, which
makes me really happy."
