00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
the dirt inside that means that the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.990 
the dirt inside that means that the
gopher<00:00:44.510> has<00:00:44.750> plugged<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:45.260> up<00:00:45.580> and<00:00:46.580> what<00:00:46.790> that

gopher has plugged it up and what that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.910 
gopher has plugged it up and what that
means<00:00:47.330> is<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:48.940> Gophers<00:00:49.940> don't<00:00:50.150> like<00:00:50.920> light

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
means is that Gophers don't like light

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.210 
means is that Gophers don't like light
or<00:00:52.280> any<00:00:53.030> other<00:00:53.240> type<00:00:53.540> of<00:00:53.950> intruder<00:00:54.950> in<00:00:55.070> there

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
so they cover it up with dirt and what

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.800 
so they cover it up with dirt and what
you<00:01:00.080> want<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.380> do<00:01:00.560> is<00:01:00.860> you<00:01:01.100> want<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.370> find<00:01:01.810> the

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
holes with the freshest dirt and the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.340 
holes with the freshest dirt and the
first<00:01:08.690> step<00:01:08.930> is<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:09.440> need<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.620> hose<00:01:09.890> this<00:01:10.550> long

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.740 

so<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.130> can<00:01:15.280> reach<00:01:15.430> every<00:01:15.760> single<00:01:16.180> hole

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
so that you can reach every single hole

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.850 
so that you can reach every single hole
that<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.260> have<00:01:17.380> in<00:01:17.500> your<00:01:17.590> yard<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.590> again

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
that you have in your yard and so again

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.180 
that you have in your yard and so again
what<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:21.070> do<00:01:21.280> is<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.550> turn<00:01:21.729> on<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.970> hose<00:01:22.120> you

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
what you do is you turn on the hose you

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.719 
what you do is you turn on the hose you
stick<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.430> hose<00:01:24.760> in<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:26.020> hole<00:01:26.440> that<00:01:27.310> has<00:01:27.520> been

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
stick the hose in the hole that has been

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.730 
stick the hose in the hole that has been
plugged<00:01:28.000> up<00:01:28.119> not<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.450> open<00:01:28.720> hole<00:01:28.840> but<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.619> one

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
plugged up not the open hole but the one

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.719 
plugged up not the open hole but the one
that<00:01:29.890> has<00:01:29.979> been<00:01:30.130> plugged<00:01:30.340> up

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
that has been plugged up

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.230 
that has been plugged up
chances<00:01:31.510> are<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:33.220> Gopher<00:01:33.850> is<00:01:33.940> going<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.150> be

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
chances are the Gopher is going to be

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.380 
chances are the Gopher is going to be
hiding<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.660> there<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:36.880> are<00:01:37.000> successful

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
hiding in there if you are successful

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.219 
hiding in there if you are successful
the<00:01:38.320> Gopher<00:01:38.680> is<00:01:38.830> going<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.160> be<00:01:39.810> wrapped<00:01:40.810> and

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
the Gopher is going to be wrapped and

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.200 
the Gopher is going to be wrapped and
drowning<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.400> has<00:01:42.550> no<00:01:42.759> other<00:01:42.880> choice<00:01:42.970> than

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
drowning and it has no other choice than

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.139 
drowning and it has no other choice than
to<00:01:43.660> try<00:01:44.650> to<00:01:44.680> escape<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:46.500> earlier<00:01:47.500> today<00:01:48.149> we

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
to try to escape and earlier today we

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.400 
to try to escape and earlier today we
attempted<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.140> catch<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:51.009> gopher<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:52.410> well

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
attempted to catch a gopher and well

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.320 
attempted to catch a gopher and well
were<00:01:53.800> we<00:01:53.950> successful<00:01:54.690> all<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.810> gotta<00:01:56.140> say<00:01:56.200> is

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
were we successful all I gotta say is

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.050 
were we successful all I gotta say is
human<00:01:58.330> one<00:01:59.310> go<00:02:00.310> for<00:02:01.050> zero
