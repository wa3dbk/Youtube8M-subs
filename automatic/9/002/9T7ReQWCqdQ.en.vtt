00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.730
 Geneva 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.730
 okay 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280
 khalid 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:46.280
 you score goals 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.490
 Wow 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:28.990
 rest, put down 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.010
 saliba 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.170
 first 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.880
 start to prepare well for the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.370
 match what an old but that's 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.740
 particular as match is so the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.330
 world has prepared well 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.380
 psychologically and we arrived on 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.530
 the field with the aggressiveness 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.120
 we have conceded goals we have scored we have 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.550
 when we took goals we did not 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.080
 released we did not lower our head and that 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.760
 that's good and in the end we have 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.280
 continued until the end and it paid for 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.200
 win 4-3 it's been days ago 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.209
 like that it's like that you have to have a 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.860
 little success and today I have them 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.900
 have against against metz and then that 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.800
 benefit the team 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.200
 what can still be improved 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.100
 in this team I think falcon 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.660
 we need to play faster 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.250
 defenders middle one gets to 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.590
 find more more circles because 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.109
 today he was really in 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.390
 land available so we do not have 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.519
 managed to find them leave with 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.610
 how could and comment to find 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.870
 adversaries I found that we 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.450
 did we expect a good team 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.090
 already so we came across a good 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.040
 metz team that took us well 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.530
 we had trouble re-launching the 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.090
 balloon and so they knew how to concretize 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.380
 their opportunities they had it was a 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.380
 fairly balanced match
