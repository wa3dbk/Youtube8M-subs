00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
obviously I'm in a key of C here you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:01:00.970 
obviously I'm in a key of C here you
gotta<00:00:46.110> catch<00:00:46.469> that

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.319

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
playing here versus up here and I don't

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.520 
playing here versus up here and I don't
know<00:01:18.690> if<00:01:18.780> you'll<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.990> able<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.259> hear<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
know if you'll be able to hear the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.200 
know if you'll be able to hear the
difference<00:01:19.649> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.190> tone<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.850> there's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
difference of the tone but there there's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300 
difference of the tone but there there's
definitely<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.630> difference<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> tone<00:01:22.409> when

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
definitely a difference in the tone when

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.950 
definitely a difference in the tone when
you<00:01:23.340> play<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:24.060> different<00:01:24.210> strings<00:01:24.690> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
you play on different strings and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.139 
you play on different strings and
different<00:01:25.409> parts<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> neck<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.880> has<00:01:27.030> got

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
different parts of the neck this has got

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.779 
different parts of the neck this has got
a<00:01:27.180> more<00:01:27.420> tighter<00:01:27.750> brighter<00:01:28.110> sound<00:01:28.580> this<00:01:29.580> gets

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
a more tighter brighter sound this gets

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.440 
a more tighter brighter sound this gets
a<00:01:29.850> little<00:01:30.000> little<00:01:30.720> muddier

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.450 

now<00:01:36.049> even<00:01:36.259> though<00:01:36.409> that<00:01:36.650> actually<00:01:37.189> sounded

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
now even though that actually sounded

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.280 
now even though that actually sounded
more<00:01:37.580> like<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.880> record<00:01:38.150> cuz<00:01:38.330> Brits<00:01:38.659> doing<00:01:39.200> a

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
more like the record cuz Brits doing a

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.630 
more like the record cuz Brits doing a
dead<00:01:39.530> thumb<00:01:39.799> here<00:01:44.140> so<00:01:45.189> this<00:01:46.189> is<00:01:46.310> probably

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
dead thumb here so this is probably

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.090 
dead thumb here so this is probably
where<00:01:46.820> he's<00:01:46.909> playing<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.540> just<00:01:47.979> sounds<00:01:48.979> a

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
where he's playing and it just sounds a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.149 
where he's playing and it just sounds a
little<00:01:49.310> tighter<00:01:49.670> brighter<00:01:50.090> than<00:01:51.039> he<00:01:52.039> might

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
little tighter brighter than he might

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.320 
little tighter brighter than he might
like<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:52.700> down<00:01:52.880> here

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.920 

let<00:01:56.330> me<00:01:56.450> break<00:01:56.600> that<00:01:56.659> down<00:01:56.810> uh<00:01:58.659> being<00:01:59.659> it<00:01:59.780> so

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
let me break that down uh being it so

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:16.610 
let me break that down uh being it so
good<00:02:00.289> up<00:02:00.380> here<00:02:00.409> I'll<00:02:00.619> I'll<00:02:00.770> play<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.070> up<00:02:01.159> here

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.240 

that<00:02:17.620> would<00:02:17.770> be<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.610> intro<00:02:20.010> there<00:02:21.010> again

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
that would be the the intro there again

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.310 
that would be the the intro there again
like<00:02:21.400> say<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.580> played<00:02:21.880> them<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:26.080> what<00:02:26.230> I'm

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
like say I played them and what I'm

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.740 
like say I played them and what I'm
doing<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.880> that's<00:02:27.970> why<00:02:28.180> I'm<00:02:28.300> thinking<00:02:28.420> Brett

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
doing and that's why I'm thinking Brett

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.810 
doing and that's why I'm thinking Brett
plays<00:02:28.990> it<00:02:29.200> down<00:02:29.320> here<00:02:29.620> cuz<00:02:30.340> he's<00:02:30.490> kicked<00:02:30.700> this

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
plays it down here cuz he's kicked this

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.540 
plays it down here cuz he's kicked this
this<00:02:31.510> slide<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:33.640> yet<00:02:33.820> he's<00:02:35.160> he's<00:02:36.160> catching

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
this slide but yet he's he's catching

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.250 
this slide but yet he's he's catching
this<00:02:36.670> root<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.450> I'm<00:02:37.570> almost<00:02:37.810> thinking<00:02:37.990> he's

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
this root so I'm almost thinking he's

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.380 
this root so I'm almost thinking he's
borrowing<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:39.040> g-string<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.820> top<00:02:40.120> as<00:02:40.360> well

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
borrowing that g-string on top as well

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:51.900 
borrowing that g-string on top as well
and<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:42.370> hitting<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.180> life<00:02:50.910> and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
and just hitting that in this life and

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.510 
and just hitting that in this life and
that's<00:02:52.090> looking<00:02:52.810> at<00:02:53.020> that<00:02:53.200> when<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.950> do<00:02:54.310> come

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
that's looking at that when you do come

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.970 
that's looking at that when you do come
up<00:02:54.550> here<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.750> know<00:02:55.810> I'm<00:02:55.900> just<00:02:56.080> playing<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.800> bar

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
up here you know I'm just playing a bar

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:05.130 
up here you know I'm just playing a bar
see<00:02:59.160> look<00:03:00.160> at<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:00.310> as<00:03:00.520> an<00:03:00.640> F<00:03:00.760> chord<00:03:03.959> only<00:03:04.959> he's

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
see look at that as an F chord only he's

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:14.190 
see look at that as an F chord only he's
