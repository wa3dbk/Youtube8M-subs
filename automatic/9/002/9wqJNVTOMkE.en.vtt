 book is from the author of the language and is 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.680
 alone with enough for me to die 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.990
 of desire to read is also all 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.760
 boisei lópez please for jane and jan this 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.890

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.540
 has since I saw the book I knew that 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.390
 I had to read everything in the bad bring 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.009
 from the story to the cover they will say 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.320
 which is mainz by alexandre work that 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.959

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.690
 my industrial friend gave it to me to win 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.730
 and it is not to tell me how good it is and 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.380
 wake up by back babies that I carry 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.239
 a few months wanting to read it and 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.190
 I just do not know why I have not done it 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.950
 and those were the top 5 books that 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.690

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.489

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.280
