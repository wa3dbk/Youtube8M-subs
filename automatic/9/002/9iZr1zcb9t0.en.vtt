 Hello this video recording test 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.349
 new iphone 6 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.049
 let me remind you that the company apple for some 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.670
 unknown reason 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:19.550
 significantly cheated this smartphone 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.660
 optical stabilization in contrast 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.199
 there is no larger sibling iPhone 6 plus 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.929
 that is, there is stabilization here but it 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.759
 at the expense of software 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.750
 let's see how it will be 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.410
 practice video while walking 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.410
 I am coming now 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.060
 in any case, it is already clear that this will be 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:56.090
 worse than optical stabilization 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:58.930
 in iphone 6 plus i'm actually long 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.650
 I thought what kind of iphone 6 should I buy 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.900
 because on the one hand 4 7 inches and 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.880
 dimensions already quite suit me 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.680
 have this screen 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:16.160
 which can use iphone 6 plus 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.570
 you do get a pretty big tube and there 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.740
 will already need to go to some 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.320
 trade-off between screen size and its 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.880
 overall dimensions but since optical 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.400
 stabilization in this camera there is no choice 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.750
 turned out pretty obvious let's 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.750
 let's see how autofocus works 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:46.370
 this is really a wonderful thing on 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.370
 iPhones are better than autofocus never seen 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.800
 it works very quickly and smoothly 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.100
 just gorgeous 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.940
 and then again i'm also fine 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.450
 I understand that for most people 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.600
 optical stabilization which let 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.390
 even won a little soft 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.330
 I think that it will be critical therefore 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.630
 in any case as far as the camera is concerned 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:23.170
 iPhone 6 one of the best camcorders 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:27.210
 without a doubt on it all thank you 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.210
 for the attention of all bye bye
