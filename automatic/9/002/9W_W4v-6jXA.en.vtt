I<00:00:07.380> like<00:00:08.380> to<00:00:08.500> think<00:00:08.679> about<00:00:08.860> engineering

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
I like to think about engineering

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.759 
I like to think about engineering
primarily<00:00:10.240> as<00:00:10.480> being<00:00:11.019> intrinsic<00:00:11.350> to<00:00:11.650> human

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
primarily as being intrinsic to human

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
locations where they are this has to be

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.079 
locations where they are this has to be
a<00:01:02.410> local<00:01:02.649> solution<00:01:03.040> it<00:01:03.280> has<00:01:03.399> a<00:01:03.430> global<00:01:03.670> impact

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
a local solution it has a global impact

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.580 
a local solution it has a global impact
because<00:01:04.629> if<00:01:04.839> you<00:01:04.899> don't<00:01:05.049> solve<00:01:05.259> the<00:01:05.470> water

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
because if you don't solve the water

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.260 
because if you don't solve the water
problem<00:01:05.740> not<00:01:06.490> just<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:06.790> this<00:01:06.880> country<00:01:07.060> but

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
problem not just in this country but

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.969 
problem not just in this country but
across<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.750> world<00:01:07.960> that's<00:01:08.500> going<00:01:08.649> to<00:01:08.710> lead<00:01:08.860> to

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
across the world that's going to lead to

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.160 
across the world that's going to lead to
war<00:01:09.189> eventually<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:10.060> this<00:01:10.509> is<00:01:10.659> where<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:10.869> think

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
war eventually and this is where I think

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.590 
war eventually and this is where I think
engineering<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.950> science<00:01:12.340> play<00:01:12.909> a<00:01:12.939> role<00:01:13.210> now

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
engineering and science play a role now

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.749 
engineering and science play a role now
everything<00:01:14.109> has<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.289> cost<00:01:14.859> associated<00:01:15.429> with

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
everything has a cost associated with

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.760 
everything has a cost associated with
that<00:01:15.880> but<00:01:16.600> ultimately<00:01:17.020> I<00:01:17.139> think<00:01:17.409> it's<00:01:17.560> about

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
that but ultimately I think it's about

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.590 
that but ultimately I think it's about
the<00:01:17.889> quality<00:01:18.249> of<00:01:18.340> life<00:01:18.549> I<00:01:18.819> take<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.270> field<00:01:19.450> of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
the quality of life I take the field of

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.149 
the quality of life I take the field of
assistive<00:01:19.810> technology<00:01:20.560> engineering<00:01:20.950> which

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
assistive technology engineering which

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.859 
assistive technology engineering which
is<00:01:21.280> another<00:01:21.490> field<00:01:21.759> that<00:01:21.999> we<00:01:22.450> are<00:01:22.479> launching

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
is another field that we are launching

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.719 
is another field that we are launching
into<00:01:23.049> right<00:01:23.439> now<00:01:23.679> which<00:01:24.189> brings<00:01:24.490> together

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
into right now which brings together

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.910 
into right now which brings together
really<00:01:25.329> disparate<00:01:25.749> disciplines<00:01:25.929> brings

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
really disparate disciplines brings

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.319 
really disparate disciplines brings
together<00:01:27.100> engineers<00:01:27.700> on<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:27.939> one<00:01:28.090> hand

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
together engineers on the one hand

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.359 
together engineers on the one hand
computer<00:01:28.990> scientists<00:01:29.560> Health<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.310> Human

Development biologists all of them

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.489 
Development biologists all of them
creating<00:01:33.189> devices<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:34.030> processes<00:01:34.289> to<00:01:35.289> help

disabilities or just disabilities due to
aging<00:01:42.459> so<00:01:42.789> I<00:01:43.029> really<00:01:43.329> think<00:01:43.509> that<00:01:43.659> if<00:01:44.229> you

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
aging so I really think that if you

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.370 
aging so I really think that if you
think<00:01:44.649> about<00:01:44.770> engineering<00:01:45.100> as<00:01:45.759> an<00:01:46.539> enabling

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
think about engineering as an enabling

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.870 
think about engineering as an enabling
discipline<00:01:47.920> truly<00:01:48.249> I<00:01:48.340> think<00:01:48.399> it's<00:01:48.789> a

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
discipline truly I think it's a

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.129 
discipline truly I think it's a
Renaissance<00:01:49.299> discipline<00:01:49.779> you<00:01:49.840> could<00:01:49.990> be<00:01:50.079> in

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
Renaissance discipline you could be in

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:51.839 
Renaissance discipline you could be in
any<00:01:50.229> field<00:01:50.590> but<00:01:51.099> if<00:01:51.189> you're<00:01:51.310> willing<00:01:51.459> to<00:01:51.579> think

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:51.849 
any field but if you're willing to think

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.309 
any field but if you're willing to think
if<00:01:52.090> you're<00:01:52.359> willing<00:01:52.599> to<00:01:52.630> apply<00:01:52.959> what<00:01:53.170> you've
