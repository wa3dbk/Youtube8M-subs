00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.150
 I think who first half already 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.030
 However , both teams are superior 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.500
 still neutralized after the 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.510
 break turned with the first or 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.950
 single shot on goal, I believe he meets 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.869
 super than 10 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.830
 but of course we are through the 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.510
 red card maybe a bit 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.560
 favored as super returned 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.360
 have not lost our line there 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.680
 have done the game super and 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.610
 I think in the end, too 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.670
 earned reward 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.410
 It was a hard-fought game and me 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.550
 Nevertheless, we think that from the beginning 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.320
 actually the clearly better team 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.760
 was again a few the initiative 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.769
 have taken much more will 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.280
 have also shown to play forward 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:48.130
 yes i think the topic is important because 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.059
 we have 1 back yes the red 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.770
 of course it has one too 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.390
 played in the cards 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.280
 I think we have from the beginning 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.649
 here and very well presented we were 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.480
 clearly the leading team and yes 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.870
 the victory goes absolutely is absolute 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.840
 earned 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.730
 it was open high pitched by the place 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.039
 first minute to two good teams 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.810
 met and where I think 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.720
 we were the clearly better team 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.039
 About 90 minutes and we are aware 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.690
 that you have to come to terms with the fight 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.590
 about our playful means and me 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.030
 think it is quite well managed 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.560
 Such game are actually cool the 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.300
 is really fun because it goes to 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.179
 Everybody is fighting for every ball 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.440
 is fouled again are hectic us 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.979
 but that just makes it so 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.349
 football match and tip game and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.310
 and yes I'm definitely glad that 

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:31.810
 you participate in this game today 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.860
 could and I think the audience yet 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.750
 an interesting game face 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.000
 Of course, this victory gives us again 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.860
 a little bit more self confidence 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.009
 above all things like the one at first 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.630
 of course, have said moral because you 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.000
 it does not turn every day a game 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.649
 and that's what we'll say after you 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.390
 then maybe to the unfavorable 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.599
 time shortly after half-time in 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.500
 residue device of the sold out house 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.020
 can the emotions ever high 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.700
 cook but yes I think we have that 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.470
 Very good atmosphere very good today 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.440
 I do not believe so I believe that 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.760
 whole dynamo fans contributed to it 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.670
 a team though 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.340
 it can go on like this we have nine 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.780
 home games now only eight and me 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.360
 think that we have a good chance too 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.950
 Home very well and yes we want 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.840
 Of course there must continue to stay 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.510
 and the whole thing would have to expand, I think 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.610
 those are from 22 absolute highlight games 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.750
 here against dresden with the fans and me 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.590
 believe us all can look forward to 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.590
 osnabr√ºck next week
