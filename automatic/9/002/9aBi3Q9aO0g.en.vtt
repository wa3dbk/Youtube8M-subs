00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.300 

I<00:00:00.089> thought<00:00:00.989> I'd<00:00:01.170> show<00:00:01.410> you<00:00:01.439> how<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.680> typically

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
I thought I'd show you how I typically

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.660 
I thought I'd show you how I typically
light<00:00:02.700> my<00:00:02.909> scenes<00:00:03.319> this<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.560> scene<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.580> I'm

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
light my scenes this is a scene and I'm

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.200 
light my scenes this is a scene and I'm
using<00:00:05.910> an<00:00:06.150> HDR<00:00:06.600> eye<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.589> v-ray<00:00:07.980> Sun<00:00:08.280> for

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
using an HDR eye and a v-ray Sun for

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.020 
using an HDR eye and a v-ray Sun for
illumination<00:00:10.340> I'm<00:00:11.340> gonna<00:00:11.580> turn<00:00:11.849> off

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
illumination I'm gonna turn off

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.110 
illumination I'm gonna turn off
everything<00:00:12.360> but<00:00:12.599> my<00:00:12.780> lights<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:14.030> for<00:00:15.030> this

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
everything but my lights and for this

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.019 
everything but my lights and for this
example<00:00:15.299> first<00:00:15.960> I'm<00:00:16.139> gonna<00:00:16.289> turn<00:00:16.650> off<00:00:16.859> my<00:00:17.340> son

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
example first I'm gonna turn off my son

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.240 
example first I'm gonna turn off my son
and<00:00:19.400> then<00:00:20.400> my<00:00:20.660> dome<00:00:21.660> light<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:22.350> -<00:00:22.529> v-ray

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
and then my dome light here - v-ray

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.990 
and then my dome light here - v-ray
light<00:00:23.600> set<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> dome<00:00:26.269> multiplier<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.390> 30<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
light set the dome multiplier is 30 and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.220 
light set the dome multiplier is 30 and
it<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.119> visible<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.610> then<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.910> my<00:00:33.059> HDRI<00:00:33.719> in

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
it is visible and then I have my HDRI in

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.220 
it is visible and then I have my HDRI in
the<00:00:34.950> texture<00:00:35.340> slot<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:35.940> hgri<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.809> coming

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the texture slot and that hgri is coming

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.299 
the texture slot and that hgri is coming
from<00:00:37.469> HDRI<00:00:38.399> -<00:00:38.879> locations<00:00:39.390> calm<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.809> I<00:00:43.309> place

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
from HDRI - locations calm and I place

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.229 
from HDRI - locations calm and I place
that<00:00:45.140> hgri<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.680> my<00:00:47.219> environment<00:00:47.489> slot<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.180> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
that hgri in my environment slot so I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.410 
that hgri in my environment slot so I
can<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.260> viewport<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.210> that

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
can see it in the viewport and I do that

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.700 
can see it in the viewport and I do that
so<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.750> orientate<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.010> Sun<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.410> dropped

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
so I can orientate the Sun and I dropped

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.099 
so I can orientate the Sun and I dropped
that<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.219> multiplier<00:00:56.730> down<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.120> 0.25<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.930> can

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that a multiplier down to 0.25 so I can

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
that a multiplier down to 0.25 so I can
see<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.620> hotspot<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.270> rotate<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:02.640> get

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
see the hotspot and I rotate it to get

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.280 
see the hotspot and I rotate it to get
it<00:01:02.910> where<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> want<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:04.250> Sun<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.280> come<00:01:05.519> from

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
it where I want the Sun to come from

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.109 
it where I want the Sun to come from
turn<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.380> back<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:10.070> here<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.189> my<00:01:11.340> preferences

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
turn that back on here in my preferences

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.710 
turn that back on here in my preferences
I<00:01:13.340> have<00:01:14.340> my<00:01:14.670> gamma<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.390> at<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> 2.2<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
I have my gamma it's at the 2.2 and

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.380 
I have my gamma it's at the 2.2 and
output<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.840> 1<00:01:19.110> inputs<00:01:19.920> 2.2<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.759> every<00:01:21.000> texture

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
output is 1 inputs 2.2 so every texture

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
output is 1 inputs 2.2 so every texture
that<00:01:21.540> comes<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.820> comes<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.150> 2.2<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.159> then

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
that comes in comes in at 2.2 and then

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.010 
that comes in comes in at 2.2 and then
when<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> save<00:01:26.640> out<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.119> don't<00:01:27.180> double<00:01:27.720> gamma

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
when I save out so I don't double gamma

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.830 
when I save out so I don't double gamma
it's<00:01:28.799> set<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.100> 1<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.659> both<00:01:30.659> these<00:01:30.960> are<00:01:31.229> ticked

sky really nice I typically want a

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
sky really nice I typically want a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
stronger shadow from that Sun and HDR

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.070 
stronger shadow from that Sun and HDR
eyes<00:02:41.150> for<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.210> most<00:02:42.360> part<00:02:42.600> don't<00:02:42.720> provide

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.750 
eyes for the most part don't provide
that<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.940> that's<00:02:45.300> when<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.920> bring<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.310> Sun

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
that so that's when I bring in the Sun

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.800 
that so that's when I bring in the Sun
and<00:02:48.530> then<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.880> position<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.270> sky<00:02:51.480> where

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
and then I position it in the sky where

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.870

that hot spot of the HDR is and then I

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.550 
that hot spot of the HDR is and then I

I<00:03:35.810> typically<00:03:36.860> save<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.010> out<00:03:38.130> as<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.430> v-ray<00:03:39.030> image

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
I typically save it out as a v-ray image

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.340 
I typically save it out as a v-ray image
and<00:03:40.070> then<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:42.480> burns<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:43.049> all<00:03:43.200> that

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
and then it burns in all that

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.870 
and then it burns in all that
information<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:45.830> then<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:46.860> can<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.549> know<00:03:47.670> just

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
information and then I can you know just

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.570 
information and then I can you know just
exposure<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.959> After<00:03:49.260> Effects<00:03:49.590> or<00:03:49.920> Photoshop

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
exposure and After Effects or Photoshop

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.050 
exposure and After Effects or Photoshop
and<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:52.140> find<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:52.980> works<00:03:53.340> very<00:03:53.580> well<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.970> it

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
and I find that works very well and it

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.430 
and I find that works very well and it
is<00:03:54.180> burning<00:03:54.450> in<00:03:54.660> his<00:03:54.780> curve<00:03:57.140> so<00:03:58.140> that's<00:03:58.320> how<00:03:58.410> I

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
is burning in his curve so that's how I

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.180 
is burning in his curve so that's how I
set<00:03:58.709> up<00:03:58.739> my<00:04:00.080> my<00:04:01.080> scenes<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:02.100> I'm<00:04:02.760> gonna<00:04:04.160> do<00:04:05.160> a

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
set up my my scenes and I'm gonna do a

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.789 
set up my my scenes and I'm gonna do a
part<00:04:05.489> two<00:04:05.700> I'm<00:04:06.150> gonna<00:04:06.420> change<00:04:06.810> out<00:04:07.049> my<00:04:07.080> hgri

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
part two I'm gonna change out my hgri

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.630 
part two I'm gonna change out my hgri
for<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.840> sunrise<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.380> show<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.100> that<00:04:11.250> effect

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
for a sunrise and show you that effect

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.660 
for a sunrise and show you that effect
that<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.959> simple<00:04:13.410> change<00:04:13.470> can<00:04:14.250> have<00:04:14.430> on<00:04:14.580> your

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
that that simple change can have on your

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.469 
that that simple change can have on your

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
in part two I'm gonna take an HDR eye

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.710 
in part two I'm gonna take an HDR eye
from<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.900> same<00:04:25.110> site<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:26.850> purchased<00:04:27.630> I

like to have more but so far I have two
of<00:04:32.580> them<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:32.910> then<00:04:33.030> I'll<00:04:33.150> swap<00:04:34.140> out<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.410> HDR

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
of them and then I'll swap out that HDR

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.020 
of them and then I'll swap out that HDR
I<00:04:35.039> for<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.460> son

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030
