00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.639
 I servants were abandoned after all 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.150
 I can escape from here or escape 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:56.800
 There is an anti-necessary road to the ground from there that can 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:01.719
 There is a parking lot next to the area where we want to go. 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:05.529
 There is a small entrance to the front door and the front door journal 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:09.429

 Four wheel drive character I need a little more time to ensure the escape road 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.680

 Not a nuclear bomb Payo to penetrate his resignation even the good luck or to thing that was decided in his will 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:41.910
 The way of life that already regrets the past has stopped 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.580
