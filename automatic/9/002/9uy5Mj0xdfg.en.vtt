00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:08.710
 I think that I want to go with the data of Gundam a bit unusually today 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:16.760
 I because it is eddy's it based on team-generation quantum 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:20.330
 I really like it, so I 'm talking about Gundam, but it 's a continuation of the story of the archery bullet universe century now 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.170
 Japan Gundam is insanely good, I hope it's done 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:29.029
 But this Tabun'ne have seen people I think that is well understood but 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.070
 The directing story character music is also great 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:36.500
 On May 17 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.309
 The final story will be released on Episode 7 of Unicon Gundam, so it will be soon 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.590
 is not it 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.160
 So even if it is a little video, I 've been promoting Sang-woo 's, and I 'll take this tower a little 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.800
 It is built 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.449
 Of course, I'm watching from 1 bird to 6 episodes firmly and I'm doing that stock, but I've seen it many times 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.060
 Does it say about Chau 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.150
 Right? 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.700
 I long ago I Toka ne Episode 8 particularly 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.280
 It came out old building suit 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.270
 At the time 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:06.680
 There is an effect that people who know it are really back up 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:11.240
 Gundam is various all over, or it is a space century, but its easy fight 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.140
 There are a lot of things like that Gundam Seat Tableau Gundam, but here they are recent 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.450
 The children are 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.270
 A child who enters from a Gundam seed or a cat that enters from a Gundam double o 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.350
 When there are many 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.729
 But I was the first girl of the first generation , but only full data 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:32.399
 There is little I opportunity I'm about to Tsu do not know Well set cars people might often 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:37.649
 When I take a look at the rental dvd or something, I see that this is the main reason for viewing 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.290
 You may know that it looks like Cannes of space products So you like it 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:44.410
 When 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:45.460
 I really look forward to the Unicorn Gundam basics, but it's a great achievement and I still look 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.520
 If you do not have it 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.400
 Would not it good to try to try to borrow because the rental dvd 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.960
 In this six good correspondence Gumpler 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.280
 Is this Unicorn Gundam Gundam cut key Introduction It is a version Choi box of 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.290
 I 'm getting involved 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:06.220
 I have already assembled this, but isn't it the package of recent gun plastic 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:10.210
 It is sloppy I can see this if it is sloppy 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.010
 It's not cool, but I love the way it is 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.010
 The commanding place where full frontal will be 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:32.569
 Booboo says this is First Gundam eh rx 78 's 2 under 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:33.770
 Good idea for your consideration 140 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:40.070
 Version N 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:41.570
 I once even Te fan Posted Kakkoi' small school in the vortex's time as a reference for it here 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.430
 I bought it when I went 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.090
 I'm out of the Gunpla package, but this is Gunpla, of course . 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.200
 I from 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.340
 I bought it, but from this package, the store just now has a package 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.959
 It was totally different yes 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.319
 It is not a type that makes plastic model obstinately in front of the bowl, so I just buy it and assemble it 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.340
 I'm only 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:08.430
 Well this is a typical model buying a cool plastic package is this 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.120
 It is a nest life leader in the state like Seven Eleven 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.110
 Seven-Eleven limited version but the package is also cool 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.700
 Ne this is a patient who has a puke 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.700
 We do not have assembled a There is only an outside open the stone tube 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.800
 Completely intact 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.180
 I bought one more than half a year ago The sound of the present I guess now in front of the 7-Eleven sound register 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.629
 Of such Seven-Eleven limited 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.780
 Dangerous dangerous I'd sometimes Gundam is moving 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:41.220
 I 'm a little disappointed 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:44.200
 I was allowed to chic aiming for the story of Gundam today that it is dangerous 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.220
 In buying and selling is also in a different video 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.770
 Anyway, hey unicorn Gundam is so good 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.220
 You should look at it 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:57.700
 Variety is a good Well Katcho become with waist 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:02.590
 Be careful if you want to mobilize the character cool and puzzled 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:06.849
 The hall is home information, but this is the Canon pixus series 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:12.160
 I always do a campaign with a printer and a performance set , but this time 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:13.660
 Sound of Caron's Sound A quarter of a quarter is given a number of times for 500 people 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.690
 In You're lottery 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:23.990
 By direction of texture is that from May 17 to August 3 days 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:27.110
 If you buy the Canon printer car ink, it's a no-radio campaign . 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:32.720
 It means that there is a chance of applying for Kirua . 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:35.390
 If you like random by all means I would like to have a tea ceremony campaign Shan Ease 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.710
 By say But I of the Well 1/48 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:42.420
 Many times in affiliation place if there is a good work 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:46.460
 Please try by all means challenge by saying Well then his once opposed hits you 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.460
 It seems that this appearance is put in the shop
