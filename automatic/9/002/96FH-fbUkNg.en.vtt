00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
to it at all or no the only thing I did

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.140

was<00:01:38.590> touch<00:01:38.830> up<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.130> little<00:01:39.160> paint<00:01:39.580> on<00:01:39.730> the<00:01:39.910> black

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150

was touch up a little paint on the black
paint<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.780> cylinders<00:01:41.440> were<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:42.670> were

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
paint on the cylinders were they were

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.910 
paint on the cylinders were they were
rusty<00:01:43.270> know<00:01:43.810> they<00:01:44.050> always<00:01:44.230> rest<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.680> truth

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
rusty know they always rest the truth

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.719 
rusty know they always rest the truth
yeah<00:01:46.440> so<00:01:47.440> you've<00:01:47.590> never<00:01:47.770> had<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.130> top<00:01:48.280> end<00:01:48.550> off

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
yeah so you've never had the top end off

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:58.310 
yeah so you've never had the top end off
or<00:01:49.000> no

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.910 

forty-seven<00:01:59.320> thousand<00:01:59.890> 601<00:02:01.620> and<00:02:02.620> I<00:02:02.740> was

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
forty-seven thousand 601 and I was

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.160 
forty-seven thousand 601 and I was
making<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.610> Bobby<00:02:03.909> this<00:02:04.600> has<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.960> latest

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
making the Bobby this has the latest

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.400 
making the Bobby this has the latest
I'll<00:02:05.500> knuckle<00:02:05.920> frame<00:02:06.220> I<00:02:07.050> imagine<00:02:08.050> this<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.229> one

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
I'll knuckle frame I imagine this is one

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.830 
I'll knuckle frame I imagine this is one
of<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.560> first<00:02:08.770> ones<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:10.360> came<00:02:10.569> out<00:02:10.660> with

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
of the first ones they came out with

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.150 
of the first ones they came out with
that<00:02:10.899> frame<00:02:11.170> because<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.410> only<00:02:11.590> started<00:02:11.890> making

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
that frame because I only started making

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.850 
that frame because I only started making
right<00:02:12.340> about<00:02:12.580> six<00:02:12.819> thousand<00:02:13.590> but<00:02:14.590> might<00:02:14.770> have

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
right about six thousand but might have

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.100 
right about six thousand but might have
been<00:02:14.950> pretty<00:02:15.820> much<00:02:15.970> with<00:02:16.240> six<00:02:16.510> thousand<00:02:17.050> I

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
been pretty much with six thousand I

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.610 
been pretty much with six thousand I
guess<00:02:18.690> anything<00:02:19.690> else<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.200> can<00:02:20.260> tell<00:02:20.380> us

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
guess anything else that you can tell us

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:33.010 
guess anything else that you can tell us
about<00:02:20.709> this<00:02:20.980> whole<00:02:21.160> bike<00:02:21.340> club<00:02:21.580> not<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.270> thing
