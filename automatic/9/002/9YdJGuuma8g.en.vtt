00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.150
 these cases 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.330

 jordan to charles 19 years defender or 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.650
 the field so I joined the group 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.879
 pro last december and then there I know 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.570
 my first year that I resume with 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.570
 the professional team 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.170
 the 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.720
 we have resumed training since Monday 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.420
 there were quite a few new players 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.530
 a lot of new recruits for 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.460
 the moment there is a very good atmosphere 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:06.050
 between us and that's it I really hope 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.400
 that this atmosphere between us is going 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:13.940
 pass on on the ground so here's 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.560
 for the moment we have started again 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.590
 a little crescendo at the level of 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.200
 trainings we really care about 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.900
 start friendly matches for 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.510
 can we be level 2 at the level 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.720
 of the fair sex and I'm really happy to 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.580
 take them back for the first time that 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.020
 the to the professionals and make a real 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.000
 physical preparation with the group and 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.360
 already beats on the first week we see 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.960
 that it's a lot more intense than 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:48.229
 with the reserve is good it's better 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.610
 going let's allow us to undo a 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.640
 good season and physically ready 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.290
 and a power is to chain the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.880
 matches as long as possible 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.700
 we are here to do the job so 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.000
 to play football good charge happens 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.470
 in a really nice group I see 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.940
 good guys in the group 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.250
 frankly I hope it will tighten 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.700
 hen on the field first this year 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.430
 our success had to go up to league 2 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.790
 I hope we'll do it said it's 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.790
 the end of the season 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.859
 but their audience seems to be a 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.980
 pretty technical guy 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:32.219
 well I think a quality after these 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.670
 flaws I still do not know a big 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.180
 defect last of the times when we do 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.879
 little games in training 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.709
 matches for an offensive midfielder 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.200
 attempted technical gestures or what if he 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.849
 has qualities otherwise it's only on the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.670
 land where he will be always there 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.180
 to guide me and we put ourselves on 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.389
 The good way 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.019
 he only has qualities sincerely I 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.730
 see no defect he handsome kid if he 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.560
 please everyone since life that 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.230
 especially to the women of the public 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.379
 not really seen that it's a very good 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.419
 guardian communicates a lot about the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.450
 ground it is on wood on the defects 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:14.099
 we will wait maybe a month for 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.739
 to pronounce because we all have faults 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.049
 but after the level of quality so 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.060
 already his career and his cv speaks for 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.120
 so he already at the football level he goes 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.879
 bring us his experience from the top 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.010
 level his experience from abroad so 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.359
 already that's a big quality then 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.370
 then it seems to be someone like 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.220
 you said who likes to laugh who 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.530
 like to put the good mood so that 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.409
 is not going to be too much this year in the 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.379
 group I think no same energy comes 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.239
 to know a week so I know 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.729
 only when who is good at their property 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.409
 he laughs all the time too 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:53.430
 Well, you see he's a good defender 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.199
 and the tough ones on the man beats his faults 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.919
 for me I do not know so we'll see 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.919
 with time 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.220
 or 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.450
 for to support us to help us 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.990
 in difficult times because the 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.760
 season the season she will be she will have 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.320
 ups and downs it will take 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.790
 really fight to fetch 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.290
 the results so we rely on 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.600
 you want you to fulfill your 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.540
 role like not to fill ours 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.170
 so we have to push ourselves there 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.320
 do not get us down trying to de 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.540
 commands to pull the positive from the 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.120
 last season and especially the negative and 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.360
 correct that on our side and yours 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.790
 as well 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.160
 I think it's clear that we need 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.169
 of an audience that really pushes his 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.010
 team because last year when 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.860
 I came a game will try mena 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.690
 well, all the teams we are 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.440
 gives all thoroughly because the ground 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.930
 is beautiful the stage here and if we do not have 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.470
 supporters who really pushes his 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.050
 team 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.350
 Well, I think it's going to be very, very 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.990
 difficult to take points so we 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.360
 needs everyone and I think 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.720
 what to subscribe 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.120
 you will not regret it but it's 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.140
 sure at first I had a ball at 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.729
 belly before returning to the field 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.729
 and before starting the match 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.490
 after we have come back 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.470
 on the field to 200% on on the match 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.240
 and after we miss all that but 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.690
 it's true that if the fans are there 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.400

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.500

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.690
 pleasure and it still makes you want to be 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.030
 is to be better and there is a team 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.430
 is overcoming 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.070
 so do not hesitate to support me
