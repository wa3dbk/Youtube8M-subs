00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.339
 for a new video unpacking of 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.170
 parcel opening parcel I do not know 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.809
 you say how you want here I have 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.880
 my big package that has finally arrived I 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.130
 take my scissors and that's 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.580
 party for together 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.310
 as much as I had yesterday and it was 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.590
 super long term to forget it 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.740
 today but hey that you have 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.000
 promised to open it with you so it is 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:36.809
 Whereas believe me it's not easy 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.190
 with 2006 at the time montreux vie voilÃ  

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.420
 so there are lots of little mosses 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.690
 in so I'm already fired the little ones 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.690
 foams 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.300
 there is so in the middle of the collar and so I 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.140
 check that there is nothing in it when we 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.140
 only blacks here 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:09.270
 and in this package there is a big package 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.270
 weleda so we'll die right now 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.070
 this big package weleda see what he 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.170
 contains then is it really 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.120
 weleda projects or is it not 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.340
 it is an assortment so in fact 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.770
 it was just a box to be able to 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.110
 stow everything in and so we go 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.630
 open and we will watch together what 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.950
 that he then counts first of all the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.930
 first big tubes that I catch 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.200
 it's actually a shower gel of the brand 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.260
 melvita alas and pulpy citrus 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.900
 he shows up like that and my faith it has 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.660
 looks nice, I'll feel 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.700
 right away we know you I am 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.440
 a lot more trendy soaps but that's 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.280
 true only from time to time when I know 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.320
 not when you go on vacation or 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.119
 when summer comes to me for children 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.190
 it's true that they know it they are 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.660
 not always a fan so this is good 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.229
 to have it's nice killer to have a 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.000
 little shower gel at home so they 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.020
 are fake bond it no cost they are 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.570
 really citrus 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.090
 so here I see it's sweet orange 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.010
 high lemon and fresh mandarin so 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.870
 a whole program so refreshing 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.510
 for the summer then second product 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.800
 again a melvita and melvita care you 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.780
 know that I really like 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.080
 a lot this mark is an oil of 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.510
 facial care so arguing over so a 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.810
 of fair money and so checkered 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.370
 vegetable origin firmness nutrition 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.980
 so it looks like that in a 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.140
 beautiful beautiful packaging time and i 'm going 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.460
 try to retake the commands m 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.300
 the sun of the blow and we will look so 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.390
 started that's it so it comes up in 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.800
 done in a bottle like that I'm going to 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.380
 put towards art the bottle is 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.300
 frankly and super super nice so is 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.830
 what is it that argan oil I 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.740
 do not know I'm going to look so the 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.400
 composition then agree in fact this is 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.950
 a cetacean dress actually on which so 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.250
 we support it here and it comes out in 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.710
 pipette it can really be pretty 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.710
 everything's take a look at the pump water 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.440
 it's closer and I'll tell you true at 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.930
 running so then there is still so 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.570
 one to awesome a bb cream color 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.540
 caramel so that's the hue 11 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.520
 so I have some brand products 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.170
 caramel color but they are rather 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.150
 eye shadows that by the way 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.040
 I love could find moreover 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.730
 several tutorial on my channel so 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.770
 in the 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.480
 I think there is a little tab rather 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.320
 make up make up something in style 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.450
 here and so the bar listen I am 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.620
 very happy to be able to test this because 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.110
 that it's really a brand whose 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.970
 I hear a lot of good and I have 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.520
 really looking forward to trying so I will 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.120
 will make a makeup with 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.020
 and the last product and here it is 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:20.070
 a palette I think caramel color 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:22.320
 then and no it's not a palette I 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.880
 think it's a blush 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.990
 it's just beautiful 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:31.700
 here is a beautiful bluff there is the hue 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.700
 for those who will ask me 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.430
 there is no color 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.430
 while I'm doing it 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.419
 I can not get it out there I'll try 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.740
 to do it just now I have not too much 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.720
 want to make two disasters 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.280
 I would like the name of the hues in 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.759
 always in others and all products 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:00.000
 that I received I still have a small 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.250
 word with so this package actually was only 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.110
 sent so as part of a 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.789
 partnership so I still want to 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.740
 you report it the products are only 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.139
 not happen like that at home by chance 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.690
 so I was contacted by the website 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.460
 organic girlfriends and so he was proposing me in 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.690
 to test several several 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.729
 products from their site 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.169
 so it was totally surprising 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.030
 since I do not know at all what 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.289
 to hold my package so I'll hold you 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.830
 aware I think I'll make you a 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:28.319
 tutorial anyway with the creamy bb and the 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.720
 bluff to show you what it gives 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.370
 and I 'll do it anyway I think 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.650
 to an article where there will surely be a 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.210
 video on one of the two products once 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.919
 I hated not a product 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.479
 finished or so if really there was 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.389
 a real crush they are part of 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.820
 my favorites in a month to come 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.139
 I hope it has not been too much 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.190
 too searched I'm sorry I had 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.199
 really not much time in front of 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.570
 me to make this video but I had 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.490
 great desire to actually debate my 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.659
 package so I make you full of 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.430
 big kisses I you are a beautiful 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.900
