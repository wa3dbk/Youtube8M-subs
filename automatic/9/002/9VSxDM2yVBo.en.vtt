00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.790 

I<00:00:00.299> think<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.140> will<00:00:01.260> make<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.560> pretty

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
I think this will make a pretty

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.919 
I think this will make a pretty
interesting<00:00:02.460> video<00:00:02.610> cuz<00:00:03.480> I<00:00:03.540> plan<00:00:03.750> on<00:00:03.780> using

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
interesting video cuz I plan on using

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.369 
interesting video cuz I plan on using
some<00:00:04.440> relatively<00:00:05.040> different<00:00:05.819> techniques

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:06.379 
some relatively different techniques

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.839 
some relatively different techniques
what<00:00:07.379> I've<00:00:07.500> done<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.799> I've<00:00:07.950> taken<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.400> piece<00:00:08.639> of

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
what I've done is I've taken a piece of

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.770 
what I've done is I've taken a piece of
one-inch<00:00:09.750> hard<00:00:10.559> maple<00:00:10.980> stock<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.969> I've

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
one-inch hard maple stock and I've

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.820 
one-inch hard maple stock and I've
traced<00:00:13.049> out<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> couple<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.830> spoons<00:00:14.429> on<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:15.030> it

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
traced out a couple of spoons on to it

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.380 
traced out a couple of spoons on to it
the<00:00:16.830> first<00:00:17.039> obstacle<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.760> consider<00:00:18.180> when

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the first obstacle to consider when

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.200 
the first obstacle to consider when
making<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.810> spoon<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.350> how<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> make<00:00:19.770> this

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
making a spoon is how to make this

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.040 
making a spoon is how to make this
concave<00:00:21.210> portion<00:00:23.600> obviously<00:00:24.600> that's<00:00:24.810> not

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
concave portion obviously that's not

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.200 
concave portion obviously that's not
going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.470> simple<00:00:25.740> with<00:00:26.210> conventional

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210

going to be simple with conventional
woodworking<00:00:28.170> strategies<00:00:28.769> or<00:00:29.130> tools<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:30.560> have

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
woodworking strategies or tools I have

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.069 
woodworking strategies or tools I have
no<00:00:31.830> interest<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.430> whittling<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> started<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
no interest in whittling so I started to

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.560 
no interest in whittling so I started to
experiment<00:00:34.649> with<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.190> device<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.450> can

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
experiment with this device and you can

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.600 
experiment with this device and you can
see<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.870> its<00:00:37.020> back<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.440> forth<00:00:37.770> motion<00:00:38.070> makes

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
see that its back and forth motion makes

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.569 
see that its back and forth motion makes
this<00:00:38.850> nice<00:00:39.120> sort<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.170> concave<00:00:40.860> elliptical

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
this nice sort of concave elliptical

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.920 
this nice sort of concave elliptical
shape<00:00:43.730> when<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.760> look<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.149> close<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.660> see

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
shape when you look up close you can see

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.670 
shape when you look up close you can see
what<00:00:46.079> its<00:00:46.200> back<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> forth<00:00:46.920> motion<00:00:47.280> does<00:00:48.680> and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
what its back and forth motion does and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.020 
what its back and forth motion does and
you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.920> imagine<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.430> type<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.640> shape<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you can imagine the type of shape that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.020 
you can imagine the type of shape that
it<00:00:51.360> makes<00:00:51.829> this<00:00:52.829> device<00:00:53.129> was<00:00:53.460> invented<00:00:53.610> by

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it makes this device was invented by

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
it makes this device was invented by
NoHo<00:00:54.449> 91<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.230> think<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.890> find<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.280> by

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
NoHo 91 I think you can find it by

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.270 
NoHo 91 I think you can find it by
searching<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:57.030> wave<00:00:57.899> pattern<00:00:58.500> shaver<00:00:58.949> or

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
searching for wave pattern shaver or

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.150 
searching for wave pattern shaver or
something<00:00:59.699> similar<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.890> but<00:01:01.890> I've<00:01:01.980> been

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
something similar to that but I've been

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.950 
something similar to that but I've been
experimenting<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.300> device<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.840> I've

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
experimenting with this device and I've

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.140 
experimenting with this device and I've
found<00:01:04.290> some<00:01:04.439> pretty<00:01:04.920> neat<00:01:05.189> applications<00:01:05.850> for

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
found some pretty neat applications for

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.500 
found some pretty neat applications for
it<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:07.100> don't<00:01:08.100> really<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> correct<00:01:09.150> bit

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it I don't really have the correct bit

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.960 
it I don't really have the correct bit
for<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.960> procedure<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.619> make<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.979> concave

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
for this procedure to make the concave

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.149 
for this procedure to make the concave
portion<00:01:12.240> nice<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.900> smooth<00:01:13.229> I've<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.979> been

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
portion nice and smooth I've just been

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.200 
portion nice and smooth I've just been
using<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.850> round<00:01:15.750> nose<00:01:16.170> bit<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.790> without

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
using this round nose bit and so without

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.240 
using this round nose bit and so without
sacrificing<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.439> existing<00:01:20.009> router

sacrificing one of my existing router

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.580 
sacrificing one of my existing router
bits<00:01:20.610> by<00:01:20.790> chopping<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.330> apart<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.470> going

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
bits by chopping it apart I'm just going

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.399 
bits by chopping it apart I'm just going
to<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.180> make<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to have to make do with what I have and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.859 
to have to make do with what I have and
I'll<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.740> through<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.100> some<00:01:26.250> sanding

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
I'll get through it with some sanding

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.999 
I'll get through it with some sanding
one<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> ideas<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.380> I've<00:01:28.619> been<00:01:28.710> playing

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
one of the ideas that I've been playing

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.069 
one of the ideas that I've been playing
with<00:01:29.100> recently<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.030> install<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.720> device

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
with recently is to install this device

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.490 
with recently is to install this device
on<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> bearing<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:34.200> it's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
on a bearing like this and then it's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.499 
on a bearing like this and then it's
back-and-forth<00:01:35.460> motion<00:01:35.700> would<00:01:36.030> make<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
back-and-forth motion would make a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.670 
back-and-forth motion would make a
perfect<00:01:37.049> portion<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.549> sphere<00:01:39.290> but<00:01:40.290> this

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
perfect portion of a sphere but this

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.060 
perfect portion of a sphere but this
maybe<00:01:41.100> will<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> later<00:01:41.939> video<00:01:42.890> before<00:01:43.890> I

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
maybe will be for a later video before I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.740 
maybe will be for a later video before I
proceed<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.549> should<00:01:44.820> probably<00:01:44.970> mention<00:01:45.450> that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
proceed I should probably mention that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.630 
proceed I should probably mention that
this<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.439> intended<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.310> spoon

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
this is not intended to be a spoon

spoon making tutorial I probably

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.050 
spoon making tutorial I probably
wouldn't<00:01:56.070> recommend<00:01:56.399> any<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.880> these

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
wouldn't recommend any of these

this<00:02:02.100> device<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.000> picked<00:02:03.240> up

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
this device that I just picked up

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.649 
this device that I just picked up
recently<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.500> found<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.979> be

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
recently and I found it to be

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.440 
recently and I found it to be
handy<00:02:06.140> for<00:02:06.320> woodworking<00:02:06.999> what<00:02:07.999> it<00:02:08.119> is<00:02:08.269> is<00:02:08.420> a

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
handy for woodworking what it is is a

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.290 
handy for woodworking what it is is a
variable<00:02:09.050> speed<00:02:09.200> knob<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:10.819> works<00:02:11.000> great

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
variable speed knob and it works great

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.020 
variable speed knob and it works great
in<00:02:11.569> situations<00:02:12.470> like<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:12.890> with<00:02:13.849> this

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
in situations like this with this

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.330 
in situations like this with this
old-fashioned<00:02:14.930> router<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.680> guess<00:02:16.190> they

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
old-fashioned router that I guess they

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.979 
old-fashioned router that I guess they
didn't<00:02:16.580> believe<00:02:16.849> in<00:02:17.030> variable<00:02:17.510> speed<00:02:17.750> at<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
didn't believe in variable speed at the

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.199 
didn't believe in variable speed at the
time<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:18.500> by<00:02:18.980> today's<00:02:19.340> standards<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:19.940> router

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
time so by today's standards this router

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:31.420 
time so by today's standards this router
would<00:02:20.629> really<00:02:20.989> be<00:02:21.170> useless<00:02:21.769> without<00:02:22.340> this

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.010 

you<00:02:32.430> can<00:02:32.580> imagine<00:02:32.790> since<00:02:33.240> I'm<00:02:33.360> using<00:02:33.600> hard

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
you can imagine since I'm using hard

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.870 
you can imagine since I'm using hard
maple<00:02:34.470> for<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:34.800> video<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.430> how<00:02:35.610> useful

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
maple for this video just how useful

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.780 
maple for this video just how useful
this<00:02:36.210> will<00:02:36.360> be<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.980> should<00:02:37.980> also<00:02:38.250> point<00:02:38.640> out

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
this will be I should also point out

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.850 
this will be I should also point out
that<00:02:38.850> I've<00:02:39.090> found<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.690> lot<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:40.020> uses<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:40.710> this

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
that I've found a lot of uses for this

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.950 
that I've found a lot of uses for this
device<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.460> especially<00:02:42.030> think<00:02:42.450> it's<00:02:42.630> useful

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
device I especially think it's useful

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.560 
device I especially think it's useful
for<00:02:42.990> Palm<00:02:43.410> Sanders<00:02:44.070> because<00:02:44.670> sometimes<00:02:45.150> it's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
for Palm Sanders because sometimes it's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.780 
for Palm Sanders because sometimes it's
really<00:02:45.960> nice<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.170> tone<00:02:46.650> down<00:02:46.680> how<00:02:47.250> aggressive

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
really nice to tone down how aggressive

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.440 
really nice to tone down how aggressive
Palm<00:02:48.150> Sanders<00:02:48.660> run<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.970> would<00:02:50.970> also<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.390> to

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
Palm Sanders run I would also like to

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.290 
Palm Sanders run I would also like to
try<00:02:51.750> using<00:02:51.960> this<00:02:52.260> device<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:52.830> my<00:02:53.220> bandsaw<00:02:53.820> but

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
try using this device on my bandsaw but

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.900 
try using this device on my bandsaw but
I'm<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.450> little<00:02:54.810> afraid<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.950> think<00:02:56.550> it'll<00:02:56.670> take<00:02:56.850> a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
I'm a little afraid I think it'll take a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.580 
I'm a little afraid I think it'll take a
little<00:02:57.120> more<00:02:57.330> research<00:02:57.840> before<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.350> can

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
little more research before I can

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.380 
little more research before I can
determine<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.160> it's<00:02:59.280> safe<00:02:59.460> to<00:02:59.610> use<00:02:59.640> on<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
determine it it's safe to use on the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.950 
determine it it's safe to use on the
band<00:03:00.600> saws<00:03:00.810> motor<00:03:02.360> if<00:03:03.360> anybody<00:03:03.780> out<00:03:03.930> there

things please drop a comment and let me
know<00:03:09.080> looking<00:03:10.080> down<00:03:10.290> into<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.830> device<00:03:11.220> you

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
know looking down into the device you

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.990 
know looking down into the device you
can<00:03:12.120> see<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.720> drew<00:03:13.280> rough<00:03:14.280> approximation

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
can see that I drew rough approximation

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.600 
can see that I drew rough approximation
of<00:03:15.060> what<00:03:15.480> I'd<00:03:15.570> like<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.780> route<00:03:16.110> out<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.770> also<00:03:17.460> I

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
of what I'd like to route out and also I

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.810 
of what I'd like to route out and also I
drew<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.060> line<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:18.840> perpendicular<00:03:19.110> to

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
drew this line that's perpendicular to

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.360 
drew this line that's perpendicular to
the<00:03:20.820> spoon<00:03:21.810> itself<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.560> use<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.920> framing

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
the spoon itself I use the framing

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.940 
the spoon itself I use the framing
square<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.790> determine<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.480> line<00:03:24.890> also<00:03:25.890> you

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
square to determine that line also you

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.070 
square to determine that line also you
can<00:03:26.190> see<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.550> on<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:27.000> inside<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.600> my<00:03:27.810> device

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
can see that on the inside of my device

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.810 
can see that on the inside of my device
I<00:03:28.290> had<00:03:28.380> these<00:03:28.500> little<00:03:28.710> pencil<00:03:29.250> marks<00:03:29.520> on<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
I had these little pencil marks on the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.110 
I had these little pencil marks on the
side<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.210> it<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:31.140> allows<00:03:31.380> me<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:32.120> place

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
side of it and that allows me to place

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.060 
side of it and that allows me to place
it<00:03:33.360> along<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.780> perpendicular<00:03:34.440> line<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.920> make

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
it along the perpendicular line to make

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.780 
it along the perpendicular line to make
sure<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.370> I'm<00:03:35.490> square<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:38.010> clamping<00:03:38.490> setup

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
sure that I'm square the clamping setup

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.670 
sure that I'm square the clamping setup
that<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:38.970> came<00:03:39.090> up<00:03:39.420> with<00:03:39.450> uses<00:03:40.050> this<00:03:40.550> fence<00:03:41.550> here

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
that I came up with uses this fence here

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.350 
that I came up with uses this fence here
that<00:03:43.680> applies<00:03:43.980> pressure<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.850> board<00:03:45.150> that

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
that applies pressure to the board that

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.420 
that applies pressure to the board that
I<00:03:45.420> want<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.660> route<00:03:47.720> this<00:03:48.720> will<00:03:49.080> go<00:03:49.320> up<00:03:49.680> against

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
I want to route this will go up against

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.520 
I want to route this will go up against
the<00:03:50.520> fence<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.420> allows<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.930> move<00:03:52.170> back

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
the fence and it allows it to move back

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.050 
the fence and it allows it to move back
and<00:03:52.770> forth<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.950> first<00:03:56.190> route<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.670> make<00:03:56.880> is

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
and forth the first route that I make is

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.490 
and forth the first route that I make is
going<00:03:57.240> to<00:03:57.300> take<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.600> smallest<00:03:57.990> amount<00:03:58.350> of

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
going to take the smallest amount of

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.060 
going to take the smallest amount of
material<00:03:59.010> obviously<00:03:59.610> so<00:04:00.420> as<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:01.230> move<00:04:01.860> in

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
material obviously so as I move in

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.970 
material obviously so as I move in
towards<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.640> center<00:04:03.210> of<00:04:03.240> the<00:04:03.390> spoon<00:04:03.980> where

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
towards the center of the spoon where

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.430 
towards the center of the spoon where
it's<00:04:05.100> deeper<00:04:05.610> I'll<00:04:05.790> restrict<00:04:06.690> its<00:04:06.990> motion

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
it's deeper I'll restrict its motion

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:38.050 
it's deeper I'll restrict its motion
more

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.300 

now<00:04:39.060> for<00:04:39.300> my<00:04:39.420> second<00:04:39.870> pass<00:04:40.080> I've<00:04:40.560> moved<00:04:41.040> each

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
now for my second pass I've moved each

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.170 
now for my second pass I've moved each
of<00:04:41.490> my<00:04:41.670> stop<00:04:42.090> box<00:04:42.450> in<00:04:43.200> towards<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.430> spoon<00:04:44.850> an

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
of my stop box in towards the spoon an

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.290 
of my stop box in towards the spoon an
eighth<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.140> an<00:04:46.410> inch<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.920> also<00:04:47.850> I've<00:04:48.000> lowered

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
eighth of an inch and also I've lowered

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.360 
eighth of an inch and also I've lowered
the<00:04:48.600> depth<00:04:48.930> on<00:04:49.260> my<00:04:49.470> router<00:04:49.680> bed<00:04:49.920> an<00:04:50.040> eighth<00:04:50.190> of

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
the depth on my router bed an eighth of

00:04:50.370 --> 00:05:30.100 
the depth on my router bed an eighth of
an<00:04:50.490> inch

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.020 

well<00:05:31.110> every<00:05:31.440> step<00:05:31.680> of<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.889> way<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.070> moved<00:05:32.550> my

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
well every step of the way I moved my

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.659 
well every step of the way I moved my
blocks<00:05:33.360> in<00:05:33.690> towards<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.560> center<00:05:34.919> 1/8<00:05:35.370> of<00:05:35.550> an

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
blocks in towards the center 1/8 of an

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.320 
blocks in towards the center 1/8 of an
inch<00:05:35.790> and<00:05:36.150> I<00:05:36.780> would<00:05:36.960> lower<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.699> routers<00:05:38.699> depth

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
inch and I would lower the routers depth

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.090 
inch and I would lower the routers depth
an<00:05:39.600> eighth<00:05:39.780> of<00:05:39.930> an<00:05:40.080> inch<00:05:40.199> and<00:05:40.530> I<00:05:40.770> did<00:05:40.979> that

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
an eighth of an inch and I did that

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.340 
an eighth of an inch and I did that
about<00:05:41.220> four<00:05:41.639> times<00:05:41.970> until<00:05:42.570> I<00:05:42.990> got<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.260> the

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
about four times until I got to the

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.230 
about four times until I got to the
middle<00:05:43.500> right<00:05:44.100> now<00:05:44.250> at<00:05:44.400> the<00:05:44.520> dead<00:05:44.820> center<00:05:45.210> I

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
middle right now at the dead center I

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.689 
middle right now at the dead center I
have<00:05:45.330> about<00:05:45.720> a<00:05:45.780> third<00:05:46.169> of<00:05:46.320> an<00:05:46.440> inch<00:05:46.740> in<00:05:47.190> depth

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
have about a third of an inch in depth

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.200 
have about a third of an inch in depth
which<00:05:48.660> is<00:05:48.900> not<00:05:49.199> quite<00:05:49.470> deep<00:05:49.889> enough<00:05:50.310> and<00:05:51.060> I'll

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
which is not quite deep enough and I'll

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.330 
which is not quite deep enough and I'll
give<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:51.479> a<00:05:51.540> better<00:05:51.720> close-up<00:05:52.350> here<00:05:55.190> you<00:05:56.190> can

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
give you a better close-up here you can

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.460 
give you a better close-up here you can
see<00:05:56.520> that<00:05:56.669> I<00:05:56.699> also<00:05:57.000> didn't<00:05:57.690> make<00:05:58.020> it<00:05:58.169> the<00:05:58.290> whole

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
see that I also didn't make it the whole

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.900 
see that I also didn't make it the whole
way<00:05:58.650> to<00:05:58.710> my<00:05:59.870> lines<00:06:01.340> so<00:06:02.340> I'm<00:06:02.430> going<00:06:02.580> to<00:06:02.610> have<00:06:02.760> to

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
way to my lines so I'm going to have to

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.090 
way to my lines so I'm going to have to
move<00:06:03.180> my<00:06:03.449> fence<00:06:03.690> back<00:06:04.020> and<00:06:04.380> then<00:06:04.590> move<00:06:04.979> it

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
move my fence back and then move it

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.300 
move my fence back and then move it
forward<00:06:05.520> and<00:06:05.669> do<00:06:05.880> each<00:06:06.530> of<00:06:07.530> these<00:06:07.889> with

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
forward and do each of these with

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.510 
forward and do each of these with
another<00:06:08.639> set<00:06:09.000> up<00:06:09.180> so<00:06:10.139> as<00:06:10.470> to<00:06:10.979> whether<00:06:11.250> or<00:06:11.340> not

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
another set up so as to whether or not

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.670 
another set up so as to whether or not
this<00:06:11.760> is<00:06:11.940> practical<00:06:12.630> from<00:06:12.840> US<00:06:13.080> time

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
this is practical from US time

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.430 
this is practical from US time
perspective<00:06:14.190> probably<00:06:15.060> not<00:06:15.479> but<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.169> device

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
perspective probably not but the device

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.580 
perspective probably not but the device
is<00:06:16.470> pretty<00:06:16.770> entertaining<00:06:17.070> to<00:06:17.760> use<00:06:18.000> so<00:06:18.360> I<00:06:18.600> have

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
is pretty entertaining to use so I have

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.430 
is pretty entertaining to use so I have
no<00:06:19.770> objections<00:06:20.310> this<00:06:20.520> far<00:06:21.050> well<00:06:22.050> nothing

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
no objections this far well nothing

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.810 
no objections this far well nothing
really<00:06:22.560> makes<00:06:22.860> you<00:06:23.010> better<00:06:23.250> at<00:06:23.370> something

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
really makes you better at something

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.060 
really makes you better at something
like<00:06:23.970> practice<00:06:24.690> and<00:06:24.960> I<00:06:25.350> think<00:06:25.380> this<00:06:25.710> is<00:06:25.860> one<00:06:26.039> of

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
like practice and I think this is one of

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.460 
like practice and I think this is one of
those<00:06:26.280> things<00:06:26.610> where<00:06:27.050> judgment<00:06:28.050> makes<00:06:28.289> you<00:06:28.440> a

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
those things where judgment makes you a

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.430 
those things where judgment makes you a
lot<00:06:28.680> better<00:06:29.010> as<00:06:29.330> I<00:06:30.330> went<00:06:30.510> along<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:31.020> more<00:06:31.289> that

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
lot better as I went along the more that

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.589 
lot better as I went along the more that
I<00:06:31.500> did<00:06:31.860> the<00:06:32.100> better<00:06:32.340> I<00:06:32.460> started<00:06:32.760> to<00:06:33.000> understand

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
I did the better I started to understand

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.690 
I did the better I started to understand
how<00:06:33.780> the<00:06:33.840> device<00:06:34.200> works<00:06:34.500> but<00:06:35.220> now<00:06:35.370> I'm<00:06:35.490> just

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
how the device works but now I'm just

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.640 
how the device works but now I'm just
using<00:06:36.150> the<00:06:36.419> drum<00:06:36.720> sander<00:06:36.960> to<00:06:37.200> take<00:06:37.410> some<00:06:37.620> of

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
using the drum sander to take some of

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:51.549 
using the drum sander to take some of
these<00:06:37.800> ridges<00:06:38.130> away

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:51.559 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:53.869 

honestly<00:06:52.559> it<00:06:52.709> seems<00:06:52.979> like<00:06:53.189> you<00:06:53.309> could<00:06:53.459> do<00:06:53.610> more

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:53.879 
honestly it seems like you could do more

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:55.850 
honestly it seems like you could do more
damage<00:06:54.240> with<00:06:54.629> the<00:06:54.749> drum<00:06:54.990> Center<00:06:55.379> than<00:06:55.559> with

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
damage with the drum Center than with

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.279 
damage with the drum Center than with
the<00:06:56.069> device<00:06:56.399> that<00:06:56.610> I<00:06:56.729> was<00:06:56.909> using<00:06:57.179> this<00:06:58.020> really

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
the device that I was using this really

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.549 
the device that I was using this really
takes<00:06:58.499> some<00:06:58.589> finesse<00:06:59.839> well<00:07:00.839> that<00:07:01.020> was<00:07:01.169> quite<00:07:01.499> a

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:01.559 
takes some finesse well that was quite a

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:04.399 
takes some finesse well that was quite a
learning<00:07:01.770> experience<00:07:02.490> but<00:07:03.270> after<00:07:03.749> some<00:07:04.020> hand

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:04.409 
learning experience but after some hand

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.279 
learning experience but after some hand
sanding<00:07:04.679> it<00:07:04.889> turned<00:07:05.069> out<00:07:05.189> really<00:07:05.429> nicely<00:07:05.699> I

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:06.289 
sanding it turned out really nicely I

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:08.209 
sanding it turned out really nicely I
wish<00:07:07.289> I<00:07:07.439> would<00:07:07.589> have<00:07:07.679> went<00:07:07.770> a<00:07:07.860> little<00:07:08.099> bit

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:08.219 
wish I would have went a little bit

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.010 
wish I would have went a little bit
deeper<00:07:08.520> but<00:07:08.789> I<00:07:08.849> will<00:07:09.089> on<00:07:09.209> the<00:07:09.360> second<00:07:09.749> spoon

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
deeper but I will on the second spoon

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.779 
deeper but I will on the second spoon
which<00:07:10.379> I'm<00:07:10.619> not<00:07:10.889> going<00:07:11.129> to<00:07:11.219> show<00:07:11.429> you<00:07:11.490> until

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:11.789 
which I'm not going to show you until

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.529 
which I'm not going to show you until
it's<00:07:12.059> done<00:07:12.529> but<00:07:13.529> maple<00:07:14.369> does<00:07:14.849> a<00:07:14.879> really<00:07:15.389> nice

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 
it's done but maple does a really nice

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:18.589 
it's done but maple does a really nice
job<00:07:15.839> of<00:07:15.899> sanding<00:07:16.789> you<00:07:17.789> can<00:07:17.969> get<00:07:18.089> it<00:07:18.209> like<00:07:18.389> a

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 
job of sanding you can get it like a

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:20.469 
job of sanding you can get it like a
piece<00:07:18.869> of<00:07:19.020> glass<00:07:19.169> if<00:07:19.559> you<00:07:19.679> have<00:07:19.800> the<00:07:19.919> patience

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 
piece of glass if you have the patience

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:22.939 
piece of glass if you have the patience
but<00:07:21.479> because<00:07:21.749> this<00:07:21.959> is<00:07:22.110> taking<00:07:22.409> so<00:07:22.559> long<00:07:22.589> I'm

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:22.949 
but because this is taking so long I'm

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:24.529 
but because this is taking so long I'm
going<00:07:23.069> to<00:07:23.129> end<00:07:23.279> this<00:07:23.459> video<00:07:23.699> now<00:07:23.879> and<00:07:24.089> make<00:07:24.509> a

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 
going to end this video now and make a
