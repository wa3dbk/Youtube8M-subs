in kind of a white box form and then

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.869 
in kind of a white box form and then
figuring<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.039> play<00:00:53.190> spaces<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.640> wanted

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to use out of that will be the most

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.779 
to use out of that will be the most
interesting<00:00:55.379> areas<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.070> play<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.579> the

this<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> really<00:01:08.310> good<00:01:08.460> opportunity<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
this is a really good opportunity to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.649 
this is a really good opportunity to
really<00:01:09.540> tell<00:01:09.780> something<00:01:10.170> special<00:01:11.659> like

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
really tell something special like

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.740 
really tell something special like
that's<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.200> right

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
that's not right

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.230 
that's not right
get<00:01:13.930> out

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.999 

this<00:01:17.240> time<00:01:17.450> around<00:01:17.570> I<00:01:17.840> feel<00:01:17.869> like<00:01:18.140> it's<00:01:18.829> been

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
this time around I feel like it's been

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.380 
this time around I feel like it's been
identified<00:01:19.549> that<00:01:19.700> there<00:01:19.759> are<00:01:20.000> these<00:01:20.180> side

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
identified that there are these side

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.789

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
missions that you're going to go out try

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.980 
missions that you're going to go out try
to<00:01:21.860> accomplish<00:01:22.250> owl<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.659> rest<00:01:23.869> of<00:01:23.899> the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
to accomplish owl and the rest of the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.630 
to accomplish owl and the rest of the
group's<00:01:24.229> put<00:01:24.470> together<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:24.950> escape<00:01:25.369> plan

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
group's put together this escape plan

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.850 
group's put together this escape plan
but<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.329> point<00:01:26.600> is<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.810> get<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.229> parts<00:01:27.590> and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
but the point is to get the parts and

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.800 
but the point is to get the parts and
assemble<00:01:28.430> this<00:01:28.549> plane<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.149> they<00:01:29.270> can<00:01:29.420> get<00:01:29.509> off

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
assemble this plane so they can get off

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.710 
assemble this plane so they can get off
