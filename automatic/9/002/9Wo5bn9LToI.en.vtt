but yeah yeah we're just sort of
recreational<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.950> leisure<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.640> you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
recreational we know just leisure if you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
and things like that but how it works is

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.550 
and things like that but how it works is
you<00:01:44.460> install<00:01:45.119> some<00:01:45.509> metal<00:01:45.960> device<00:01:46.200> onto<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
you install some metal device onto the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.889 
you install some metal device onto the
spokes<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.070> wheels<00:01:47.250> magnet<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> think<00:01:48.450> magnet

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
spokes the wheels magnet I think magnet

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.660 
spokes the wheels magnet I think magnet
yeah<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.979> spins<00:01:50.250> around<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
yeah then that spins around with the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.609 
yeah then that spins around with the
wheels<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.180> hits<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.899> receiver<00:01:52.409> here

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
wheels and it hits this receiver here

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.149 
wheels and it hits this receiver here
