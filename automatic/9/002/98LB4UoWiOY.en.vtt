00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:21.560
 shit I run and actually should 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:28.039
 what's going on here is the show 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.039
 hello you fail or are you doing that 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.640
 I 'll do it 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.850
 always away from the place ok 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.829
 yes that was willi he probably will 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:51.040
 soon to be absurd 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:53.949
 and yes I was in the last 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.019
 thousand animations often asked 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.089
 if I could not make a making-of 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.129
 why an animation is created and 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.809
 how it looks behind the scenes 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.210
 I would really like to do that 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.899
 but my computer has currently not 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.000
 enough computing power around that 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.470
 to run an animation program and 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.830
 at the same time on the admission program 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.429
 for desktop and he creates at the moment 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.410
 Not 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:22.740
 but as soon as I calculate what the year 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.660
 or maybe someday it will happen 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.979
 if I would like to 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.580
 to show something like this is possible 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:34.920
 Unfortunately, at the moment it does not say 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.920
 subscribers to such 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.340
 we have 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:48.820
 I meanwhile believe 2500 meters simon 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:50.200
 the simon has 2700 subscribers and had 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.170
 Do not think you have us in vain 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.829
 Subscribe or I'll mike 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.659
 We do not speak weekly 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.960
 can somehow produce something 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.810
 that is difficult with maxi because he rad 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.960
 work and oars and almost everything 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.960
 any time that with a short time to me 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.480
 and I had a look maybe 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.460
 I am happy with others that I too 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.220
 Something that produces at least that 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.830
 once a week expand a video 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.210
 and so you also the update per 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.050
 Unfortunately, animation has always been relative 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.370
 long what you do not do it anymore 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.200
 five minutes and then you invite to 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.430
 but is not working 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.220
 maybe if other friends of mine 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.180
 sometimes learn their 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.900
 then maybe we can even 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.400
 upload an animation 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.640
 that's what it was to me 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.140
 maybe not even one 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:59.970
 here I come again we want 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:02.480
 So we think it's cool and that 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.480
 subscribed 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.580
 was it different? 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.430
