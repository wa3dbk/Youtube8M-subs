00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.880 
different kettle of fish really anybody
that's<00:02:34.599> closely<00:02:35.080> involved<00:02:35.440> with<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.709> Melbourne

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
that's closely involved with a Melbourne

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.130 
that's closely involved with a Melbourne
Cup<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.910> doesn't<00:02:37.269> get<00:02:37.330> nervous<00:02:37.569> it's

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
probably time for them to think about

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.309 
probably time for them to think about
doing<00:02:39.670> something<00:02:39.970> else<00:02:40.180> it's<00:02:40.930> such<00:02:41.200> an

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
doing something else it's such an

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.509 
doing something else it's such an
important<00:02:41.769> race<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.310> means<00:02:42.579> so<00:02:42.819> much<00:02:42.849> to<00:02:43.390> a

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
important race it means so much to a

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.789 
important race it means so much to a
very<00:02:45.519> being<00:02:45.879> Australian<00:02:46.599> I<00:02:46.750> think<00:02:46.989> that<00:02:47.680> it

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
very being Australian I think that it

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:58.440 
very being Australian I think that it
needs<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.069> be<00:02:48.160> broadcast<00:02:48.670> properly<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:58.269> great

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
needs to be broadcast properly the great

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.150 
needs to be broadcast properly the great
thing<00:02:58.629> about<00:02:58.660> calling<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.319> Melbourne<00:02:59.620> cab<00:02:59.859> is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
thing about calling the Melbourne cab is

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.250 
thing about calling the Melbourne cab is
that<00:03:00.879> you<00:03:01.120> become<00:03:01.269> involved<00:03:01.660> in<00:03:01.900> something

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
that you become involved in something

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.380 
that you become involved in something
that<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:02.950> important<00:03:03.609> to<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.209> many

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
that is so important to so many

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.839 
that is so important to so many
Australians<00:03:05.250> jockeys<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.430> trainers<00:03:06.760> and

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
Australians jockeys and trainers and

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.360 
Australians jockeys and trainers and
owners<00:03:06.940> can<00:03:07.329> feel<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.720> but<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.500> race<00:03:08.799> caller<00:03:09.069> can

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
owners can feel it but a race caller can

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.539 
owners can feel it but a race caller can
also<00:03:09.579> and<00:03:10.170> when<00:03:11.170> you're<00:03:11.290> racing<00:03:11.680> tragic<00:03:12.099> like

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
also and when you're racing tragic like

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.330 
also and when you're racing tragic like
most<00:03:12.760> race<00:03:12.970> quarters<00:03:13.359> are<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:14.440> be<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.950> little

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
most race quarters are to be a little

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.030 
most race quarters are to be a little
part<00:03:15.579> of<00:03:15.849> history<00:03:16.420> unfolding<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.349> telling

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
part of history unfolding and telling

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.900 
part of history unfolding and telling
the<00:03:18.130> world<00:03:18.160> about<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.760> that's<00:03:19.180> pretty<00:03:19.660> special
