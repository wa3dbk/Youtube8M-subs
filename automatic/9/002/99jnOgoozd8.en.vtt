00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.980 
well howdy y'all it's been a day or two
since<00:00:03.449> I've<00:00:03.750> made<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.410> video<00:00:04.670> and<00:00:05.670> I've<00:00:06.540> added<00:00:06.750> a

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
since I've made a video and I've added a

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.720 
since I've made a video and I've added a
a<00:00:07.220> carbon<00:00:08.220> fiber<00:00:08.460> dash<00:00:09.030> kit<00:00:09.389> inside<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.200> Stang

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
a carbon fiber dash kit inside the Stang

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.780 
a carbon fiber dash kit inside the Stang
and<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.880> looks<00:00:12.030> like<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> little<00:00:13.790> little

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
and it looks like a little little

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.340 
and it looks like a little little
boo-boo<00:00:15.150> there<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.750> looks<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> little

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
boo-boo there it looks like a little

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.609 
boo-boo there it looks like a little
indention<00:00:16.740> anyway<00:00:17.960> other<00:00:18.960> than<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.380> that

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
indention anyway other than that that

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.700 
indention anyway other than that that
came<00:00:19.920> out<00:00:20.070> pretty<00:00:20.220> nice

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.000 

hope<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.400> not<00:00:23.460> overkill<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.710> I<00:00:25.710> don't<00:00:25.920> know

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
hope it's not overkill and I don't know

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.859 
hope it's not overkill and I don't know
how<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.279> video<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.060> show<00:00:27.269> up<00:00:27.449> inside

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
how the video is going to show up inside

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.950 
how the video is going to show up inside
the<00:00:28.050> car<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:28.820> this<00:00:29.820> camera<00:00:30.269> doesn't<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.720> real

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the car here this camera doesn't do real

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.900 
the car here this camera doesn't do real
good<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.410> low-light<00:00:36.140> anyway<00:00:37.520> so<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.640> got<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
good with low-light anyway so we got the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.470 
good with low-light anyway so we got the
carbon<00:00:39.270> fiber<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.840> course<00:00:41.239> center<00:00:42.239> part

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
carbon fiber on the course center part

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.340 
carbon fiber on the course center part
there<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.620> console<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:46.500> all<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:48.170> even<00:00:49.170> as

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
there the console and all that even as

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.639 
there the console and all that even as
carbon<00:00:49.920> fiber<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:51.140> on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.350> steering

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
carbon fiber on the on the steering

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.549 
carbon fiber on the on the steering
wheel<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.390> it's<00:00:57.390> gonna<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.660> hard<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:58.230> but

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
wheel and it's gonna be hard to see but

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.670 
wheel and it's gonna be hard to see but
right<00:01:00.440> there<00:01:01.440> around<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> light<00:01:02.010> switch<00:01:03.680> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
right there around the light switch the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.490 
right there around the light switch the
door<00:01:04.890> panel<00:01:08.990> that's<00:01:09.990> about<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:12.350> pretty<00:01:13.350> easy

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
door panel that's about it pretty easy

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.840 
door panel that's about it pretty easy
installation<00:01:14.659> what's<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.900> stuff<00:01:16.170> sticks<00:01:16.850> it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
installation what's that stuff sticks it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.700 
installation what's that stuff sticks it
sure<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.240> hard<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.840> get<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.470> want<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
sure is hard to get up if you want to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.200 
sure is hard to get up if you want to
reposition<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.610> got<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.970> careful
