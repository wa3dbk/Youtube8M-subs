00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.650
 leave 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.020
 it ramps up gradually 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.880
 is in the phase still or in charge 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.420
 still a little bit since the goal 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.640
 with fred aubert was precisely fifteen 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.460
 days of heavy work here on earth 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.059
 fountain to be able to arrive in canada 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.290
 and is having to worry about 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.290
 the athletic aspect 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.520
 the hen exit the first of 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.680
 things that we will put as objective 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.259
 but here it is necessary to be ambitious I 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.930
 think it is essential to target the 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.360
 last square we have good players 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.799
 with experience without neglecting the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.979
 teams that are in front of us we're going 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.700
 have to show heart is still 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.700
 the champions of europe 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.410
 well there is a good atmosphere and 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.640
 works well and prom in the image of the 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.420
 session should be done there it was 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.310
 quite intensive 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.490
 so we continue to work well for 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.560
 prepare to return to the competition 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.410
 the other teams will wait for us 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.820
 but we try not to put ourselves 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.700
 to necessarily pressure we will play 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.340
 as we know how to do it 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.690
 here we go we are not going 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.930
 try not to fall into the trap 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.080
 of ease and say that every game 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.680
 has its truth so we'll all give it all 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.680
 every game 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.330
 but the goal for us is to go 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.110
 as far as possible and well it's 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.490
 inevitably the final 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.490
 that's the end goal
