using<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.849> 19<00:02:09.330> volt<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:09.840> not<00:02:10.050> quite<00:02:10.379> as

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
using the 19 volt it's not quite as

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.900 
using the 19 volt it's not quite as
great<00:02:10.709> as<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.920> originally<00:02:11.099> thought<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.550> was

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
great as I originally thought it was

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.910 
great as I originally thought it was
I<00:02:12.239> tried<00:02:12.900> five<00:02:13.170> different<00:02:13.349> laptop

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
I tried five different laptop

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.500 
I tried five different laptop
two<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.250> which<00:02:14.340> were<00:02:14.400> apple<00:02:14.819> products<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.450> does

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
two of which were apple products it does

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.449 
two of which were apple products it does
not<00:02:15.900> have<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.349> right<00:02:16.500> adapter<00:02:16.800> for<00:02:17.160> Apple

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
not have the right adapter for Apple

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.520 
not have the right adapter for Apple
products<00:02:17.849> also<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.720> tried<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.319> couple

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
products also I tried it on a couple

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.070 
products also I tried it on a couple
Dells<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.130> an<00:02:20.340> HP<00:02:20.520> only<00:02:21.480> one<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.810> them<00:02:21.959> would

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
Dells and an HP only one of them would

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.809 
Dells and an HP only one of them would
actually<00:02:22.140> run<00:02:22.860> off<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.400> power<00:02:23.610> supply

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
actually run off of this power supply

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.490 
actually run off of this power supply
and<00:02:24.150> here's<00:02:24.390> what<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:24.630> think<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.020> problem<00:02:25.200> is

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
and here's what I think the problem is

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.440 
and here's what I think the problem is
it's<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.980> 19<00:02:26.310> volt<00:02:26.489> but<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.670> only<00:02:26.730> pushes<00:02:27.150> three

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
it's a 19 volt but it only pushes three

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.620 
it's a 19 volt but it only pushes three
amps<00:02:27.780> my<00:02:28.440> laptop<00:02:28.890> requires<00:02:29.330> 7.7<00:02:30.330> amps<00:02:30.569> or

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
amps my laptop requires 7.7 amps or

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.910 
amps my laptop requires 7.7 amps or
something<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.319> think<00:02:31.470> that's

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
something like that so I think that's

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.160 
something like that so I think that's
probably<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> issue<00:02:32.610> check<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:33.660> out<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.959> might

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
probably the issue check it out it might

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.420 
probably the issue check it out it might
have<00:02:34.350> your<00:02:34.530> adapter<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.100> doesn't<00:02:35.340> mean

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
have your adapter but it doesn't mean

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.559 
have your adapter but it doesn't mean
it's<00:02:35.520> necessarily<00:02:35.610> going<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.030> work<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.330> kind

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
it's necessarily going to work it's kind

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.090 
it's necessarily going to work it's kind
of<00:02:36.630> one<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.900> downsides<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.680> difference

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
of one of the downsides the difference

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.580 
of one of the downsides the difference
between<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.459> X<00:02:38.610> P<00:02:38.910> 1<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.330> X<00:02:39.540> P<00:02:39.780> 3<00:02:40.110> for<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.410> most

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
between the X P 1 and X P 3 for the most

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.490 
between the X P 1 and X P 3 for the most
part<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.220> X<00:02:41.400> P<00:02:41.610> 3<00:02:41.910> does<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:42.300> have<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.170> if

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
part the X P 3 does not have this so if

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.870 
part the X P 3 does not have this so if
that's<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.890> concern<00:02:44.040> or<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.519> don't<00:02:44.640> care

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
that's a concern or you don't care

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.100 
that's a concern or you don't care
you're<00:02:45.090> not<00:02:45.180> gonna<00:02:45.300> use<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.660> for<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.900> purpose

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
you're not gonna use it for that purpose

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.530 
you're not gonna use it for that purpose
go<00:02:46.650> ahead<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:46.950> save<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.280> money<00:02:47.430> by<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.850> X<00:02:48.120> P<00:02:48.269> 3

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
