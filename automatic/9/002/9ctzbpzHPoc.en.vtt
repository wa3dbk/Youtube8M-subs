00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.830
 and signal music as you understand 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:19.350
 what is insight insight is it like u 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:24.449
 man when there is some need 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.710
 or problem and here are the insights and then 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.830
 have he beats roughly speaking on this 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.160
 problems or think of it so that the button 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.590
 would hurt a man that it was about him 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.640
 that's what he needs him now 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.910
 principle yes it is rather but it is not quite 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.110
 the problem is just some kind of observation 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.800
 in this observation of human behavior 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.460
 and maybe this is the observation of the behavior 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.350
 maybe this is watching the whole house 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.409
 no window was range okay just thats 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.610
 last teaches us to use inside we 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.010
 when they discussed this site with hits 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.390
 about animals and the site at the cat owner 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.490
 Type I bought cats this thing for 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.130
 scratching yes she's not rare anyway 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.659
 a thing well i'm lying i'm like her 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.880
 I use this in principle, what is the secret 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.060
 and the site that is a certain group 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.070
 people are pretty narrow she wears it not 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.049
 maybe about all well, that is, maybe 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.530
 well, where to give a category in the summer for 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.590
 guys 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.460
 for there catmen for there pilots for 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.430
 there is a whip like something like this 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.990
 some kind of observation that is 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.369
 I don’t know if we’ll find out right away 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.549
 cool site about music let's inside 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.520
 this may be me before there 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.170
 go somewhere I download 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.170
 so now the buildup 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.450
 well here for example before you exit 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.189
 at home I wait until my song is there I do not know 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.090
 it seems to load into the phone and then I 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:13.040
 I go out to walk down the street 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.920
 the track is waiting for it to boot from 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.930
 wai-fay 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.760
 home there I do not know a couple of songs and then 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.650
 go to the subway here to catch them 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.569
 listen well that's probably mine 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.769
 observation is not I did this here 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.660
 watching as if inside 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:32.630
 and how to use it and then and then 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.430
 already creatives on this site are building 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.470
 some kind of creative 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.860
 i.e. this is either you somehow beat 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.290
 there is if i'm in print i will see this as 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.769
 I would see something in 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.480
 print 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.019
 tells me that dude doesn't 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.209
 need more there to expect it in wi-fay 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.910
 wait for that song to load there 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.049
 porch stand it to you there 4g and 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.579
 Sim card hold here now just 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.019
 was born 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.180
 practically no provost fm. but like 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.060
 Well, as if there is an inside observation that 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.910
 here I am before you go out and there to the subway 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.220
 when I went to the subway in Moscow 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.829
 waited while we download this track to 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.799
 wai-fay and here are three minutes while i go she 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.139
 It is then playing from last.fm muzzle 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.750
 take there let's say I there before 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:24.380
 download sit it claim to new 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.810
 listen well for example well for example i 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.180
 today there was late for work because 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.739
 I thought that to listen to me today bye 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.260
 going to work in the Urals 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:38.510
 Yes, for example inside and we would then 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.880
 that is, last.fm roughly decides 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.650
 This problem because he himself will indicate and 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.069
 It seems the type is a trap 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.920
 yes yes yes this is the observation of the inside 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.319
 then you do not know there in print or 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.720
 somewhere else or in there and on the radio or looking 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.430
 int and creative slogan like this 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.560
 you warm up the situation if i 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.239
 really doing these 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.389
 really late for work because 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.720
 that I, well, that is, the songs downloaded the phone 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:08.629
 I do not know such a blind where this is all 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.340
 devils here you understand this feeling 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.590
 she only I will not have it for everyone 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.090
 This is only for those who appas 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.299
 the donor 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.090
 but this table will not be understood at all and then 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.880
 You can make different insights of those who 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:26.470
 late who is still comfortable well something yes 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.990
 and then it starts at once so that 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.830
 more consistently went well and as if 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.180
 if earlier it was possible to run 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.419
 Well, the spirit of a new example alla there 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.919
 Pugacheva yes there is a singer for the whole of Russia 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.479
 who all who listened to this now 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.210
 it is impossible now 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.250
 all divided into small pieces 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.260
 segment segment here on niches and so 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.960
 further so now but why dance and 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.540
 for here it is slight when categories on 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.830
 which you understand very well then 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.419
 there is no longer able to take amru pores 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.910
 tell someone matty 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.410
 skinny and i need to come up here everyone and 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.660
 say that these handy programmers 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.780
 specially made specially cooked there 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.419
 with by the rules there binary code conditionally 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.979
 this doctor is for housewives everyone 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.010
 come up and tell everyone that this 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.169
 for you guys and so here's a dead body 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.600
 weapons in the shout all because they arut all 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.380
 already visually this is more accurate as it is 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.940
 visual you are just a noise like that 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.639
 He is engaged in women’s website and 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.620
 say that you and I, I know that you 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.620
 need to unscrew
