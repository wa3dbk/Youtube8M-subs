down significantly for your price per
gram<00:01:59.240> and<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.899> deliver<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.290> cake<00:02:01.740> for

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
gram and so you can deliver a cake for

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.039 
gram and so you can deliver a cake for
like<00:02:02.219> twenty<00:02:02.520> nine<00:02:02.670> cents<00:02:03.119> which<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.479> pretty

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
like twenty nine cents which is pretty

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.809 
like twenty nine cents which is pretty
reasonable<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:07.259> how<00:02:07.920> much<00:02:08.099> would<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.670> really

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
reasonable so how much would you really

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.600 
reasonable so how much would you really
be<00:02:09.119> saving<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.489> be

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
be saving there so it's it's going to be

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.920 
be saving there so it's it's going to be
a<00:02:11.640> range

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
a range

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
um from how much you saved but basically

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.589 
um from how much you saved but basically
you're<00:02:19.170> you're<00:02:19.590> you're<00:02:20.459> saving<00:02:21.060> anywhere

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
you're you're you're saving anywhere

you're you're you're saving anywhere
from<00:02:21.930> about<00:02:22.200> 38<00:02:22.859> cents<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:24.299> about<00:02:25.170> ninety<00:02:26.010> six

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
from about 38 cents to about ninety six

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
cents per keg when you when you we use

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.379 
cents per keg when you when you we use
the<00:02:32.489> paintball<00:02:33.359> tank<00:02:33.599> price<00:02:34.469> for<00:02:34.980> co2<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:36.299> of

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
the paintball tank price for co2 but of

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.420 
the paintball tank price for co2 but of
course<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.810> leaves<00:02:37.019> out<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.319> setup<00:02:37.920> costs

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
course that leaves out the setup costs

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.349 
course that leaves out the setup costs
so<00:02:38.579> let's<00:02:38.819> look<00:02:38.939> at<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.180> setup<00:02:39.510> costs<00:02:39.750> now<00:02:41.359> so

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
so let's look at the setup costs now so

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.300 
so let's look at the setup costs now so
if<00:02:42.750> we<00:02:42.870> look<00:02:42.900> at<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:43.170> setup<00:02:43.500> costs<00:02:43.950> for<00:02:44.280> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
if we look at the setup costs for the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.449 
if we look at the setup costs for the
paintball<00:02:44.819> tank<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:46.109> to<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.340> to

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
paintball tank you have to you have to

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.159 
paintball tank you have to you have to
get<00:02:47.639> yourself<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:50.120> regulator<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.389> at<00:02:51.930> Harbor

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
get yourself a regulator and at Harbor

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.640 
get yourself a regulator and at Harbor
Freight<00:02:52.379> that<00:02:52.439> comes<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:53.129> at<00:02:53.220> about<00:02:53.419> $42<00:02:54.650> you

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
Freight that comes in at about $42 you

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.129 
Freight that comes in at about $42 you
also<00:02:55.919> have<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.189> get<00:02:56.370> yourself<00:02:56.870> something<00:02:57.870> to

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
also have to get yourself something to

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.959 
also have to get yourself something to
connect<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.829> paintball<00:02:59.459> tank<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.939> the

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
connect the paintball tank to the

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.270 
connect the paintball tank to the
regulator<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.379> is<00:03:01.469> a<00:03:01.530> wild<00:03:01.829> guess<00:03:02.010> of

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
regulator and this is a wild guess of

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.470 
regulator and this is a wild guess of
ten<00:03:02.459> dollars<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.909> don't<00:03:03.090> know<00:03:03.180> what<00:03:03.299> that<00:03:03.329> is

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
ten dollars I don't know what that is

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.740 
ten dollars I don't know what that is
exactly<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.319> then<00:03:04.919> if<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:06.000> need<00:03:06.329> then<00:03:06.629> you

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
exactly and then if you need then you

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.720 
exactly and then if you need then you
have<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.959> connect<00:03:07.260> your<00:03:07.590> your<00:03:07.889> regulator<00:03:08.400> to

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
have to connect your your regulator to

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.640 
have to connect your your regulator to
your<00:03:08.909> tap<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> draft<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:10.169> figured<00:03:10.439> that<00:03:10.560> it's

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
your tap a draft and I figured that it's

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.199 
your tap a draft and I figured that it's
about<00:03:10.760> $35<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.239> coming<00:03:12.989> up<00:03:13.139> to<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.379> total<00:03:13.709> of

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
about $35 so coming up to a total of

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.659 
about $35 so coming up to a total of
eighty<00:03:15.209> seven<00:03:15.689> dollars<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.260> get<00:03:16.469> um<00:03:16.709> get<00:03:17.310> set

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
eighty seven dollars to get um get set

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.080 
eighty seven dollars to get um get set
up<00:03:17.699> with<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.540> paintball<00:03:19.199> tank<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:20.430> the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
up with the paintball tank so the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.969 
up with the paintball tank so the
question<00:03:21.269> then<00:03:21.540> becomes<00:03:21.959> is<00:03:22.229> that<00:03:22.440> how<00:03:22.919> does

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979 
question then becomes is that how does

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:26.059 
question then becomes is that how does
that<00:03:23.129> work<00:03:23.340> out<00:03:23.579> from<00:03:23.849> a<00:03:24.000> from<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.169> how<00:03:25.889> long

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
that work out from a from a how long

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.640 
that work out from a from a how long
would<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.250> take<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.459> break<00:03:26.729> even<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.659> how<00:03:28.590> many

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
would it take to break even so how many

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.550 
would it take to break even so how many
kegs<00:03:29.010> would<00:03:29.189> you<00:03:29.310> have<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.519> pour<00:03:30.560> before

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
kegs would you have to pour before

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.580 
kegs would you have to pour before
you're<00:03:31.769> even<00:03:32.419> with<00:03:33.419> just<00:03:33.689> using<00:03:33.930> cartridges

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
you're even with just using cartridges

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.379 
you're even with just using cartridges
and<00:03:34.799> i<00:03:35.519> used<00:03:35.849> the<00:03:36.299> expected<00:03:37.019> cost<00:03:37.970> savings<00:03:38.970> per

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
and i used the expected cost savings per

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.520 
and i used the expected cost savings per
keg<00:03:39.689> of<00:03:39.930> 63<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.829> point<00:03:41.430> two<00:03:41.579> cents<00:03:42.109> per<00:03:43.109> keg

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
keg of 63 and point two cents per keg

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.670 
keg of 63 and point two cents per keg
just<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.790> pick<00:03:45.329> something<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.810> middle<00:03:46.079> if

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
just to pick something in the middle if

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.999 
just to pick something in the middle if
you<00:03:46.769> bought<00:03:47.220> more<00:03:47.519> cartridges<00:03:48.290> at<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.349> lesser

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:50.009 
you bought more cartridges at a lesser

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.759 
you bought more cartridges at a lesser
price<00:03:50.720> you're<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:51.930> know<00:03:52.019> saving<00:03:52.379> serket

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
price you're you know saving serket

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.909 
price you're you know saving serket
would<00:03:52.919> be<00:03:53.069> lower<00:03:53.819> or<00:03:54.150> if<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.259> bought<00:03:55.530> fewer

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
would be lower or if you bought fewer

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.920 
would be lower or if you bought fewer
your<00:03:56.459> savings<00:03:56.849> you<00:03:56.879> can<00:03:56.939> be<00:03:57.299> higher<00:03:57.509> but<00:03:57.750> i

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
your savings you can be higher but i

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.770 
your savings you can be higher but i
just<00:03:58.290> use<00:03:58.439> 63<00:03:58.919> cents<00:03:59.189> for<00:03:59.370> this<00:03:59.519> analysis<00:04:00.209> so

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
just use 63 cents for this analysis so

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.259 
just use 63 cents for this analysis so
um<00:04:01.139> and<00:04:01.949> then<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.400> course<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:02.819> have<00:04:03.150> to

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
um and then of course that you have to

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.819 
um and then of course that you have to
factor<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.019> number<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.349> kegs<00:04:04.590> you

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
factor in the number of kegs you

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.999 
factor in the number of kegs you
actually<00:04:05.449> use<00:04:06.449> in<00:04:06.659> a<00:04:06.689> year<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.319> then<00:04:07.769> how<00:04:07.949> many

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:08.009 
actually use in a year and then how many

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.210 
actually use in a year and then how many
years<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.579> break<00:04:08.729> even<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.769> number<00:04:11.129> of

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
years to break even so so the number of

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.219 
years to break even so so the number of
kegs<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.729> break<00:04:11.939> even<00:04:12.150> turns<00:04:12.540> out<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.959> be<00:04:12.989> is

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
kegs to break even turns out to be is

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.599 
kegs to break even turns out to be is
about<00:04:13.439> 137<00:04:14.370> kegs<00:04:14.879> under<00:04:15.750> my<00:04:15.870> analysis<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.650> if

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
about 137 kegs under my analysis and if

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.899 
about 137 kegs under my analysis and if
if<00:04:18.389> you<00:04:18.780> brew<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.049> five<00:04:19.380> gallon<00:04:19.680> batch<00:04:20.370> every

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
if you brew a five gallon batch every

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.890 
if you brew a five gallon batch every
month<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.900> would<00:04:22.079> be<00:04:22.260> 36

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
month that would be 36

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.219 
month that would be 36
a<00:04:23.930> year<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.360> then<00:04:26.360> so<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:26.840> would<00:04:26.990> make<00:04:27.169> it

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
a year and then so that would make it
