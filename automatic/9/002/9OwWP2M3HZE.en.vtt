00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.010 
it and I think you just have to what
makes<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.369> different<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.449> host<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.900> mean

makes it different is the host I mean

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.779 
makes it different is the host I mean
the<00:00:19.080> format<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.560> basically<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.130> format<00:00:20.550> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the format is basically the format and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.970 
the format is basically the format and
the<00:00:20.850> host<00:00:21.000> kind<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.720> dictates<00:00:22.470> what<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.800> show

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the host kind of dictates what the show

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.080 
the host kind of dictates what the show
is<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.310> you'll<00:00:23.430> be<00:00:23.580> different<00:00:23.939> because

Kenyan<00:01:44.920> one<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.160> swapped<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.759> out<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.590> we<00:01:47.920> just

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
Kenyan one I swapped it out but we just

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.889 
Kenyan one I swapped it out but we just
want<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.399> bring<00:01:48.520> that<00:01:48.640> energy<00:01:48.940> that<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.450> do<00:01:49.660> so

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
want to bring that energy that you do so

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.719 
want to bring that energy that you do so
well<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:50.140> mean<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:51.100> have<00:01:51.430> captured

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
well I mean it you you have captured

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.749 
well I mean it you you have captured
this<00:01:52.210> this<00:01:52.570> energy<00:01:53.170> in<00:01:53.530> America<00:01:54.130> that<00:01:54.310> I'd

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
this this energy in America that I'd

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.660 
this this energy in America that I'd
love<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.180> have<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.390> mess
