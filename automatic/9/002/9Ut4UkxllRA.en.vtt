 The admission ticket rate has been robbed of cards 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.880
 Well yeah generally it's something like this 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.140
 Is used 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:51.480
 New product development's we are in that Sanfrecce's and the collaboration this time in this 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.430
 It's actually like this by trying to make a key chain type ticket with a card type 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.740
 Developed 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.890
 To in 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.220
 Actually, yeah I say I was able to these things 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.970
 Mashitaa are doing our 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.190
 ic tag 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:11.020
 What is actually in this is something like this 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:17.109
 It looks like it actually seems that I say in the way like saying the world's smallest class 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.810
 You can do the same thing in this small ic tags exactly the same function as this was our development 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:22.229
 Say 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.560

 It is the best in life 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.350
 Well, first of all, as you can see 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.900
 Small size 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.760
 The main feature is that the size has been reduced 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.020
 This time, the child makes good use of the parable, and such services are attributable to ticket-perot development. 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:11.770
 I used it by all means 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.010
 Once you develop this for our company, the degree of distribution will be good, or it can be used on metal as well 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.240
 After that it has 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.500
 It is strong against heat 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.430
 Above all in the resin has the features such as being able to personality matter molding

 It is used in conventional anti-say ic card 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.140
 When it It is a tag, such as not possible with this is it is this all means to our development 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.200
 Say 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:44.300
 This ultra-compact ic tag will expand the use with new ideas 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.300
 It is also possible already embedded in what the ring or to have been commercialized

 Recent good with wearable to be said 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.720
 There is a word that the device is exactly what these things really wear 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:01.830
 8 ticket after Toka is a Well in the future 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.110
 For example, such a thing is annoyance of a house, and it is said that it can also be settled 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.480
 The 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:11.840
 Because it is expected as a market 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:16.569
 For us, small ic tags that other companies like this don't make until now 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.569
 If you are making a product that you could not do 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:26.290
 The j-League's first cutting-edge technology was used 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:29.910
