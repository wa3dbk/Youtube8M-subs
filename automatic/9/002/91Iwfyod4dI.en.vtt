D and you notice that there are some X's
and<00:01:35.939> O's<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.299> top<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.750> XS<00:01:37.110> mean<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.619> do

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
too much of a difference if you do but

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.819 
too much of a difference if you do but
generally<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.170> need<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.500> play<00:01:43.649> those

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
generally you don't need to play those

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.920 
generally you don't need to play those
strings<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.729> O<00:01:44.759> stands<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
strings and the O stands for that you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.889 
strings and the O stands for that you
are<00:01:46.490> it's<00:01:47.490> an<00:01:47.640> open<00:01:47.970> note<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.360> lets<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> play

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it so basically this is what the D chord

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.730 
it so basically this is what the D chord
looks<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.540> you're<00:01:51.750> gonna<00:01:51.840> put<00:01:52.110> your<00:01:52.320> finger

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
looks like you're gonna put your finger

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.740 
looks like you're gonna put your finger
here<00:01:53.720> here<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.439> then<00:01:55.829> here<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.450> then<00:01:57.450> it

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
here here and then here and then it

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.450 
here here and then here and then it
should<00:01:57.960> looks<00:01:58.229> very<00:01:58.710> similar<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> picture

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
should looks very similar to the picture

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.249 
should looks very similar to the picture
that<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.180> here<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.930> your<00:02:01.110> D

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that you see here so this is your D

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.050 
that you see here so this is your D
chord<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.799> then<00:02:02.130> how<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.369> test<00:02:02.700> your<00:02:02.880> D<00:02:03.030> chord

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
chord and then how you test your D chord

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.999 
chord and then how you test your D chord
is<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> hit<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:04.079> string<00:02:04.380> at<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> time<00:02:04.799> very

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
is to hit it one string at a time very

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:14.559 
is to hit it one string at a time very
slowly<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.210> hit<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:07.829> fourth<00:02:08.819> string

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.390 

okay<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.230> what<00:02:15.769> you<00:02:15.860> want<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.040> do<00:02:16.129> is<00:02:16.250> when

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
okay so what you want to do is when

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.800 
okay so what you want to do is when
you're<00:02:16.519> playing<00:02:16.670> these<00:02:16.790> strings<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.329> to<00:02:17.569> be

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
you're playing these strings is to be

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.280 
you're playing these strings is to be
able<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.579> roll<00:02:19.579> your<00:02:19.730> finger<00:02:20.120> over<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.840> note

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
able to roll your finger over the note

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.709 
able to roll your finger over the note
and<00:02:21.530> then<00:02:22.159> hit<00:02:22.459> one<00:02:22.640> string<00:02:22.969> at<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.180> time<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:23.689> you

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
and then hit one string at a time so you

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.970 
and then hit one string at a time so you
can<00:02:23.959> see<00:02:24.140> if<00:02:24.260> you're<00:02:24.379> hitting<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.650> correctly

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
can see if you're hitting it correctly

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.250 
can see if you're hitting it correctly
now<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:25.909> would<00:02:26.090> be<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.329> incorrect<00:02:26.780> way<00:02:26.989> of

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
now this would be the incorrect way of

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.050 
now this would be the incorrect way of
pushing<00:02:27.859> it<00:02:27.980> down<00:02:28.129> and<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.489> how<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.969> would

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
pushing it down and this is how it would

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.610 
pushing it down and this is how it would
incorrectly<00:02:29.569> sound<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:33.140> it's<00:02:33.260> kind<00:02:33.439> of<00:02:33.470> knob

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
incorrectly sound so it's kind of knob

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.830 
incorrectly sound so it's kind of knob
so<00:02:33.829> you<00:02:33.920> want<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.159> push<00:02:34.819> it<00:02:34.970> down<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.329> readjust

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
so you want to push it down and readjust

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.789 
so you want to push it down and readjust
and<00:02:35.989> make<00:02:36.079> sure<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.319> you're<00:02:36.470> playing<00:02:36.650> each

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
the two into the one so remember it goes

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:38.890 
the two into the one so remember it goes

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.210 
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 and then you
would<00:03:39.020> do<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.290> three<00:03:39.500> times<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.980> then<00:03:40.070> two

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
would do that three times and then two

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.479

wherever<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.810> chord<00:04:27.110> is<00:04:27.260> that's<00:04:27.560> where<00:04:27.860> you

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
wherever the chord is that's where you

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.450 
wherever the chord is that's where you
play<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.460> if<00:04:29.240> it's<00:04:29.630> over<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.200> word<00:04:30.530> then<00:04:31.220> it's

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
play it if it's over that word then it's

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.540 
play it if it's over that word then it's
usually<00:04:31.610> played<00:04:31.940> at<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.150> point<00:04:32.540> in<00:04:32.810> time

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
usually played at that point in time

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.620 
usually played at that point in time
just<00:04:34.550> to<00:04:34.669> kind<00:04:34.790> of<00:04:34.880> give<00:04:35.030> you<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.150> heads<00:04:35.360> up<00:04:35.450> if

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
just to kind of give you a heads up if

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.320 
just to kind of give you a heads up if
you're<00:04:35.810> more<00:04:35.990> mechanical<00:04:36.620> is<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:37.030> D<00:04:38.030> that<00:04:38.270> you

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
you're more mechanical is the D that you

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.080 
you're more mechanical is the D that you
play<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:38.660> play<00:04:38.960> two<00:04:39.080> strums<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:40.130> then<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.850> G

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
play you play two strums and then the G

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.790 
play you play two strums and then the G
you<00:04:41.210> play<00:04:41.390> two<00:04:41.450> strums<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.290> then<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.740> you

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
you play two strums and then the a you

you play two strums and then the a you
play<00:04:43.160> four<00:04:43.460> strums<00:04:43.760> and<00:04:44.150> so<00:04:45.050> then<00:04:45.500> you<00:04:45.680> would

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
play four strums and so then you would

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.040 
play four strums and so then you would
just<00:04:45.860> cycle<00:04:46.310> through<00:04:46.370> that<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:47.120> again<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.750> want

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
just cycle through that and again I want

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.420 
just cycle through that and again I want
to<00:04:48.080> emphasize<00:04:48.229> that<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.919> better<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:49.310> know

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
to emphasize that the better you know

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.190 
to emphasize that the better you know
the<00:04:49.550> song<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:50.000> easier<00:04:50.360> it<00:04:50.450> is<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.570> figure<00:04:51.050> out

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
the song the easier it is to figure out

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.710 
the song the easier it is to figure out
when<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.620> change<00:04:52.160> from<00:04:52.430> chord<00:04:52.760> to<00:04:52.850> chord<00:04:52.970> and

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
when to change from chord to chord and

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.000 
when to change from chord to chord and
we're<00:04:54.229> gonna<00:04:54.350> talk<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.620> little<00:04:54.860> bit<00:04:54.979> about
