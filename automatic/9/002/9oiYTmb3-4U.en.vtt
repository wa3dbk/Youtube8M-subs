00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.559
 so together, welcome here 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.629
 with me in the channel 3 at night with and how 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.570
 you can see I have my new one here 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.490
 Couple of running shoes from ASICS new season 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.510
 new luck with new shoes 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.340
 others are a bit again 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.680
 gone through and accordingly 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.190
 I now brand new the new gel 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.830
 nimbus model 17 brings and we us 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.180
 do not find a very cool color 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.640
 Let's look at each other now 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.920
 how do you see the good piece looks 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.719
 really really cool so totally 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.390
 fashionable current I would say 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.760
 and just a cool design like me 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.469
 find and I could not say no 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:48.050
 gives the tasks as a cool fire red 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.729
 away and yes I'm up for the color 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.469
 decided I think times is something 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.719
 different and still relatively black 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.579
 so very cool 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.469
 yes, if not right now, of course 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.600
 also put on clothes and then I will 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.489
 you show the already small at first 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.280
 laterally from behind from the other 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:12.680
 side speaks the outside front 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.899
 area above and the soli of course too 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.549
 but again on the foot looks and like him 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:21.409
 a little bit in motion 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:25.930
 So does that I show you now the 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.930
 Bresche put on at my highest 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.159
 from the movement really really cool 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.609
 that 's really how you told me 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:43.909
 seller that is really the comfort 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:49.749
 monster is one to say it really 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:52.280
 I really like it very much 

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:54.170
 there is a little knee problem 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.859
 I am plagued by many gram or 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.999
 I hope I have the problems at all 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.399
 that I'm with that a bit 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:04.009
 can compensate 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.130
 and as I definitely do 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.300
 it will, I'm going here of Corexit 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.810
 Of course, I still have it with me 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.780
 ordered the special ones to look for 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.400
 Well padded I still use 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.410
 then the shoe is still one more 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.080
 corner better if the standard so 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.540
 of course always is what because the shoe 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.700
 here in my foot in the biggest 45 and 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.760
 By now I just know he's there 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.810
 fits with me and even the orphan 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.810
 wise of the size ideal 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.830
