00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
now we would have five feet four will be

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.379 
now we would have five feet four will be
four<00:04:58.620> millimeter<00:04:59.010> and<00:04:59.280> one<00:04:59.639> will<00:04:59.820> be<00:04:59.850> three

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.090 
four millimeter and one will be three
millimeter<00:05:03.020> right<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.229> put<00:05:04.410> into<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.800> next

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100
