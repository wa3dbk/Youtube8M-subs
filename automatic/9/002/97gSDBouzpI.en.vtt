and<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.760> go<00:01:03.300> whatever<00:01:03.449> cast<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
and then you can go whatever cast you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.020 
and then you can go whatever cast you
need<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.680> oh<00:01:05.369> you're<00:01:05.729> gonna<00:01:05.820> make<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
need in here oh you're gonna make a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.770 
need in here oh you're gonna make a
sword<00:01:06.360> water<00:01:06.600> anyway<00:01:07.010> you<00:01:08.010> fill<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.780> once

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
sword water anyway you fill it up once

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.050 
sword water anyway you fill it up once
that's<00:01:09.990> done<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.530> stays<00:01:10.979> full<00:01:11.580> because<00:01:11.820> it's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
that's done it stays full because it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.730

fills<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.570> tank<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.150> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
fills up the tank so that is it and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.240 
fills up the tank so that is it and
that's<00:01:36.540> what<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.810> looks<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.650> use<00:01:37.890> I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
that's what it looks like to use I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.160 
that's what it looks like to use I
really<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.329> I've<00:01:39.450> never<00:01:39.600> seen<00:01:39.689> any<00:01:39.900> wants<00:01:40.110> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
really like I've never seen any wants to

haven't<00:01:41.610> seen<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.880> lot<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> people<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.630> things

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
haven't seen a lot of people do things

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
haven't seen a lot of people do things
I'm<00:01:43.079> sure<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.439> not<00:01:43.590> unique<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.729> maybe<00:01:45.060> in

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
I'm sure it's not unique but maybe in

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.510 
I'm sure it's not unique but maybe in
the<00:01:45.360> way<00:01:45.450> I'm<00:01:45.570> doing<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.079> unique<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.860> hope

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the way I'm doing it is unique so hope

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
the way I'm doing it is unique so hope
you<00:01:47.610> guys<00:01:47.670> enjoyed<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:48.540> walk<00:01:48.810> really

you guys enjoyed it and then walk really
quickly<00:01:49.439> they<00:01:49.530> should<00:01:49.680> kind<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.829> show<00:01:50.040> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
quickly they should kind of show you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.520 
quickly they should kind of show you

also to be a line of redstone and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.240 
also to be a line of redstone and
everything<00:02:33.379> would<00:02:33.500> try<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.620> activate<00:02:34.099> at<00:02:34.160> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
everything would try to activate at the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.809 
everything would try to activate at the
same<00:02:34.400> time

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
same time

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.440 
same time
halfway<00:02:35.690> through<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:36.079> switch<00:02:36.650> from<00:02:37.450> fluid

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
halfway through I switch from fluid

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.009 
halfway through I switch from fluid
ducts<00:02:39.040> teff<00:02:40.090> under<00:02:41.090> fluid<00:02:41.390> ducts<00:02:41.569> conduits

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
ducts teff under fluid ducts conduits

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.460 
ducts teff under fluid ducts conduits
and<00:02:42.769> they<00:02:42.920> work<00:02:43.129> much<00:02:43.910> better<00:02:44.200> there's<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.349> lot

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
and they work much better there's a lot

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.300 
and they work much better there's a lot
wasted<00:02:46.010> when<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.340> run<00:02:46.579> a<00:02:46.819> lot<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:48.310> distance

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
wasted when you run a lot of distance

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.890 
wasted when you run a lot of distance
and<00:02:50.060> fluid<00:02:50.480> ducts<00:02:51.220> but<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:53.150> works<00:02:53.329> well<00:02:53.510> and

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
and fluid ducts but it works well and

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.960 
and fluid ducts but it works well and
these<00:02:54.049> are<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.829> a<00:02:54.980> liquid<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.730> have<00:02:55.940> a

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
these are this is a liquid that I have a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.710 
these are this is a liquid that I have a
lot<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.390> I'm<00:02:56.540> not<00:02:56.690> worried<00:02:56.870> about<00:02:56.959> wasting<00:02:57.560> any

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
lot of I'm not worried about wasting any

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.080 
lot of I'm not worried about wasting any
so<00:02:59.720> that's<00:02:59.870> basically<00:03:00.170> how<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.349> works<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.799> I

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
so that's basically how it works and I

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.089 
so that's basically how it works and I
