slushie put your lid back on and the
hard<00:01:44.729> part<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:46.079> you're

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
hard part is now because what you're

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
going to have to do after you've poured

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.910 
going to have to do after you've poured
it<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.659> let<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.990> sit<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.470> two<00:01:49.890> minutes

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it is to let it sit for two minutes

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.249 
it is to let it sit for two minutes
that's<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:50.820> what<00:01:51.450> we're<00:01:51.600> trying<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.049> is

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
that's right what we're trying to do is

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.740 
that's right what we're trying to do is
get<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> freezing<00:01:53.430> reaction<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.570> little

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
get the freezing reaction going a little

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.810 
get the freezing reaction going a little
bit<00:01:54.930> more<00:01:55.110> quickly<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.070> best<00:01:56.369> way<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.610> do

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
bit more quickly and the best way to do

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.789 
bit more quickly and the best way to do
it<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.090> actually<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.899> leave<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.229> alone<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it is actually just to leave it alone so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.740 
it is actually just to leave it alone so
you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.490> leave<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.729> alone<00:01:59.850> by<00:02:00.180> sending<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.659> in

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you can leave it alone by sending it in

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.050 
you can leave it alone by sending it in
your<00:02:00.930> freezer<00:02:01.200> or<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.759> leave<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.969> alone

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
your freezer or you can leave it alone

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
your freezer or you can leave it alone
by<00:02:03.450> setting<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.930> your<00:02:04.049> refrigerator<00:02:04.200> that's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
by setting in your refrigerator that's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.310 
by setting in your refrigerator that's
not<00:02:05.130> quite<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.640> good<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> freezer<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.479> you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
not quite as good as the freezer and you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.900 
not quite as good as the freezer and you
could<00:02:07.500> even<00:02:07.680> let<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.069> alone<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.489> let<00:02:08.789> it

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
could even let it alone and just let it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940 
could even let it alone and just let it
sit<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.179> your<00:02:09.330> counter<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:09.899> two<00:02:10.050> minutes<00:02:10.229> that

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
sit on your counter for two minutes that

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.530 
sit on your counter for two minutes that
will<00:02:11.129> still<00:02:11.370> get<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.640> Trent<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> reaction

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
will still get the Trent the reaction

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.850 
will still get the Trent the reaction
going<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:12.930> we<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.349> cup

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
going so we have a cup

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.860 
going so we have a cup
that<00:02:14.370> has<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.790> fact<00:02:14.970> been<00:02:15.150> sitting<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:15.690> two

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
that has in fact been sitting for two

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.750 
that has in fact been sitting for two
minutes<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.290> what<00:02:17.010> we're<00:02:17.130> going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.310> do<00:02:17.520> is

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760

minutes and what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:18.360> going<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> take<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.840> out<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.200> we're

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
we're going to take it out and we're

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.850 
we're going to take it out and we're
going<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.070> start<00:02:20.250> squeezing<00:02:20.640> now<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:22.590> just

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
going to start squeezing now you just

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.280 
going to start squeezing now you just
squeeze<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.610> cup<00:02:23.820> like<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:25.110> work
