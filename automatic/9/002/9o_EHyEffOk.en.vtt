mineral<00:00:13.620> silicon<00:00:14.549> now<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.599> may<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:15.839> heard

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
mineral silicon now you may have heard

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.400 
mineral silicon now you may have heard
of<00:00:16.080> calcium<00:00:16.800> or<00:00:16.980> magnesium<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:18.330> potassium<00:00:18.779> or

of calcium or magnesium or potassium or
maybe<00:00:19.650> even<00:00:19.920> iodine<00:00:20.760> or<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.970> 10<00:00:21.449> as<00:00:21.600> we<00:00:21.720> call<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
maybe even iodine or I 10 as we call it

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.679 
maybe even iodine or I 10 as we call it
but<00:00:23.160> silicon<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> mineral<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.240> we've

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
but silicon is the mineral that we've

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.929 
but silicon is the mineral that we've
always<00:00:24.930> believed<00:00:25.320> lives<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.920> your<00:00:26.099> nails<00:00:26.519> your

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.189 
we use the mineral calcium to build
strong<00:00:49.590> bones<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.160> teeth<00:00:50.390> we<00:00:51.390> use<00:00:51.629> magnesium

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
strong bones and teeth we use magnesium

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.520 
strong bones and teeth we use magnesium
as<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.149> relaxant<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.899> let<00:00:55.199> me<00:00:55.230> give<00:00:55.379> an<00:00:55.469> example

as a relaxant now let me give an example

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.650 
as a relaxant now let me give an example
say<00:00:56.010> someone<00:00:56.309> stress<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.420> know<00:00:57.539> I'm

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
say someone stress this out you know I'm

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.439 
say someone stress this out you know I'm
going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.840> take<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> magnesium<00:00:58.500> supplement

with dictates the effect it has in the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.830 
with dictates the effect it has in the
body<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:04.650> many<00:01:04.890> people<00:01:05.129> understand<00:01:05.549> this

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
body and not many people understand this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.050 
body and not many people understand this
but<00:01:06.979> you<00:01:07.979> may<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.280> heard<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.520> carbon<00:01:09.030> dioxide

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
but you may have heard of carbon dioxide

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.570 
but you may have heard of carbon dioxide
which<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> deadly<00:01:10.619> poison<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.220> breathe<00:01:11.430> out

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
which is a deadly poison we breathe out

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.359 
which is a deadly poison we breathe out
and<00:01:11.700> now<00:01:11.790> carbon<00:01:12.470> makes<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.650> our<00:01:13.770> world<00:01:14.040> but

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and now carbon makes up our world but

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.539 
and now carbon makes up our world but
you<00:01:14.460> combine<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.030> two<00:01:15.330> oxygen<00:01:15.960> atoms

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
you combine it with two oxygen atoms

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.940 
you combine it with two oxygen atoms
dioxide<00:01:17.549> turns<00:01:18.270> into<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.570> deadly<00:01:18.720> poison<00:01:19.049> well

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
dioxide turns into a deadly poison well

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.760 
dioxide turns into a deadly poison well
what<00:01:20.939> most<00:01:21.210> people<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:21.930> take<00:01:21.960> silicon

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
what most people do is they take silicon

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.980 
what most people do is they take silicon
in<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.220> form<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.460> dioxide<00:01:24.119> silicon<00:01:24.720> dioxide

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
in the form of dioxide silicon dioxide

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.039 
in the form of dioxide silicon dioxide
like<00:01:25.560> carbon<00:01:26.009> dioxide<00:01:26.460> hope<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.570> follow<00:01:27.720> me

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
like carbon dioxide hope you follow me

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.310 
like carbon dioxide hope you follow me
here<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:29.270> with<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.840> believe<00:01:30.869> that's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
here and with what we believe that's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.960 
here and with what we believe that's
acid<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.950> that's<00:01:32.430> probably<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> best

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
acid and that's probably not the best

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.370 
acid and that's probably not the best
thing<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.329> fact<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.780> short<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.110> call<00:01:34.259> it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
thing in fact for short they call it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.749 
thing in fact for short they call it
silicate<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.100> may<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.310> heard<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.430> women<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
silicate you may have heard a women I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.240 
silicate you may have heard a women I
have<00:01:35.880> silica<00:01:36.360> gel<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.619> look<00:01:37.770> at<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.130> we

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
have silica gel so look at so what we

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.740 
have silica gel so look at so what we
need<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.790> need<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.090> silicon<00:01:39.600> but

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
need to do is we need to get silicon but

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.749 
need to do is we need to get silicon but
we<00:01:39.900> want<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.350> want<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.340> form

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
we want it we want to get it in a form

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.139 
we want it we want to get it in a form
this<00:01:42.689> combined<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.320> something<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
this combined with something that is a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.429 
this combined with something that is a
stronger<00:01:45.659> combination<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.259> better

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
stronger combination of better

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.050 
stronger combination of better
combination<00:01:46.740> now<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.640> don't<00:01:47.850> need<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
combination now you don't need to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.969 
combination now you don't need to
understand<00:01:48.479> all<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> technical<00:01:49.500> chemistry

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
understand all the technical chemistry

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.380 
understand all the technical chemistry
obviously<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.399> when<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.759> take<00:01:50.939> things<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.240> can

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
obviously but when we take things we can

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.700

borrow with it with oxygen and hydrogen
we<00:01:53.340> would<00:01:53.520> someone<00:01:53.939> call<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.649> hydroxide<00:01:55.649> but

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
we would someone call it a hydroxide but

bright attractive and strong other thing

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.210 
bright attractive and strong other thing
that<00:02:39.300> I'll<00:02:40.300> say<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:41.170> everything<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.040> do

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
that I'll say is that everything you do

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.830 
that I'll say is that everything you do
for<00:02:42.430> your<00:02:42.520> body<00:02:42.700> makes<00:02:43.510> your<00:02:43.690> eyes<00:02:43.810> look

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
for your body makes your eyes look

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.750 
for your body makes your eyes look
brighter<00:02:44.350> your<00:02:44.560> hair<00:02:44.890> stronger<00:02:45.160> your<00:02:45.460> general

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
brighter your hair stronger your general

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.100 
brighter your hair stronger your general
health<00:02:45.790> as<00:02:46.120> well<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:46.600> definitely<00:02:46.840> recommend

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
health as well so I definitely recommend

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.860 
health as well so I definitely recommend
if<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.010> get<00:02:48.220> skin<00:02:48.490> hair<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.730> nails<00:02:48.870> don't

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
if you get skin hair and nails don't

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.420 
if you get skin hair and nails don't
just<00:02:50.140> grab<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.470> by<00:02:50.650> itself<00:02:50.920> because<00:02:51.250> that's

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
just grab that by itself because that's

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.560 
just grab that by itself because that's
not<00:02:51.640> going<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.910> be<00:02:51.940> enough<00:02:52.180> that's<00:02:52.390> going<00:02:52.510> to

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
not going to be enough that's going to

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.880 
not going to be enough that's going to
be<00:02:52.630> an<00:02:52.690> amazing<00:02:52.990> thing<00:02:53.140> but<00:02:53.290> make<00:02:53.470> sure<00:02:53.500> you're

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
be an amazing thing but make sure you're

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.320 
be an amazing thing but make sure you're
eliminating<00:02:54.400> every<00:02:54.580> day<00:02:54.730> make<00:02:55.000> sure<00:02:55.180> that

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
eliminating every day make sure that

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.990 
eliminating every day make sure that
you've<00:02:55.450> got<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:56.230> detox<00:02:56.800> or<00:02:57.130> if<00:02:57.670> you've<00:02:57.790> taken

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
you've got you detox or if you've taken

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.640 
you've got you detox or if you've taken
the<00:02:58.240> detox<00:02:58.660> make<00:02:58.900> sure<00:02:59.050> you're<00:02:59.200> taking<00:02:59.470> some

the detox make sure you're taking some

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.740 
the detox make sure you're taking some
maintenance<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.370> tone<00:03:00.610> powder<00:03:00.970> you're<00:03:01.690> on

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
maintenance and tone powder you're on

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.880 
maintenance and tone powder you're on
the<00:03:01.840> detox<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.350> can<00:03:02.440> couple<00:03:02.770> with<00:03:02.800> a

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
the detox you can couple with a

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.500 
the detox you can couple with a
respiratory<00:03:03.340> mix<00:03:03.760> if<00:03:03.970> you're<00:03:04.120> weak<00:03:04.300> through

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
respiratory mix if you're weak through

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.020 
respiratory mix if you're weak through
the<00:03:04.540> lungs<00:03:04.870> or<00:03:05.200> get<00:03:05.410> mucus<00:03:05.860> with<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.640> kidneys

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
the lungs or get mucus with the kidneys

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.600 
the lungs or get mucus with the kidneys
take<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.110> build<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.740> strong<00:03:09.130> foundation

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
take this and build a strong foundation

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.520 
take this and build a strong foundation
so<00:03:10.240> you've<00:03:10.360> got<00:03:10.390> your<00:03:10.540> intestinal<00:03:11.080> detox

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
so you've got your intestinal detox

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.140 
so you've got your intestinal detox
maybe<00:03:11.800> you've<00:03:11.950> got<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.070> kid<00:03:12.280> newest<00:03:12.490> then<00:03:13.000> you

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
maybe you've got a kid newest then you

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.030 
maybe you've got a kid newest then you
take<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.360> skin<00:03:13.660> here<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:13.960> now<00:03:14.080> somewhere<00:03:14.620> now

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
take the skin here and now somewhere now

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.190 
take the skin here and now somewhere now
you're<00:03:15.220> clean<00:03:15.490> on<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.730> inside<00:03:15.780> you're<00:03:16.780> bright

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
you're clean on the inside you're bright

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200 
you're clean on the inside you're bright
and<00:03:17.470> they<00:03:17.740> put<00:03:18.010> all<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.340> mineral<00:03:18.820> silicon

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
and they put all this mineral silicon

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.820 
and they put all this mineral silicon
living<00:03:19.450> in<00:03:19.510> your<00:03:19.630> skin<00:03:19.870> that's<00:03:20.560> when<00:03:20.770> you

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
living in your skin that's when you

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.550 
living in your skin that's when you
begin<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.100> look<00:03:21.220> attractive
