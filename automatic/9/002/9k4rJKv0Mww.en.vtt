00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
tensley awkward for both parties as

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.850 
tensley awkward for both parties as
opposed<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.689> just<00:01:58.840> like<00:01:59.049> ignoring<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.740> and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
opposed to just like ignoring it and

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.289 
opposed to just like ignoring it and
trying<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.189> act<00:02:00.399> like<00:02:00.490> it's<00:02:00.700> not<00:02:00.880> because<00:02:01.180> it's

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
trying to act like it's not because it's

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.029 
trying to act like it's not because it's
like<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.539> giant<00:02:01.899> elephant<00:02:02.259> in<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.380> room<00:02:02.409> now

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
like the giant elephant in the room now

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.380 
like the giant elephant in the room now
granted<00:02:03.399> there<00:02:03.610> are<00:02:03.670> fake<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.180> till<00:02:04.299> you<00:02:04.329> make

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
granted there are fake it till you make

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.810 
granted there are fake it till you make
it<00:02:04.509> situations<00:02:05.259> in<00:02:05.409> life<00:02:05.439> but<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:06.399> don't<00:02:06.549> think

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
it situations in life but I don't think

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.219 
it situations in life but I don't think
this<00:02:06.969> is<00:02:07.030> one<00:02:07.329> of<00:02:07.450> them<00:02:07.600> I<00:02:07.719> think<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:08.019> would<00:02:08.050> be

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
this is one of them I think it would be

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.180 
this is one of them I think it would be
fine<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:09.459> walk<00:02:09.580> up<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:09.940> him<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.209> like<00:02:10.420> hi

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
fine to walk up to him and you like hi

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.720 
fine to walk up to him and you like hi
so<00:02:12.190> I'm<00:02:13.000> really<00:02:13.569> uncomfortable<00:02:14.489> saying<00:02:15.489> this

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
so I'm really uncomfortable saying this

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.210 
so I'm really uncomfortable saying this
to<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.239> or<00:02:16.450> asking<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.230> but<00:02:17.739> I<00:02:17.769> figured

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
to you or asking you this but I figured

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.190 
to you or asking you this but I figured
there's<00:02:18.819> nothing<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.300> lose<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.810> might<00:02:20.050> as<00:02:20.170> well

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
there's nothing to lose I might as well

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.800 
there's nothing to lose I might as well
an<00:02:20.440> ask<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.950> if<00:02:21.190> not<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.970> know<00:02:22.090> no<00:02:22.480> pressure

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
an ask and if not you know no pressure

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.920 
an ask and if not you know no pressure
it's<00:02:23.140> no<00:02:23.380> big<00:02:23.560> deal<00:02:23.739> but<00:02:24.459> I<00:02:24.519> wanted<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.330> see<00:02:25.599> if

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
it's no big deal but I wanted to see if

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.720 
it's no big deal but I wanted to see if
you<00:02:26.080> would<00:02:26.200> be<00:02:26.349> interested<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:27.129> going<00:02:27.400> to
