00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
good for gaming you know the level of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.149 
good for gaming you know the level of
graphics<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.670> how<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.540> got<00:01:21.900> hell<00:01:22.229> goes<00:01:22.470> it's

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.929 
graphics and how it's got hell goes it's
not<00:01:23.369> good<00:01:23.580> enough<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:25.020> let's<00:01:25.770> check<00:01:26.369> out<00:01:26.580> next

not good enough so let's check out next

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
not good enough so let's check out next
one<00:01:27.950> as<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.549> goes<00:01:29.970> fine<00:01:30.780> after<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> few

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
one as you see it goes fine after a few

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.910 
one as you see it goes fine after a few
seconds<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.270> FPS<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.960> still<00:01:34.350> low<00:01:36.920> so

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
seconds but the FPS is still low so

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.350 
seconds but the FPS is still low so
let's<00:01:38.700> check<00:01:39.060> out<00:01:39.270> other<00:01:39.740> devices<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.939> second

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
let's check out other devices the second

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.490 
let's check out other devices the second
is<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:44.750> second<00:01:45.750> device<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.409> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
is going to be second device is going to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.360 
is going to be second device is going to
be<00:01:46.590> ace<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:47.100> liquid<00:01:47.540> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
be ace for liquid you can see that

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.920 
be ace for liquid you can see that
screen<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.360> bit<00:01:51.840> different<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:57.450> see<00:01:57.720> that

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
screen is a bit different and see that

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.560 
screen is a bit different and see that
screens<00:01:58.290> been<00:01:58.560> different<00:01:59.120> it's<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.360> loops

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
screens been different it's the loops

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.640 
screens been different it's the loops
finger<00:02:01.020> even<00:02:01.380> its<00:02:01.560> same<00:02:02.100> 3.5<00:02:02.940> inches<00:02:03.650> bigger

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
finger even its same 3.5 inches bigger

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.790 
finger even its same 3.5 inches bigger
than<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.550> has<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:07.850> let's<00:02:08.960> go<00:02:09.960> thing<00:02:10.260> as

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
than it and it has so let's go thing as

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.860 
than it and it has so let's go thing as
you<00:02:11.040> see<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.490> loggy<00:02:11.940> too<00:02:13.970> but<00:02:14.970> only<00:02:15.570> for<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
you see it's loggy too but only for a

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.690 
you see it's loggy too but only for a
couple<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.170> seconds<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.650> know<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.280> much

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
couple of seconds you know and it's much

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.270 
couple of seconds you know and it's much
it<00:02:18.420> goes<00:02:18.810> much<00:02:19.290> better<00:02:19.620> than<00:02:20.010> its<00:02:20.580> own<00:02:21.090> innate

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
it goes much better than its own innate

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.970 
it goes much better than its own innate
even<00:02:23.280> at<00:02:23.490> half<00:02:23.820> or<00:02:24.680> three<00:02:25.680> times<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.960> slower

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
even at half or three times so slower

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.940 
even at half or three times so slower
GPU<00:02:28.980> then<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.820> has<00:02:30.030> now<00:02:30.810> three<00:02:31.260> times<00:02:31.650> so

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
GPU then and it has now three times so

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.480 
GPU then and it has now three times so
GPU<00:02:34.700> but<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:36.270> gaming<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.720> better<00:02:36.960> yeah<00:02:37.740> so

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
GPU but the gaming is better yeah so

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.460 
GPU but the gaming is better yeah so
let's<00:02:38.940> go<00:02:39.150> next<00:02:39.900> device<00:02:40.400> it's<00:02:41.400> going<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.730> be

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
let's go next device it's going to be

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.070 
let's go next device it's going to be
samsung<00:02:43.470> wave<00:02:43.710> so<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:44.970> new<00:02:45.450> bada<00:02:45.780> OS<00:02:47.930> as<00:02:48.930> you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
samsung wave so it's new bada OS as you

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.690 
samsung wave so it's new bada OS as you
see<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.590> need<00:02:49.830> good<00:02:50.670> food<00:02:50.850> but<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:52.200> half<00:02:52.800> very

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
see you need good food but a half very

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.220 
see you need good food but a half very
very<00:02:54.090> good<00:02:54.410> hardware<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:56.430> make<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:58.080> it's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
very good hardware to to make it so it's

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.450 
very good hardware to to make it so it's
not<00:02:58.380> surprising

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.430 

but<00:03:04.180> it's<00:03:04.480> lagging<00:03:05.140> too<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.800> know<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:09.240> let's

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
but it's lagging too you know so let's

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.530 
but it's lagging too you know so let's

works<00:04:14.310> much<00:04:15.310> better<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:15.790> should<00:04:15.820> sensitive

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
works much better you should sensitive

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.350 
works much better you should sensitive
should<00:04:16.840> try<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.290> by<00:04:17.500> yourself<00:04:17.530> because<00:04:18.360> this

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
should try it by yourself because this

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.230 
should try it by yourself because this
sensor<00:04:20.170> is<00:04:20.350> best<00:04:20.920> answer<00:04:21.370> your<00:04:21.760> ever<00:04:22.000> met<00:04:24.240> so

here's<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.840> question<00:04:25.870> which<00:04:26.380> one<00:04:26.740> is<00:04:26.920> better

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
here's a question which one is better

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.590 
here's a question which one is better
nor<00:04:28.000> can<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.270> or<00:04:28.690> acer<00:04:29.470> liquid<00:04:29.940> it's<00:04:30.940> very<00:04:31.180> very

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
nor can it or acer liquid it's very very

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.870 
nor can it or acer liquid it's very very
hard<00:04:31.900> choice<00:04:32.320> because<00:04:32.800> for<00:04:33.160> me<00:04:33.280> knocking<00:04:33.700> it

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
hard choice because for me knocking it

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.250 
hard choice because for me knocking it
is<00:04:34.090> much<00:04:34.870> more<00:04:35.740> useful<00:04:36.310> device<00:04:36.990> but<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.110> can

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
is much more useful device but you can

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.220 
is much more useful device but you can
see<00:04:38.470> that<00:04:40.500> let<00:04:41.500> it's<00:04:41.680> simple<00:04:42.130> logic<00:04:43.170> like<00:04:44.170> that

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
see that let it's simple logic like that

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.210 
see that let it's simple logic like that
you<00:04:45.100> can<00:04:45.280> play

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
you can play

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.640 
you can play
as<00:04:48.220> for<00:04:48.550> five<00:04:48.820> much<00:04:49.180> better<00:04:49.510> on<00:04:49.900> your<00:04:52.650> liquid

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
as for five much better on your liquid

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.600 
as for five much better on your liquid
than<00:04:54.190> on<00:04:54.400> your<00:04:54.639> innate<00:04:55.080> but<00:04:56.080> is<00:04:57.040> it<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.370> problem

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
than on your innate but is it a problem

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.680 
than on your innate but is it a problem
of<00:04:58.000> nokia<00:04:58.690> or<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:59.260> problem<00:04:59.710> of<00:05:00.000> gameloft<00:05:01.000> it's

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
interesting question why gameloft games

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.640 
interesting question why gameloft games
works<00:05:05.410> awful<00:05:06.070> on<00:05:06.250> nokia<00:05:06.850> i'm<00:05:07.470> talking<00:05:08.470> really

works awful on nokia i'm talking really
it's<00:05:09.040> about<00:05:09.160> 30<00:05:10.150> seconds<00:05:10.690> for<00:05:10.960> gameloft<00:05:11.740> games

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
it's about 30 seconds for gameloft games

to start to go on normal FPS and that's
not<00:05:20.050> okay<00:05:21.600> so<00:05:22.600> the<00:05:23.320> liquid<00:05:23.620> is<00:05:23.970> better<00:05:24.970> than

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
not okay so the liquid is better than

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.629 
not okay so the liquid is better than

early but its customers from where so it

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.150 
early but its customers from where so it

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
should work fine and in doubt so it has

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.100
