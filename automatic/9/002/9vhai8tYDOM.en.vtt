00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
chocolatey but I actually think that's a

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.059 
chocolatey but I actually think that's a
little<00:03:59.340> too<00:03:59.480> overbearingly<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.900> too<00:04:01.200> plainly

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
little too overbearingly and too plainly

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.600 
little too overbearingly and too plainly
sweet<00:04:02.519> so<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.540> opted<00:04:04.349> out<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.920> but<00:04:05.189> if<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.400> do

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
sweet so I opted out of it but if you do

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.280 
sweet so I opted out of it but if you do
want<00:04:05.849> to<00:04:05.939> do<00:04:06.150> that<00:04:06.299> just<00:04:06.540> dust<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.110> with<00:04:07.260> a

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
want to do that just dust it with a

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.170 
want to do that just dust it with a
little<00:04:07.590> bit<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:07.950> dry<00:04:08.159> mixture<00:04:08.489> before<00:04:09.030> you

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
little bit of the dry mixture before you

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.410 
little bit of the dry mixture before you
fold<00:04:09.329> it<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:09.629> so<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.439> it<00:04:10.890> suspends<00:04:11.670> in<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
fold it in so that it suspends in the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.970 
fold it in so that it suspends in the
batter<00:04:12.599> rather<00:04:12.959> than<00:04:13.260> sink<00:04:13.590> all<00:04:13.739> to<00:04:13.860> the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
batter rather than sink all to the

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.009 
batter rather than sink all to the
bottom<00:04:14.129> I'm<00:04:14.670> just<00:04:15.030> going<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.269> smear<00:04:15.599> it<00:04:15.659> on<00:04:15.870> the

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
bottom I'm just going to smear it on the

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.870 
bottom I'm just going to smear it on the
bottom<00:04:16.350> like<00:04:16.530> this<00:04:16.829> so<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.370> makes<00:04:17.549> an<00:04:17.699> even

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
bottom like this so it makes an even

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.870 
bottom like this so it makes an even
layer<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.600> sometimes<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.889> like<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.430> kind<00:04:20.760> of

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
layer and sometimes I like to kind of

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.300 
layer and sometimes I like to kind of
soak<00:04:21.329> up<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.810> top<00:04:22.049> with<00:04:22.289> some<00:04:22.470> Kahlua<00:04:22.979> which

delicious caramel sauce here I have my
cold<00:05:24.449> brownies<00:05:25.080> on<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.949> board<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:26.610> it's<00:05:26.760> just

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
cold brownies on a board so it's just

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.270 
cold brownies on a board so it's just
easier<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.419> work<00:05:27.630> with<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:28.199> my<00:05:28.530> caramel<00:05:29.039> sauce

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
easier to work with and my caramel sauce

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.570 
easier to work with and my caramel sauce
that's<00:05:29.669> thick<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:30.690> buttery<00:05:31.199> and<00:05:31.500> gooey<00:05:32.099> and

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
that's thick and buttery and gooey and

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.790 
that's thick and buttery and gooey and
I've<00:05:32.789> actually<00:05:32.970> done<00:05:33.360> this<00:05:33.599> with<00:05:34.050> almond<00:05:34.560> milk

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
I've actually done this with almond milk

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.980 
I've actually done this with almond milk
before<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:35.639> just<00:05:35.820> takes<00:05:36.180> longer<00:05:36.449> and<00:05:36.690> it<00:05:36.840> gets

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
before it just takes longer and it gets

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.320 
before it just takes longer and it gets
really<00:05:37.229> ferocious<00:05:37.979> and<00:05:38.159> bubbly<00:05:38.460> and<00:05:38.490> hot<00:05:38.760> so

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
really ferocious and bubbly and hot so

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.810 
really ferocious and bubbly and hot so
works<00:05:39.570> better<00:05:39.870> on<00:05:40.199> the<00:05:40.620> stovetop<00:05:41.039> actually

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
works better on the stovetop actually

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.879 
works better on the stovetop actually
you<00:05:42.000> just<00:05:42.270> have<00:05:42.419> to<00:05:42.570> cook<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.900> for<00:05:43.050> longer<00:05:43.289> but

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
you just have to cook it for longer but

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.560 
you just have to cook it for longer but
the<00:05:44.039> rule<00:05:44.250> of<00:05:44.370> thumb<00:05:44.550> here<00:05:44.849> is<00:05:45.030> that<00:05:45.180> you<00:05:45.330> just

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
the rule of thumb here is that you just

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.040 
the rule of thumb here is that you just
want<00:05:45.810> to<00:05:46.289> condense<00:05:46.680> it<00:05:46.949> by<00:05:47.099> half<00:05:47.370> so<00:05:48.270> I<00:05:48.570> have

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
want to condense it by half so I have

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.680 
want to condense it by half so I have
some<00:05:49.349> pretzels<00:05:49.830> which<00:05:50.070> will<00:05:50.310> kind<00:05:50.880> of<00:05:51.060> in<00:05:51.300> part

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
some pretzels which will kind of in part

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.629 
some pretzels which will kind of in part
a<00:05:51.930> nice

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
a nice

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.659 
a nice
crunchiness<00:05:53.240> and<00:05:53.689> a<00:05:53.990> salty<00:05:54.560> bite<00:05:54.800> paired<00:05:55.550> with

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
crunchiness and a salty bite paired with

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.640 
crunchiness and a salty bite paired with
that<00:05:55.849> salted<00:05:56.419> caramel<00:05:56.810> it's<00:05:56.990> out<00:05:57.169> of<00:05:57.229> this

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
that salted caramel it's out of this

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.649 
that salted caramel it's out of this
world<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:58.580> you<00:05:58.669> can<00:05:58.699> really<00:05:58.969> layer<00:05:59.240> this<00:05:59.449> with

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659 
world so you can really layer this with

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.420 
world so you can really layer this with
whatever<00:05:59.810> candies<00:06:00.469> you<00:06:00.499> buy<00:06:00.830> I<00:06:00.860> can<00:06:01.129> just<00:06:01.310> have

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
whatever candies you buy I can just have

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.670 
whatever candies you buy I can just have
fun<00:06:01.639> with<00:06:01.699> it<00:06:02.060> so<00:06:02.539> just<00:06:02.719> scootch<00:06:03.169> them<00:06:03.379> on<00:06:03.499> in

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
fun with it so just scootch them on in

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.129 
fun with it so just scootch them on in
there<00:06:03.919> and<00:06:04.189> you<00:06:04.939> can<00:06:05.090> do<00:06:05.210> this<00:06:05.360> first<00:06:05.749> or<00:06:06.050> do

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
there and you can do this first or do

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:07.600 
there and you can do this first or do
you<00:06:06.199> can<00:06:06.349> do<00:06:06.439> this<00:06:06.590> after<00:06:06.770> you<00:06:07.189> blare<00:06:07.430> it<00:06:07.520> on

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
you can do this after you blare it on

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.010 
you can do this after you blare it on
the<00:06:07.729> caramel<00:06:08.060> sauce<00:06:08.270> really<00:06:08.569> doesn't<00:06:08.870> matter

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
the caramel sauce really doesn't matter

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.200 
the caramel sauce really doesn't matter
I<00:06:09.110> might<00:06:09.439> end<00:06:09.590> up<00:06:09.740> to<00:06:09.889> string<00:06:10.159> both<00:06:10.340> and<00:06:10.610> then

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
I might end up to string both and then

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.709 
I might end up to string both and then
just<00:06:11.419> lazily<00:06:12.050> just<00:06:12.439> drizzle<00:06:13.430> on<00:06:13.639> that<00:06:14.180> caramel

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:14.719 
just lazily just drizzle on that caramel

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:17.259 
just lazily just drizzle on that caramel
sauce<00:06:14.930> on<00:06:15.229> top
