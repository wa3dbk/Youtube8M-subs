00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
what about the brakes

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.150 
what about the brakes
well<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.990> brakes<00:03:32.260> have<00:03:32.410> been<00:03:32.440> upgraded<00:03:32.680> for

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
well the brakes have been upgraded for

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.940 
well the brakes have been upgraded for
this<00:03:33.310> year<00:03:33.520> but<00:03:33.730> still<00:03:34.320> last<00:03:35.320> year<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.830> he

this year but still last year that he

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.210 
this year but still last year that he
lost<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.340> brakes<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:36.940> as<00:03:37.270> a<00:03:37.870> result<00:03:38.350> spun<00:03:39.100> the
