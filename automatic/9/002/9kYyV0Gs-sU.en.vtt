00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
imagine that Amazing Grace didn't have

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.080 
imagine that Amazing Grace didn't have
lyrics<00:02:16.320> what<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.490> look<00:02:17.850> at<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
lyrics what we can do is look at the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.460 
lyrics what we can do is look at the
melody<00:02:18.720> so

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.560 

that's<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.550> phrase<00:02:23.760> that's<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:24.180> complete

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
that's a phrase that's a complete

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.920 
that's a phrase that's a complete
thought<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.200> melody<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.570> can<00:02:30.660> see

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
thought in the melody so as you can see

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.530 
thought in the melody so as you can see
each<00:02:31.200> phrase<00:02:31.650> are<00:02:31.920> separated<00:02:32.550> by<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.730> pause<00:02:33.120> or

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
each phrase are separated by a pause or

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.929 
each phrase are separated by a pause or
a<00:02:33.570> longer<00:02:34.110> note

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.789 

there's<00:02:38.939> another<00:02:39.209> phrase<00:02:42.439> so<00:02:43.439> that<00:02:43.590> was<00:02:43.709> our

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
there's another phrase so that was our

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.440 
there's another phrase so that was our
last<00:02:44.010> phrase<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:44.730> knew<00:02:44.879> that<00:02:44.909> because<00:02:45.239> it

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
last phrase and we knew that because it

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.390 
last phrase and we knew that because it
was<00:02:45.569> pause<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.430> just<00:02:47.430> before<00:02:47.579> it<00:02:49.099> so<00:02:50.099> we<00:02:50.250> know

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
was pause and just before it so we know

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.100 
was pause and just before it so we know
that<00:02:50.610> we<00:02:50.700> can<00:02:50.849> use<00:02:50.879> that<00:02:51.180> as<00:02:51.329> our<00:02:51.480> intro<00:02:51.900> which

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
that we can use that as our intro which

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.220 
that we can use that as our intro which
is<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.379> same<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.599> will<00:02:57.810> work<00:02:57.959> with<00:02:58.200> any

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
is the same and this will work with any

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.860 
is the same and this will work with any
song<00:02:58.680> any<00:02:58.980> any<00:02:59.370> chord<00:02:59.730> progression<00:03:00.209> any<00:03:00.450> type

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
song any any chord progression any type

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.530 
song any any chord progression any type
of<00:03:00.900> chun<00:03:01.349> use<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.280> as<00:03:02.459> your<00:03:02.489> intro<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.359> of

of chun use that as your intro and of
course<00:03:04.049> you<00:03:04.230> can<00:03:04.379> play<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.980> longer<00:03:05.879> intro

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.820 

so<00:03:19.580> I've<00:03:19.700> taken<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.150> gone<00:03:20.599> a<00:03:20.870> bit<00:03:20.900> further<00:03:21.470> back

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
so I've taken a gone a bit further back

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.110 
so I've taken a gone a bit further back
from<00:03:22.129> that<00:03:22.280> last<00:03:22.519> phrase<00:03:22.760> i've<00:03:22.970> actually

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
from that last phrase i've actually

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.750 
from that last phrase i've actually
played<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.599> last<00:03:24.200> two<00:03:24.410> phrases<00:03:24.890> but<00:03:25.280> that

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
played the last two phrases but that

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.259 
played the last two phrases but that
works<00:03:26.000> as<00:03:26.209> well<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.720> once<00:03:27.680> was<00:03:28.459> lost<00:03:28.489> but<00:03:29.090> now

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
works as well I once was lost but now

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.860 
works as well I once was lost but now
I'll<00:03:30.170> fill<00:03:30.849> was<00:03:31.849> blind<00:03:32.269> but<00:03:32.989> now<00:03:33.050> I<00:03:33.830> see<00:03:34.870> so

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
I'll fill was blind but now I see so

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.660 
I'll fill was blind but now I see so
that's<00:03:35.989> also<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.410> complete<00:03:36.799> thought<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.430> main

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
that's also a complete thought the main

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.400 
that's also a complete thought the main
thing<00:03:37.940> is<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.150> we're<00:03:38.420> finishing<00:03:38.750> on<00:03:39.170> that

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
thing is that we're finishing on that

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.100 
thing is that we're finishing on that
one<00:03:39.680> chord<00:03:40.099> at<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.489> end<00:03:40.730> which<00:03:41.390> brings<00:03:41.690> us<00:03:41.900> to

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
one chord at the end which brings us to

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.960 
one chord at the end which brings us to
the<00:03:42.319> one<00:03:42.530> chord<00:03:42.860> for<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.250> beginning<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.849> the

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
the one chord for the beginning of the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.199 
the one chord for the beginning of the
song<00:03:44.180> like<00:03:45.080> the<00:03:45.230> other<00:03:45.410> solution<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.760> use<00:03:47.000> a

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
song like the other solution is to use a

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.240 
song like the other solution is to use a
fail-proof<00:03:47.690> chord<00:03:48.470> progression<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:49.040> you

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
fail-proof chord progression that you

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.100 
fail-proof chord progression that you
can<00:03:49.430> put<00:03:49.700> at<00:03:49.879> the<00:03:49.940> beginning<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.510> any<00:03:50.810> song

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
can put at the beginning of any song

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.500 
can put at the beginning of any song
whatever<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.040> key<00:03:52.250> whether<00:03:52.760> it's<00:03:52.970> major<00:03:53.239> or

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
whatever the key whether it's major or

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.660 
whatever the key whether it's major or
minor<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:54.230> this<00:03:54.410> means<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:54.920> may<00:03:55.069> not<00:03:55.250> have

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
minor so this means you may not have

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.699 
minor so this means you may not have
even<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:56.360> might<00:03:56.540> be<00:03:56.690> sight<00:03:56.959> reading<00:03:57.200> it<00:03:57.500> might

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
even you might be sight reading it might

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.199 
even you might be sight reading it might
not<00:03:57.829> even<00:03:58.010> know<00:03:58.280> what<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.700> end<00:03:58.819> of<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.000> song

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
not even know what the end of the song

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.780 
not even know what the end of the song
sounds<00:03:59.630> like<00:03:59.780> or<00:03:59.959> what<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.470> phrases<00:04:00.920> are<00:04:01.160> so

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
sounds like or what the phrases are so

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.520 
sounds like or what the phrases are so
that<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.030> can<00:04:02.180> break<00:04:02.390> up<00:04:02.599> that<00:04:02.989> last<00:04:03.260> phrase

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
that you can break up that last phrase

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.920 
that you can break up that last phrase
to<00:04:03.890> use<00:04:03.920> as<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.280> intro<00:04:04.670> what<00:04:05.239> you<00:04:05.360> can<00:04:05.510> do<00:04:05.720> is

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
to use as the intro what you can do is

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.780 
to use as the intro what you can do is
take<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.620> simple<00:04:07.010> chord<00:04:07.220> progression<00:04:07.670> and

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
take the simple chord progression and

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.449 
take the simple chord progression and
use<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.209> in<00:04:08.299> any<00:04:08.540> situations<00:04:09.379> and<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:10.069> chord

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
use it in any situations and this chord

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.380 
use it in any situations and this chord
progression<00:04:10.940> is<00:04:11.170> two<00:04:12.170> minor<00:04:12.470> five<00:04:12.799> seven<00:04:13.400> one

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390

i'm using calling these chords by a
number<00:04:48.670> 25<00:04:49.670> and<00:04:49.910> one<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.390> so<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:50.960> you<00:04:51.080> can

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
number 25 and one and so that you can

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.200 
number 25 and one and so that you can
take<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.500> number<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:51.980> apply<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.520> any<00:04:52.790> key

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
take that number and apply it to any key

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.340 
take that number and apply it to any key
so<00:04:53.450> that<00:04:53.480> you<00:04:53.660> can<00:04:53.780> play<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:53.990> same

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
so that you can play the same

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.430 
so that you can play the same
progression<00:04:55.210> use<00:04:56.210> it<00:04:56.390> in<00:04:56.570> any<00:04:56.780> song<00:04:57.140> no<00:04:57.350> matter

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
progression use it in any song no matter

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.770 
progression use it in any song no matter

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
what carrot starts in okay and the

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.580 
what carrot starts in okay and the
number<00:05:00.230> is<00:05:00.260> referring<00:05:00.980> to<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.580> scale<00:05:01.940> tone

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
number is referring to the scale tone

number is referring to the scale tone
the<00:05:03.590> skeleton<00:05:04.040> is<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.900> number<00:05:06.110> of<00:05:06.410> the

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
the skeleton is the the number of the

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.250 
the skeleton is the the number of the
key<00:05:06.800> in<00:05:07.010> relation<00:05:07.610> to<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:08.090> scale<00:05:08.360> so<00:05:08.960> I'm

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
key in relation to the scale so I'm

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.620 
key in relation to the scale so I'm
playing<00:05:09.590> amazing<00:05:10.070> grace<00:05:10.100> in<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.520> key<00:05:10.670> of<00:05:10.700> F<00:05:11.710> so

playing amazing grace in the key of F so

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.410 
playing amazing grace in the key of F so
the<00:05:14.630> note<00:05:14.840> F<00:05:15.110> is<00:05:15.500> one<00:05:16.400> and<00:05:16.700> from<00:05:17.060> there<00:05:17.270> we

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
the note F is one and from there we

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.320 
the note F is one and from there we
count<00:05:17.660> up<00:05:17.780> one<00:05:18.050> two<00:05:18.530> three<00:05:19.070> four<00:05:19.550> five<00:05:19.610> six

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
mater has a b-flat in it so when I say

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.310

or 7th Corps that snap begins on that

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.030 
or 7th Corps that snap begins on that
note<00:05:39.110> which<00:05:39.620> is<00:05:40.810> 2-7<00:05:41.810> or<00:05:42.169> in<00:05:42.290> this<00:05:42.380> case<00:05:42.440> G

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
note which is 2-7 or in this case G

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.500 
note which is 2-7 or in this case G
minor<00:05:43.310> 7<00:05:43.760> or<00:05:44.480> just<00:05:44.840> do<00:05:45.050> minor<00:05:46.210> so<00:05:47.210> that's<00:05:47.419> how

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
minor 7 or just do minor so that's how

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.350 
minor 7 or just do minor so that's how
to<00:05:47.600> minor<00:05:48.080> then<00:05:48.680> we're<00:05:48.830> going<00:05:48.950> to<00:05:49.040> play<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:49.610> 57

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
to minor then we're going to play the 57

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.870 
to minor then we're going to play the 57
so<00:05:50.480> we<00:05:50.570> go<00:05:50.690> up<00:05:50.720> to<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:51.050> fifth<00:05:51.380> scale<00:05:51.919> tone<00:05:52.190> so

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
so we go up to the fifth scale tone so

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.230 
so we go up to the fifth scale tone so
one<00:05:53.090> two<00:05:53.390> three<00:05:54.050> four<00:05:54.560> five<00:05:54.970> then<00:05:55.970> we're<00:05:56.120> going

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
one two three four five then we're going

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.310 
one two three four five then we're going
to<00:05:56.300> play

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
to play

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.700 
to play
at<00:05:57.640> dominant<00:05:58.640> court<00:05:59.090> that's<00:05:59.480> what<00:05:59.720> 57<00:06:00.560> when

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
at dominant court that's what 57 when

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.170 
at dominant court that's what 57 when
there's<00:06:00.890> a<00:06:00.950> seven<00:06:01.340> right<00:06:01.550> beside<00:06:01.850> the<00:06:01.940> court

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
there's a seven right beside the court

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.460 
there's a seven right beside the court
it<00:06:02.300> means<00:06:02.450> that<00:06:02.600> the<00:06:02.690> dominant<00:06:03.110> chord<00:06:03.320> and

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
it means that the dominant chord and

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.910 
it means that the dominant chord and
this<00:06:03.920> means<00:06:04.160> we're<00:06:04.310> playing<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.640> major<00:06:04.850> triad

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
this means we're playing a major triad

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.980 
this means we're playing a major triad
with<00:06:07.000> that<00:06:08.000> I'll<00:06:08.120> play<00:06:08.270> that<00:06:08.450> with<00:06:08.570> one<00:06:08.720> hand

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
with that I'll play that with one hand

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
with that I'll play that with one hand
major<00:06:09.710> triad<00:06:10.300> with<00:06:11.300> the<00:06:11.660> minor<00:06:12.050> 7th<00:06:12.590> on<00:06:12.770> top

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
major triad with the minor 7th on top

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.370 
major triad with the minor 7th on top
that's<00:06:13.310> our<00:06:13.460> dominant<00:06:13.970> ok<00:06:14.630> let's<00:06:14.900> built<00:06:15.200> on

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
that's our dominant ok let's built on

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.370 
that's our dominant ok let's built on
the<00:06:15.530> first<00:06:15.860> note<00:06:16.190> of<00:06:16.700> the<00:06:17.480> scale<00:06:17.600> so<00:06:18.260> that's

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
the first note of the scale so that's

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.240 
the first note of the scale so that's
how<00:06:18.470> 57<00:06:19.100> so<00:06:19.250> we've<00:06:19.370> gone<00:06:19.520> two<00:06:19.820> minor<00:06:20.060> five

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
how 57 so we've gone two minor five

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:28.060 
how 57 so we've gone two minor five
seven<00:06:22.250> and<00:06:23.000> then<00:06:23.990> we<00:06:24.110> go<00:06:24.260> to<00:06:24.290> one

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.520 

so<00:06:28.820> that's<00:06:29.030> that<00:06:29.360> that's<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.960> progression

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
so that's that that's the progression

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.980 
so that's that that's the progression
what<00:06:31.100> we<00:06:31.220> can<00:06:31.370> do<00:06:31.550> now<00:06:31.790> is<00:06:31.820> add<00:06:32.210> this<00:06:32.420> we<00:06:32.810> can

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
what we can do now is add this we can

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.400 
what we can do now is add this we can
add<00:06:33.170> the<00:06:33.350> seventh<00:06:33.740> to<00:06:34.010> our<00:06:34.160> two<00:06:34.370> minor<00:06:35.410> which

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
add the seventh to our two minor which

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.860 
add the seventh to our two minor which
is<00:06:36.560> that<00:06:36.740> if<00:06:37.010> there

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.390 

you<00:06:42.870> can<00:06:43.050> either<00:06:43.290> stick<00:06:43.620> around<00:06:43.830> on<00:06:44.070> it<00:06:44.250> if

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
you can either stick around on it if

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.689 
you can either stick around on it if
major<00:06:44.669> chord<00:06:45.030> and<00:06:45.650> to<00:06:46.650> come<00:06:46.860> in<00:06:46.979> with<00:06:47.130> amazing

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 
major chord and to come in with amazing

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.370 
major chord and to come in with amazing
grace<00:06:47.880> or<00:06:48.120> you<00:06:48.750> can<00:06:48.960> go<00:06:49.710> to<00:06:49.740> your<00:06:50.070> sass<00:06:50.340> for

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.680 

and<00:06:53.650> it<00:06:54.400> kind<00:06:54.640> of<00:06:54.700> draws<00:06:55.000> it<00:06:55.210> out<00:06:55.300> even<00:06:55.630> a

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
and it kind of draws it out even a

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.440 
and it kind of draws it out even a
little<00:06:55.840> bit<00:06:55.960> more<00:06:56.910> so<00:06:57.910> we<00:06:57.970> put<00:06:58.210> up<00:06:58.360> g<00:06:59.200> minus<00:06:59.410> 7

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
little bit more so we put up g minus 7

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.679 
little bit more so we put up g minus 7
a-5<00:07:01.450> sooner<00:07:01.840> and<00:07:02.350> back<00:07:02.680> to<00:07:02.830> our<00:07:02.950> one
