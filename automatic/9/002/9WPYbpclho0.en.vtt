00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
paralyzing it burning it poisoning it

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750 
paralyzing it burning it poisoning it
always<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> good<00:01:11.070> coal<00:01:11.250> putting<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.729> sleep

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
always a good coal putting it to sleep

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.380 
always a good coal putting it to sleep
also<00:01:12.450> very<00:01:12.630> good<00:01:12.840> um<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.460> yeah<00:01:14.580> Magneton<00:01:15.119> got<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
also very good um so yeah Magneton got a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.289 
also very good um so yeah Magneton got a
paralyze<00:01:15.840> which<00:01:16.020> helps<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.439> pretty<00:01:16.650> well<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
paralyze which helps out pretty well and

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.580 
paralyze which helps out pretty well and
let<00:01:18.299> me<00:01:18.420> see<00:01:18.630> how<00:01:18.750> much<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.930> Thunder<00:01:19.380> shock

good<00:01:23.130> stats<00:01:23.430> all<00:01:23.580> around<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.060> I'm<00:01:24.150> not<00:01:24.240> even

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
good stats all around so I'm not even

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.210 
good stats all around so I'm not even
sure<00:01:24.570> how<00:01:24.689> much<00:01:24.840> I'll<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.979> thing

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
sure how much I'll do and that thing

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.859 
sure how much I'll do and that thing
actually<00:01:26.610> took<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.939> like<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> beast

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
actually took it like a beast

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.630 
actually took it like a beast
so<00:01:28.140> I'm<00:01:28.740> actually<00:01:28.920> probably<00:01:29.159> gonna<00:01:29.460> switch

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
so I'm actually probably gonna switch

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
especially if this thing is using that

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.789 
especially if this thing is using that
move<00:01:33.570> its<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> keep<00:01:34.140> restoring<00:01:34.680> health

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
move its going to keep restoring health

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.230

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
plus they can learn cosmic power which

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.700 
plus they can learn cosmic power which
boosts<00:04:39.510> up<00:04:39.660> its<00:04:39.840> defense<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.410> special

definitely the most epic Pokemon makeup
even<00:05:57.990> though<00:05:58.139> it's<00:05:58.289> not<00:05:58.409> going<00:05:58.620> on<00:05:58.710> my<00:05:58.800> team

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
even though it's not going on my team

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.589 
even though it's not going on my team
it's<00:05:59.190> still<00:05:59.400> an<00:05:59.460> awesome<00:05:59.580> bug<00:06:00.000> and<00:06:00.150> fire<00:06:00.300> type

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
it's still an awesome bug and fire type

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.450 
it's still an awesome bug and fire type
umm<00:06:01.139> but<00:06:01.409> yeah<00:06:01.470> as<00:06:01.650> you<00:06:01.830> can<00:06:01.889> see<00:06:02.010> it<00:06:02.310> has<00:06:02.430> a

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
umm but yeah as you can see it has a

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.339 
umm but yeah as you can see it has a
terrible<00:06:03.120> move<00:06:03.300> set<00:06:03.570> when<00:06:03.690> you<00:06:03.750> first<00:06:03.960> get<00:06:04.169> it

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
terrible move set when you first get it

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.290 
terrible move set when you first get it
but<00:06:04.650> that's<00:06:04.949> a<00:06:05.250> lot<00:06:05.490> of<00:06:05.520> great<00:06:05.760> moves<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.150> learn

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
but that's a lot of great moves to learn

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.180 
but that's a lot of great moves to learn
in<00:06:06.449> the<00:06:06.539> long<00:06:06.720> run<00:06:06.960> so<00:06:07.039> definitely<00:06:08.039> don't

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
in the long run so definitely don't

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.589 
in the long run so definitely don't
think<00:06:08.370> it's<00:06:08.460> a<00:06:08.520> terrible<00:06:08.880> Pokemon<00:06:09.330> because<00:06:09.539> I

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
think it's a terrible Pokemon because I

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.510 
think it's a terrible Pokemon because I
mean<00:06:09.750> look<00:06:09.990> at<00:06:10.050> its<00:06:10.199> special<00:06:10.530> attack<00:06:10.800> 110

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
mean look at its special attack 110

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.250 
mean look at its special attack 110
already<00:06:11.880> that's<00:06:12.300> absolutely<00:06:12.779> insane

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
already that's absolutely insane

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.550 
already that's absolutely insane
so<00:06:13.620> yeah<00:06:14.159> Volcarona<00:06:14.580> is<00:06:14.909> definitely<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.330> gray

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
so yeah Volcarona is definitely a gray
