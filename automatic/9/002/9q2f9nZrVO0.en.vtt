00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
forward ever so slightly ok just like

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.219 
forward ever so slightly ok just like
that<00:01:23.360> so<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:24.479> when<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.840> slide<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.200> forward

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
guess that wouldn't be a very impressive

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.030 
guess that wouldn't be a very impressive
color<00:01:28.890> change<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.200> isn't<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> deck<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.829> just
