00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.300 
to they'll do more precise measurements
and<00:01:29.909> more<00:01:30.029> closely<00:01:30.479> fit<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.229> door<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and more closely fit that door to the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.679 
and more closely fit that door to the
space<00:01:32.549> yeah<00:01:32.969> the<00:01:33.119> other<00:01:33.240> thing<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.539> have<00:01:33.569> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
space yeah the other thing you have to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.179 
space yeah the other thing you have to
consider<00:01:33.899> is<00:01:34.349> that<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.590> you're<00:01:34.740> building<00:01:34.919> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
consider is that if you're building a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.919 
consider is that if you're building a
bench<00:01:35.429> into<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:35.999> steam<00:01:36.240> shower<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.659> can't

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
bench into the steam shower you can't

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.260 
bench into the steam shower you can't
use<00:01:37.139> any<00:01:37.380> wood<00:01:37.649> product<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.279> not<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.579> no<00:01:38.700> 2x4

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
use any wood product and not so no 2x4

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.269 
use any wood product and not so no 2x4
is<00:01:39.359> you<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.599> only<00:01:39.719> use<00:01:39.959> concrete<00:01:40.740> block<00:01:41.009> or

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:41.279 
is you can only use concrete block or

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:42.919 
is you can only use concrete block or
styrofoam<00:01:41.939> because<00:01:42.389> you<00:01:42.630> don't<00:01:42.779> want

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
styrofoam because you don't want

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.120 
styrofoam because you don't want
anything<00:01:43.139> that<00:01:43.319> it's<00:01:43.529> going<00:01:43.679> to<00:01:43.739> absorb<00:01:43.919> any

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
anything that it's going to absorb any

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.679 
anything that it's going to absorb any
moisture<00:01:44.340> over<00:01:44.729> time<00:01:44.939> that's<00:01:45.299> right<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.599> then

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
moisture over time that's right and then

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.419 
moisture over time that's right and then
finally<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.469> have<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.829> make<00:01:46.979> sure<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> you

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
finally you have to make sure that you

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.819 
finally you have to make sure that you
have<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.609> glass<00:01:48.119> transom<00:01:48.719> fitted<00:01:49.409> above<00:01:49.679> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
have a glass transom fitted above the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.129 
have a glass transom fitted above the
door<00:01:50.099> so<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.729> again<00:01:51.119> stop<00:01:51.569> steam<00:01:51.899> from

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
door so that again stop steam from

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:53.599 
door so that again stop steam from
coming<00:01:52.469> out<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.009> need<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.279> make<00:01:53.429> sure

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
coming out and you need to make sure

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.940 
coming out and you need to make sure
that<00:01:53.789> your<00:01:53.939> ceiling<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.450> tiled<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.169> that<00:01:55.829> it

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that your ceiling is tiled and that it

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.739 
that your ceiling is tiled and that it
has<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.459> slight<00:01:56.759> slope<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.359> the<00:01:57.539> water

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:57.749 
has a slight slope so that the water

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.899 
has a slight slope so that the water
flows<00:01:58.439> off<00:01:58.679> to<00:01:58.889> one<00:01:59.130> side<00:01:59.159> or<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.609> other<00:01:59.700> and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
flows off to one side or the other and

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.399 
flows off to one side or the other and
then<00:02:00.119> goes<00:02:00.359> down<00:02:00.389> the<00:02:00.689> wall<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.139> there<00:02:01.289> you

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
then goes down the wall so there you

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.749 
then goes down the wall so there you
have<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.590> steam<00:02:01.889> showers<00:02:02.249> are<00:02:02.399> great<00:02:02.579> things

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
have it steam showers are great things

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.979 
have it steam showers are great things
to<00:02:02.909> include<00:02:03.239> in<00:02:03.329> your<00:02:03.359> home<00:02:03.569> but<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.779> have<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
to include in your home but you have to

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.389 
to include in your home but you have to

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
make sure you construct them properly

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:14.250 
make sure you construct them properly
see<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.849> next<00:02:06.029> time
