00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.309
 all massive sdram 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.990
 I wish I could be in parallel 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.910
 universe where instead of doing 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.070
 some shit on the internet i'm 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.410
 multimillionaire tycoon possessing 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.600
 perpetual license to kill fat 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.160
 women who wear miniskirts but since 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.660
 theories of moving to other spaces 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.130
 i don't have that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.439
 settle for cartoon league 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.149
 justice crisis of two worlds in 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.280
 At the beginning we see how Lex Luther 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.079
 escapes from prison in a world where there is 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.809
 alternative evil justice league 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.640
 called spotted syndicate and 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.620
 apparently in a parallel universe delicious 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.809
 impressive title works somewhere 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.000
 on the contrary luther not wanting to endure this 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.559
 mayhem migrates to a parallel world 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.480
 and then we all wonder what the workers are 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.520
 the places are busy with visitors so 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.199
 way we get into the world with the classic 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.449
 justice league where batman 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.100
 breaks my heart I'm accustomed to 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.500
 the fact that this is a noble dark knight 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.870
 who guards the hearth of justice in 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 this unfair world and never 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.799
 go to an amoral act but here he is 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.430
 I do n't even know if you are ready for such 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.979
 discoveries 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.439
 okay you too it's time to grow up and 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.229
 forget about the icons of childhood in one of the scenes 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.350
 batman takes renting away from flash drives 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.080
 and eats it the same thing if 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.270
 batman took the candy from the baby but shit 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.600
 I'm on some hypothetical baby 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.340
 and this flash will continue the story by doing 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.560
 pretend to move away from this blow 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.360
 parallel luther meets league and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.490
 talks about his world where he was 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.560
 the superhero who lost to the team 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.479
 villains and what surprised me so this 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.790
 that superman instantly confirms 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.740
 that this is not their luther but the martian reads 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.470
 his thoughts in order to confirm his innocence and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.360
 all this is very logical but somehow fresh 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.220
 it would be much more interesting if 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.930
 early Lex stumbled upon those heroes 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.970
 who could not mind their 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.219
 ability to recognize the fact that he 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.540
 from another world and would put him in 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.430
 a prison and only ten years from now 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.159
 realized it would be 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.409
 life-affirming story as well as conflict 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.540
 missed though what is already here in the appendage 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.970
 so this conflicts and so league 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.370
 moves with Lex to his world and here 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.180
 the idea should start the main story 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.689
 but everyone just starts drinking 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.640
 faces long stretched endlessly 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.010
 I understand that this strange claim to 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.269
 comic book but it's too much 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.549
 a lot of action 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.590
 70 percent cartoon everything is just a friend 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.599
 a friend for a man who 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.670
 for the first time will face the world of dc in this 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.340
 cartoon all this will look like 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.650
 weekdays badger fetishists dynamic 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.349
 action is good but never fight 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.909
 cardboard figures yes there is a line of love 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.040
 martian and daughter of the president 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.709
 parallel world as a discharge 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.840
 but it does nâ€™t move the essence 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.060
 it's almost not here until it comes to 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.609
 to the climax where is the local batman 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.900
 man owl hello keeper trying 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.730
 realize your really 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.040
 immoral but scary 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.810
 logical plan at least for the sake of it 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.849
 character cartoon is to evaluate 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.290
 but she did not stand next to not with superman not 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.840
 especially with the return of the dark 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.000
 knight just not annoying little thing 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.189
 who had the opportunity to represent 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.200
 something more interesting oh yes 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.450
 prepare for problems regarding 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.310
 find russian version on license cartoon 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.599
 we did not go out and the network has only 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.310
 amateur voiceovers 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.319
 but as an alternative on trackers 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.190
 hanging version with just terrifying 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.169
 subtitled 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.419
 the author who is clearly dreaming of making yourself 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.310
 a career in a crooked mirror besides 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:29.470
 many English words are translated as 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.239
 same english words only russian 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.549
 letters but it's not so bad 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.989
 how about to call luther in 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.290
 Kutsenko subtitles you understand to the end 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.329
 Kutsenko 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.829
 humor as art never before 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.229
 reached such a climax 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.389
 since I have touched on such a slippery topic 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:48.040
 write in the comments see what 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.989
 movie or cartoon you had 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.509
 face the most upset translation 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.609
 what did you hear well was the actor with you 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:58.620
 all the best and thanks for the fish 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.620
 broadcast specifically for gameplay.
