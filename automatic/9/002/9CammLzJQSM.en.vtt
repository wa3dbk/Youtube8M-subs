go ahead and move on to this mess of a
hair<00:03:46.859> I<00:03:47.099> did<00:03:47.549> not<00:03:47.760> feel<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.030> doing<00:03:48.180> anything

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
hair I did not feel like doing anything

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.970 
hair I did not feel like doing anything
and<00:03:48.689> I<00:03:48.750> feel<00:03:48.930> like<00:03:49.079> I<00:03:49.230> was<00:03:49.439> going<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.799> beach

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
and I feel like I was going to a beach

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.410 
and I feel like I was going to a beach
so<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.489> did<00:03:50.639> not<00:03:50.790> want<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.030> spend<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.329> much

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
so I did not want to spend that much

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.449 
so I did not want to spend that much
time<00:03:51.810> doing<00:03:51.989> my<00:03:52.109> hair<00:03:52.349> and<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:52.920> was<00:03:53.010> kind<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.340> a

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
time doing my hair and it was kind of a

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.430 
time doing my hair and it was kind of a
little<00:03:53.790> humid<00:03:54.359> up<00:03:54.450> so<00:03:54.659> I<00:03:54.689> figured<00:03:55.079> I<00:03:55.290> would

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
little humid up so I figured I would

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.409 
little humid up so I figured I would
just<00:03:55.470> throw<00:03:55.949> my<00:03:56.099> hair<00:03:56.310> up<00:03:56.340> in<00:03:56.579> a<00:03:57.000> nice<00:03:57.209> little

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
just throw my hair up in a nice little

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.349 
just throw my hair up in a nice little
side<00:03:57.750> view<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.590> just<00:03:59.040> basically<00:03:59.220> took<00:04:00.150> two

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
side view so I just basically took two

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.970 
side view so I just basically took two
pieces<00:04:00.569> I<00:04:00.840> have<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.049> full<00:04:01.290> tutorial<00:04:01.440> on<00:04:01.829> how<00:04:01.949> to

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
pieces I have a full tutorial on how to

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.640 
pieces I have a full tutorial on how to
do<00:04:02.280> this<00:04:02.459> exact<00:04:03.120> twisty<00:04:04.109> braid<00:04:04.319> thing<00:04:04.530> I'll

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
do this exact twisty braid thing I'll

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.379 
do this exact twisty braid thing I'll
link<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:04.949> down<00:04:05.040> below<00:04:05.099> but<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.849> basically<00:04:06.239> just

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
link it down below but I basically just

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.599 
link it down below but I basically just
kind<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.840> put<00:04:07.109> this<00:04:07.230> little<00:04:07.560> side<00:04:07.859> twisted

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.309 
braided detail asks thing it's really
easy<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.609> do<00:04:11.909> it<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.090> lot<00:04:12.269> so<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:12.750> just<00:04:12.989> did<00:04:13.139> this<00:04:13.260> to

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
easy I do it a lot so I just did this to

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.680 
easy I do it a lot so I just did this to
my<00:04:13.560> one<00:04:13.769> side<00:04:13.980> of<00:04:14.099> my<00:04:14.159> hair<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:15.120> most<00:04:15.449> of<00:04:15.599> my

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
my one side of my hair that most of my

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.050 
my one side of my hair that most of my
side<00:04:15.989> most<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:16.949> hair<00:04:17.099> was<00:04:17.250> parted<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.820> I

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
side most of the hair was parted to I

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.689 
side most of the hair was parted to I
had<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> little<00:04:18.989> tangles<00:04:19.590> going<00:04:19.919> on<00:04:20.039> but<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.519> just

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
had a little tangles going on but I just

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.490 
had a little tangles going on but I just
kind<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:20.909> loosely<00:04:21.269> did<00:04:21.599> that<00:04:21.810> not<00:04:22.109> too<00:04:22.349> much

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
kind of loosely did that not too much

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.050 
kind of loosely did that not too much
and<00:04:22.710> then<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:22.860> loosen<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.400> up<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.699> make<00:04:23.820> it<00:04:23.940> look

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
and then I loosen it up and make it look

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.170 
and then I loosen it up and make it look
really<00:04:24.330> casual<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:26.340> once<00:04:26.520> that's<00:04:26.669> done<00:04:26.940> I

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
really casual so once that's done I

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.820 
really casual so once that's done I
don't<00:04:27.240> pin<00:04:27.599> it<00:04:27.690> or<00:04:27.810> anything<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.289> just<00:04:28.320> kind<00:04:28.710> of
