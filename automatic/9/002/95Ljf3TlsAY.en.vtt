00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.509
 come out so expensive because just the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.880
 new games are usually not 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.770

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.970
 Mexicans because 800 pesos I do not really know 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.939
 they come out very expensive but not because 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.350

 education I bring you blessing 1 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.010
 command called mutan zombie by vanina 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.540
 minecraft good the point is that many 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.460
 we will know the mod of this of the 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.140
 mutant zombies that you add then they are not 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.660
 my very strong that humiliate us and that 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.369
 deformed saints and obviously so 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.290
 they finish already later the versions like 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.990
 comes being not the one in plaintiff and 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.060

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.070
 Commandos creator of keys called magma 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.110
 sting has created or recreated the mod in 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.610
 commands then the best of everything is 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.080
 which is a map that you have to download 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.970
 they put us there to them lowers in the description 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.410
 mapita and also the magma channel 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.850
 kisting to be passed and want to see 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.680

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.330
 they will appear here in front of 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.039
 this one like the whole zombie and so 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.450
 you are going there we can appear the map 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.580
 I remember that you can only put in a 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.289
 server or I do not know and put that stack with 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.659
 his friends and it's pretty funny 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.579
 signals 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.259
 well here we will see what we have 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.090
 we have enough little things that are going to 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.590
 hold 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.600
 they will help us to endure against the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.149
 zombie lord then we know that put together 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.190
 how we should arm ourselves and good for 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.860
 appear we will need 20 of 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.530
 rotten meat then let's count 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.489
 with 234 we already have 20 of rotten meat 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.379
 we have to need a zombie head 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.530
 we will also need to invoke it 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:29.500
 5 balls of slim good pellets good if 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.269
 they are not balls and one need our 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.489
 senator reporting internet are for 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.030
 that does not kill me then we're going to 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.849
 appear right now the good ones are very 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.280
 little 1 2 3 4 5 123 good and we have to 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.629
 throw 20 pipes and all 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.810
 together but I'm fine 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:49.299
 then it does not say it out there appeared the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.640
 sir are my mutant so i'm going to 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.079
 be careful, the good thing is that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.910
 the zombies are burning crap not 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:58.209
 part way in the esplanade has three 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.650
 skills this are crazy bill this the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.080
 first skill because as they already happened 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.960
 disappear minions zombies account 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.250
 from him who help him fight his case 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.010
 skill as well as they will have 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.650
 account was when he threw us into the air we 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.300
 let anger although really crazy mind 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.830
 it did not re-launch this park 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:25.650
 these golden apples do not work 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:27.180
 this is my third skill because it is a 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.250
 great match as you can see he hit the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.950
 soil and it does us quite harm then 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.350
 good to look has fallen from the first time 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.550
 this is a bill of three lives as 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.170
 you can see right now that that trick like 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.090
 that tripped I do not walk or stumbled 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.820
 we got quite hurt and it's like your 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.350
 first phase falls and good already after 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.940
 that he falls the third time is already going 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.910
 to die then we have to be 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.710
 hitting a lot a lot a lot a lot 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.030
 fight against the zombies and well what 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.040
 to run 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.959
 and try to kill us I'm holding on 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.610
 him for the golden apples 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.709
 obviously look that the 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.450
 second time evidently if you do not have 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.190
 team part fac and the zombies we 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.380
 burn because they are at stake to race 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.090
 for we are going to mark ceiling I am already 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.860
 I studied your site that worked the most 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.440
 enough life I have to eat eat 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.660

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.190
 pastures you hear them but 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.169
 always in any of the minecraft 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.049
 you want to flatten it you want to build and 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.820

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.620
 let you walk at ease but let's 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.870
 kill the zombie lord she fell for 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.190
 third time then that means 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.960
 that will not be left any more 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.240

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.740
 the zombies that want 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.740
 of these without any problem 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.190
 it's a moment me mm what is being 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.889
 my little glass of water before recording 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:39.150
 then that is affecting me in the 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.430
 performance of my vocal cords 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.750
 this has been what saying then the 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.120
 today's video we will see if 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.650
 we can have many likes much more 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.380
 for them to bring more things and 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.570
 mutant things and weird things and if in the 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.300
 then good channel is appreciated enough 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.830
 and well, here we can appear 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.470
 many more zombies because we have 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.150
 a lot of material then 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.030
 no inconvenience that would happen 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.260
 wind and everything I have this happens 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.060

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.640
 experiment 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.790
 it does not appear they have to be the quantities 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.070
 exact because I imagine that if you 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.350

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.360
