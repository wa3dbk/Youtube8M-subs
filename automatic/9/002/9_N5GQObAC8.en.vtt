00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.750
 today we are going to tell the scanner who does not 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.280
 Imagine formula p 215 scanners like 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.500
 you can observe extremely 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.470
 notebook weighing just under a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.570
 is extremely easy there is no 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.119
 need to carry a source of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.560
 feed directly from the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.680
 USB port 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.929
 as you can perceive is is what we 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.350
 we are showing the opening of these cane 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.700
 where I have all the resources 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.210
 required to do the scanning 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.379
 of the document in a4 format even 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.050
 larger 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.930
 here we see the button 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.270
 the power button 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.160
 scanner in case you get the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.230
 today while all the components where 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.079
 I have the element scanning 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.020
 lower scan element upper 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.719
 the power roller and asks you to 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.260
 separation for multiple feed 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.360
 leaves as you can see the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.110
 extremely simple power be 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.450
 changed 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.670
 the only part of the scandal that is 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.159
 irreplaceable or together with the application for 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.590
 separation that is also super simple 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.299
 make the exchange of them there are sold 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.790
 separately 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.290
 already in case of wear and is the only 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.290
 element that wears 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.020
 then this is basically the scanner are 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.500
 the letters there showing closure and 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.720
 You have all the ease of taking 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.909
 to anywhere 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.850
 here we have a sample scanning 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.360
 of a contract where I placed it matters 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.250
 the order that he is simply 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.950
 I hit the boot button it is 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.290
 three-sheet scanning and 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.600
 As you can propose, you can realize that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.060
 at the end of this scan 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.549
 we will have six images ie it does 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.040
 the front and back scan 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.799
 at the same time this scanner has the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.960
 capacity up to 20 sheets make the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.799
 scanning in case of files 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.289
 larger 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.260
 you can put more sheets continues to 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.510
 scanning 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.700
 here we are demonstrating the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.659
 ease of card scanning 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.860
 then visit as you can realize 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.810
 simply clinical and for your 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.620
 set of business cards that you 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.879
 and it helps you manage your 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.849
 your contacts 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.239
 there is even why it comes a software 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:37.480
 scan called biscardi this is a 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.220
 Another example of a hard card that 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.299
 We could be putting the 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.819
 The medical insurance card is a 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.290
 ok badge also make this 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.420
 scanning biscardi from it goes here 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.400
 is configured to do the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.530
 automatic recognition of my card 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.930
 business and this business card is like 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.450
 you can understand 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.849
 automatically it is already indexing all 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.639
 the fields of that is identify 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.599
 the name of the contact automatically 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:16.989
 the address the sepe the phone 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.090
 the email address here in this case he 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.849
 just did not put the web address that is 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:26.349
 on the card but I can quietly 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:28.690
 do the manual editing of who the other 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.209
 detail is extremely important is that 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.400
 the amount of formats I can 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.139
 export this caconde visits 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.440
 so I can integrate with it 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.540
 such as the ricard format 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.819
 This makes it easier to synchronize my 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.790
 from my email account from my account 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.790
 in iCloud or any service I 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.829
 I have in the cloud of contacts or even 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.669
 on my own desktop do the management 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.669
 of this contact
