captured Garfield doing various things
while<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.160> sit<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> couch<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:14.630> I've<00:00:15.630> never

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
while I sit on a couch and I've never

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.750 
while I sit on a couch and I've never
actually<00:00:16.170> caught<00:00:16.650> him<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:16.980> act<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.430> coming

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
actually caught him in the act of coming

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.630 
actually caught him in the act of coming
to<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.210> couch<00:00:18.420> right<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.439> his<00:00:19.830> own<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.609> I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
to the couch right on his own so I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.490 
to the couch right on his own so I
thought<00:00:21.029> I'd<00:00:21.150> try<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.390> little<00:00:21.600> experiment<00:00:22.050> here

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
thought I'd try a little experiment here

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500 
thought I'd try a little experiment here
and<00:00:22.619> actually<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:23.279> sat<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> couch<00:00:24.180> with

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
and actually just sat on the couch with

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.200 
and actually just sat on the couch with
the<00:00:25.039> camera<00:00:26.039> rolling<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.699> see<00:00:26.849> if<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.029> can

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the camera rolling and see if I can

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.120 
the camera rolling and see if I can
capture<00:00:27.449> him<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.590> specific<00:00:28.800> moment

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
capture him in that specific moment

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.440 
capture him in that specific moment
because<00:00:29.779> there<00:00:30.779> are<00:00:30.869> often<00:00:31.410> times<00:00:31.619> when<00:00:32.450> he

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
because there are often times when he

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.430 
because there are often times when he
does<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:33.989> certain<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.739> guess<00:00:35.840> actions<00:00:36.840> just

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
does like certain I guess actions just

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.709 
does like certain I guess actions just
it<00:00:38.010> makes<00:00:38.219> him<00:00:38.430> look<00:00:38.579> really<00:00:38.640> freaking<00:00:39.420> cute

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
it makes him look really freaking cute

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.030
