00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
at all that dirt man I think they did a

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.480

really<00:01:25.840> good<00:01:26.110> job<00:01:26.260> on<00:01:26.620> this<00:01:26.770> thing<00:01:27.040> this<00:01:27.220> looks

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
really good job on this thing this looks

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.600 
really good job on this thing this looks
damn<00:01:27.909> sweet<00:01:28.420> now<00:01:28.990> my<00:01:29.170> only<00:01:29.380> one<00:01:29.830> little<00:01:30.190> gripe

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
damn sweet now my only one little gripe

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.820 
damn sweet now my only one little gripe
with<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:30.970> figure<00:01:31.390> is<00:01:31.540> that<00:01:31.870> it<00:01:32.409> doesn't

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
with this figure is that it doesn't

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.160 
with this figure is that it doesn't
really<00:01:32.979> go<00:01:33.370> all<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:34.060> way<00:01:34.090> across<00:01:34.360> on<00:01:34.990> this

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
really go all the way across on this

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.039 
really go all the way across on this
dirt<00:01:35.470> mark<00:01:35.710> right<00:01:35.920> up<00:01:36.070> here<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.760> on<00:01:37.210> this<00:01:37.690> side

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
dirt mark right up here and on this side

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.260 
dirt mark right up here and on this side
over<00:01:38.290> here<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:39.430> doesn't<00:01:39.490> completely<00:01:40.000> match

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
over here so it doesn't completely match

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.880 
over here so it doesn't completely match
now<00:01:40.479> on<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.630> front<00:01:40.780> two<00:01:41.020> pieces<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.500> matches

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
now on the front two pieces it matches

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.440 
now on the front two pieces it matches
you<00:01:42.100> can<00:01:42.250> see<00:01:42.430> how<00:01:42.549> that<00:01:42.729> looks<00:01:42.970> consistent

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
you can see how that looks consistent

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.180 
you can see how that looks consistent
but<00:01:43.810> right<00:01:44.020> over<00:01:44.049> here<00:01:44.500> it's<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.799> little<00:01:45.010> off

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
but right over here it's a little off

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.000 
but right over here it's a little off
and<00:01:45.610> right<00:01:46.060> here<00:01:46.450> it's<00:01:46.659> just<00:01:46.930> not<00:01:47.110> totally

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
and right here it's just not totally

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.700 
and right here it's just not totally
consistent<00:01:48.430> so<00:01:48.820> that's<00:01:49.030> my<00:01:49.869> little<00:01:50.110> gripe<00:01:50.470> I

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
consistent so that's my little gripe I

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.710 
consistent so that's my little gripe I
really<00:01:51.190> like<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.549> plastic<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:52.330> they<00:01:52.390> use

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
really like the plastic that they use

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.600 
really like the plastic that they use
it's<00:01:52.960> not<00:01:53.140> like<00:01:53.320> these<00:01:53.500> sparkles<00:01:54.190> in<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.430> do

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
it's not like these sparkles in it do

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.930 
it's not like these sparkles in it do

this thing then the bat-signal itself

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.780 
this thing then the bat-signal itself
this<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.230> like<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.650> silver<00:03:09.130> paint<00:03:09.370> right<00:03:09.520> here

this is like a silver paint right here

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.960 
this is like a silver paint right here
on<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.570> convex<00:03:11.320> lens<00:03:11.740> so<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.340> does<00:03:12.550> stick<00:03:12.820> out

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970

moves<00:03:22.120> up<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.600> down<00:03:22.690> like<00:03:23.050> this<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:24.010> will

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
moves up and down like this and it will

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.470 
moves up and down like this and it will

really<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.450> complaint<00:03:37.930> of<00:03:37.990> mine<00:03:38.020> or<00:03:38.290> anything

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
really a complaint of mine or anything

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.500 
really a complaint of mine or anything
so<00:03:38.740> it<00:03:38.800> was<00:03:38.980> up<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:39.190> down<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:39.880> moves<00:03:40.120> side

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
so it was up and down and it moves side

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.990 
so it was up and down and it moves side
to<00:03:40.540> side<00:03:40.900> okay<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.410> when<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.040> move<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.310> 360<00:03:42.910> you

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
to side okay so when you move it 360 you

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.700 
to side okay so when you move it 360 you
gotta<00:03:43.210> be<00:03:43.330> careful<00:03:43.540> with<00:03:43.900> this<00:03:44.170> switch<00:03:44.680> right

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
gotta be careful with this switch right

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.670 
gotta be careful with this switch right
here<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.580> this<00:03:45.760> rotates<00:03:46.720> as<00:03:46.930> well<00:03:47.140> so<00:03:47.470> yeah

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
here and this rotates as well so yeah

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.680 
here and this rotates as well so yeah
don't<00:03:48.070> be<00:03:48.190> rough<00:03:48.400> with<00:03:48.490> your<00:03:48.700> bat<00:03:48.910> signals<00:03:49.420> and
