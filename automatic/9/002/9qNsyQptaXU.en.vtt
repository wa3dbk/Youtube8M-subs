00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.350
 I present the new combination of 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.730
 colors of the bid or speed the boot that 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.080
 more success has currently had between 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.420
 all the professional games of shoe 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.070
 the German brand and that initially 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.690
 Puma designed it thinking of taking advantage 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.430
 the virtues of the fastest games 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.110
 to get to exploit that speed 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.180
 but that has been convinced to all kinds 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.400
 of player because of his to his perfect 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.050
 adaptation and the technical nature of the housing 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.310
 that will not only enhance our 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.170
 speed but it will allow us 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.440
 have a good fit and a good and a good 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.440
 hit 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.150
 to begin with we say that they are materials 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 synthetics in microfiber how synthetic 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.690
 very light like all the boots that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.370
 they form this kind of line of boots 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.960
 lightweight manufactured in one piece 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.080
 we see that there is no seam in all 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.540
 the shell is a one-of-a-kind boot 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.590
 only piece and in the whole hitting area 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.790
 in all the areas that are going to enter 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.379
 contact with the ball in both 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.150
 internal areas as in the areas of 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.920
 front vamp and instep outer 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.210
 we see small inserts of a 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.130
 material similar to silicone a 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.930
 kind of gel that have to 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.430
 that to almost solve the problems 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.320
 bigger than we find this 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.820
 type of synthetic boots and is that the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.200
 ball and boot do not have enough 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.030
 grip then with these little 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.259
 gel insertions let's get that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.869
 the contact with the ball is very natural 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.240
 and at no time there is any loss 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.070
 of tension effect when hitting a ball 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.600
 to get better adjustment in this 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.820
 same area we find a table 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.930
 reinforced and a special fluff in the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.280
 Achilles tendon area for the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.930
 Fit the boot once we squeeze 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.930
 the string is perfect 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.910
 if we go on to talk about culture 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.800
 internal or chassis of this model of 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.270
 pen 2 pib we find that cougar 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.310
 introduces technology mainly 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.230
 in two points the first one is in 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.880
 the area of the template 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.770
 and as we can see once the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.200
 we bring you we find a complex 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.700
 yellow zone divided into 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.070
 different segments that really are 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.450
 the areas where we are going to go 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.060
 pivoting every time we do a support 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.500
 is this yellow foam is a foam 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.910
 of memory a foam that will absorb 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.920
 all the impacts that we make against the 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.560
 I soil both when we jump and in 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.700
 accelerated and very sharp braking of 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.500
 way that will absorb all the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.760
 impacts of the boot against the ground as 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.160
 we can see is a boot with a profile 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.480
 very low the second point of technology 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.640
 we are inside the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.920
 boot and what you will allow is that this 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.750
 area that we see marked in yellow 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.960
 which is called everfit once 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.640
 adjust the boot string 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.170
 since the rest of the area so 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.090
 allows some freedom to do 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.560
 movements this central area where is 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.120
 the ever fit will have a maximum adjustment 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.740
 in such a way that the body of the boot to 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.570
 the central part in the heart of the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.280
 boot does not suffer any kind of movement 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.240
 parasite when we make some very 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.240
 aggressive during the game 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.230
 and finally if we talk about the 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.700
 soled boot the new bos gdp us 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.800
 we found with a provision of tacos 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.930
 and very traditional cast that is tacos 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.870
 conical 4 in the outer zone a cue 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.640
 pivoting 3 in the inner zone and the game 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.290
 of 4 tacos for the area for the area of 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.060
 heel all the technology we the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.800
 we found in the bending points of 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.110
 the front part the area on which 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.290
 is going to flex our foot that cougars 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.820
 called flex and the central spine of the 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.860
 downtown area called speed track 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.320
 is an area that will allow you not to 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.880
 there is no bending on the bridge 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.080
 of the foot which would cause injuries and 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.030
 energy losses against race 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.160
 contributing if we press the boot we see 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.540
 that this area marked in salmon color does not 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.100
 is pressure in no time and also 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.640
 will give us support in the twists 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.640
 lateral 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.030
 besides guest model 1 which is the 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.490
 high- end model the top model where 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.960
 puma charges all its technology too 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.790
 we find model 2 and the 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.980
 model 3 a mid- range model and a 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.540
 first price the mid-range model 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.800
 it is still a very light material a 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.530
 material that still has all 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.910
 the different gel inserts or of 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.490
 silicone in the housing to have a 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.660
 good beating keeps on maintaining 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.420
 reinforcement in the heel area 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.740
 although we lose the internal structure of 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.360
 profile in yellow we had 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.410
 previously spoken also the fluffy 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.870
 of the template and the spirit area 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.550
 tracks that we could see in the model 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.020
 high end that gave a little bit of 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.570
 stability to the foot bridge without a name 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.100
 world flex tube is still maintained if 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.540
 we go to the lower range model 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.340
 we find that the same 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.140
 synthetic microfiber and leaving present 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.150
 no longer presents any type of insertion 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.920
 of gel in the entire entrance area of ​​the 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.050
 housing of course in some kind of 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.790
 internal technology and when we go to 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.350
 talk about the sole we found that 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.670
 the flex duo is kept but that 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.740
 we lose of course the zone of 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.740
 spectral at the skin point
