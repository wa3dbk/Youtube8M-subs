00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.560 

this<00:00:21.910> is<00:00:22.390> how<00:00:22.630> it<00:00:22.779> looks<00:00:23.019> I<00:00:23.849> don't<00:00:24.849> know<00:00:25.269> if<00:00:25.449> you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
this is how it looks I don't know if you

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.749 
this is how it looks I don't know if you
can<00:00:25.689> see<00:00:25.900> it<00:00:26.020> very<00:00:26.169> well<00:00:26.289> but<00:00:26.619> it<00:00:26.770> has<00:00:27.039> a<00:00:27.369> little

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
can see it very well but it has a little

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.510 
can see it very well but it has a little
dots<00:00:28.210> it<00:00:28.779> smell<00:00:29.020> like<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.680> paint<00:00:29.949> with<00:00:30.220> little

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520

dots and I think you can see it so yeah

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.290 
dots and I think you can see it so yeah
that<00:00:36.850> kind<00:00:37.239> of<00:00:37.360> paint<00:00:37.629> shouldn't<00:00:38.080> be<00:00:38.230> possible

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
that kind of paint shouldn't be possible

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.060 
that kind of paint shouldn't be possible
or<00:00:40.300> for<00:00:40.570> some<00:00:40.750> other<00:00:40.839> spot<00:00:41.110> because<00:00:41.379> it<00:00:41.589> has

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
or for some other spot because it has

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.819 
or for some other spot because it has
metallic<00:00:42.580> paint<00:00:42.850> with<00:00:43.720> metallic<00:00:44.110> paint<00:00:44.350> dots

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
metallic paint with metallic paint dots

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.069 
metallic paint with metallic paint dots
and<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:47.559> many<00:00:47.829> does<00:00:48.040> you<00:00:48.370> see<00:00:48.579> you'd<00:00:49.420> so<00:00:49.780> ran

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
and that many does you see you'd so ran

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.960 
and that many does you see you'd so ran
out<00:00:50.350> of<00:00:50.379> layers<00:00:50.769> if<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:51.100> try<00:00:51.309> to<00:00:51.370> make<00:00:51.610> every

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
out of layers if you try to make every

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.149 
out of layers if you try to make every
dose<00:00:52.150> by<00:00:52.360> yourself<00:00:52.839> but<00:00:53.470> as<00:00:53.619> you<00:00:53.769> can<00:00:53.890> see<00:00:54.100> it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
dose by yourself but as you can see it

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.340 
dose by yourself but as you can see it
only<00:00:54.489> has<00:00:54.879> 130<00:00:55.809> warm<00:00:56.170> layers<00:00:56.650> both<00:00:57.040> side<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
only has 130 warm layers both side so

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:07.060 
only has 130 warm layers both side so
let's<00:01:00.129> just<00:01:00.339> make<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.549> new<00:01:00.760> one<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.710> by<00:01:03.040> a<00:01:03.070> car

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
we're here black so now this car has

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.219 
we're here black so now this car has
gloss<00:01:46.180> danger<00:01:47.180> as<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:47.900> can<00:01:48.050> see<00:01:49.510> it<00:01:50.510> has<00:01:50.780> no

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.330 
and then go to the paint across section
of<00:02:02.720> course<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.080> don't<00:02:03.260> have<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.590> do<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:03.860> if

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
of course you don't have to do this if

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.640 
of course you don't have to do this if
you<00:02:04.580> are<00:02:04.670> doing<00:02:04.850> this<00:02:05.119> by<00:02:05.420> yourself<00:02:05.450> I'm<00:02:06.380> just

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
you are doing this by yourself I'm just

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.070 
you are doing this by yourself I'm just
demonstrating<00:02:06.830> why<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:07.970> works<00:02:08.300> only<00:02:08.570> in

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
demonstrating why this works only in

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.340 
demonstrating why this works only in
some<00:02:09.530> cars<00:02:10.540> here<00:02:11.540> we<00:02:11.660> are<00:02:11.690> with<00:02:12.230> normal<00:02:12.650> colors

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
some cars here we are with normal colors

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.990 
some cars here we are with normal colors
here<00:02:15.350> we<00:02:15.470> are<00:02:15.500> with<00:02:15.680> metallic<00:02:16.220> cars<00:02:16.459> as<00:02:16.670> you

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
here we are with metallic cars as you

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.570 
here we are with metallic cars as you
can<00:02:17.150> see<00:02:17.330> you<00:02:17.660> can<00:02:17.870> see<00:02:17.989> straight<00:02:18.500> through

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.870 

through<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:23.320> black<00:02:24.320> layer<00:02:24.650> which<00:02:24.980> made<00:02:25.400> black

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
through the black layer which made black

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.500 
through the black layer which made black
square<00:02:27.010> becomes<00:02:28.010> transparent<00:02:28.640> if<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.330> make

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
square becomes transparent if you make

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.620 
square becomes transparent if you make
whole<00:02:29.870> car<00:02:30.610> with<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.820> you'll<00:02:32.180> get<00:02:32.390> in

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
whole car with that you'll get in

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.890 
whole car with that you'll get in
constant<00:02:33.489> type<00:02:34.489> of<00:02:34.670> god<00:02:34.850> or<00:02:35.030> chrome<00:02:35.390> colors

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
constant type of god or chrome colors

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.820 
constant type of god or chrome colors
like<00:02:36.110> some<00:02:36.140> toys<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:39.440> looks<00:02:39.650> pretty

make<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:44.090> then<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.600> will<00:02:44.780> continue<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:47.290> do

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
make that and then I will continue to do

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.790 
make that and then I will continue to do
the<00:02:48.410> candy<00:02:48.830> paint<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:50.630> is<00:02:50.989> how<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:51.950> looks

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
the candy paint so this is how it looks

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.059 
the candy paint so this is how it looks
basically

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
basically

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.670 
basically
so<00:02:56.819> all<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.239> have<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.719> is<00:02:57.870> have<00:02:58.140> Richard

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
so all you have to do is have Richard

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.479 
so all you have to do is have Richard
car<00:02:59.030> have<00:03:00.030> special<00:03:00.569> color<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.109> it<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.530> put

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
car have special color in it and put

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.660 
car have special color in it and put
black<00:03:02.879> square<00:03:03.390> on<00:03:03.689> it<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:05.040> works<00:03:05.310> with<00:03:05.459> any

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
black square on it this works with any

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.020 
black square on it this works with any
color<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.299> course<00:03:06.689> not<00:03:06.840> with<00:03:06.989> black<00:03:07.530> color

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
color of course not with black color

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.910 
color of course not with black color
because<00:03:09.030> then<00:03:09.569> it's<00:03:09.689> just<00:03:09.780> black<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.680> yeah

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
because then it's just black but yeah

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.780 
because then it's just black but yeah
with<00:03:11.159> any<00:03:11.370> other<00:03:11.579> course<00:03:13.189> so<00:03:14.189> this<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.579> how<00:03:14.700> it

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
with any other course so this is how it

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.970 
with any other course so this is how it
looks<00:03:15.060> some<00:03:15.629> people<00:03:15.900> think<00:03:16.079> this<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.319> great<00:03:16.769> I

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
looks some people think this is great I

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.589 
looks some people think this is great I
think<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:17.430> annoying<00:03:17.700> because<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.239> can't<00:03:18.480> make

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
think it's annoying because I can't make

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.729 
think it's annoying because I can't make
good<00:03:18.959> kissers<00:03:21.200> because<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.319> can<00:03:22.439> see<00:03:22.560> it'll

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
good kissers because you can see it'll

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.059 
good kissers because you can see it'll
straight<00:03:23.400> through<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.760> loggers<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.090> stuff

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
straight through the loggers and stuff

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.009 
straight through the loggers and stuff
so<00:03:26.069> yeah<00:03:26.430> what<00:03:26.639> we<00:03:26.969> are<00:03:27.060> going<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.359> do<00:03:27.480> now<00:03:27.659> is

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
so yeah what we are going to do now is

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.800 
so yeah what we are going to do now is
he<00:03:28.170> candy<00:03:28.530> paint<00:03:28.760> we<00:03:29.760> will<00:03:29.790> use<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.239> one<00:03:30.480> that

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
he candy paint we will use this one that

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.199 
he candy paint we will use this one that
many<00:03:31.079> people<00:03:31.290> use<00:03:32.239> in<00:03:34.700> what<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.909> comes<00:03:36.120> with

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
many people use in what is it comes with

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.379 
many people use in what is it comes with
um<00:03:36.530> carbon<00:03:37.530> fiber<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:40.879> lot<00:03:41.879> of<00:03:41.970> people<00:03:42.239> make

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
um carbon fiber a lot of people make

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.839 
um carbon fiber a lot of people make
carbon<00:03:42.780> fiber<00:03:42.989> with<00:03:43.200> this<00:03:43.349> layer<00:03:43.560> I'll<00:03:44.549> just

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
carbon fiber with this layer I'll just

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.619 
carbon fiber with this layer I'll just
make<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.060> very<00:03:45.299> small<00:03:46.970> then<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.060> will<00:03:48.209> group<00:03:48.480> it

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
make it very small then I will group it

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.909 
make it very small then I will group it
and<00:03:48.840> with<00:03:49.230> more<00:03:49.500> science<00:03:50.180> why<00:03:51.180> did<00:03:51.389> I<00:03:51.480> do<00:03:51.540> that

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
and with more science why did I do that

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:59.800 
and with more science why did I do that
it's<00:03:52.919> because<00:03:53.340> stop<00:03:53.939> it<00:03:55.189> now<00:03:56.189> it<00:03:56.310> has<00:03:57.349> 36<00:03:58.349> point

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
it's because stop it now it has 36 point

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.059 
it's because stop it now it has 36 point
75044<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.409> would<00:04:01.590> take<00:04:02.150> forever<00:04:03.859> if<00:04:04.859> you

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
75044 and I would take forever if you

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.640 
75044 and I would take forever if you
just<00:04:05.489> do<00:04:05.699> it<00:04:05.760> normally<00:04:06.389> so<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:07.379> is<00:04:07.500> quite

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
just do it normally so this is quite

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.219 
just do it normally so this is quite
glitching<00:04:08.389> this<00:04:09.389> will<00:04:09.569> be<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.750> knowing<00:04:10.019> when

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:10.229 
glitching this will be a knowing when

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:11.629 
glitching this will be a knowing when
you<00:04:10.319> are<00:04:10.470> doing<00:04:10.650> this<00:04:10.859> by<00:04:11.069> yourself<00:04:11.099> because

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
you are doing this by yourself because

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:16.789 
you are doing this by yourself because
it's<00:04:11.879> glitchy<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:14.430> can't<00:04:14.729> really<00:04:14.909> see<00:04:15.739> how<00:04:16.739> it

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
it's glitchy you can't really see how it

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.640 
it's glitchy you can't really see how it
should<00:04:17.099> look

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.780 

that<00:04:21.220> looks<00:04:21.459> very<00:04:21.519> stupid<00:04:22.330> Oh<00:04:23.580> actually<00:04:24.580> I

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
that looks very stupid Oh actually I

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.120 
that looks very stupid Oh actually I
just<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:25.120> song<00:04:25.450> wait

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
just a song wait

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.160 
just a song wait
oh<00:04:28.160> yeah<00:04:28.850> now<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.060> looks<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.480> bit<00:04:29.510> better

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.650 

I<00:04:34.200> will<00:04:34.920> make<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.250> perfect<00:04:35.430> now<00:04:35.790> because<00:04:36.540> it

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
I will make it perfect now because it

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.130 
I will make it perfect now because it
will<00:04:36.720> take<00:04:36.990> time<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:39.120> was<00:04:39.300> pretty<00:04:39.540> good

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
will take time it was pretty good

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.700 
will take time it was pretty good
last<00:04:41.130> time<00:04:41.630> cuz<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.690> had<00:04:42.840> more<00:04:43.050> time<00:04:43.320> with<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:43.590> I

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
last time cuz I had more time with it I

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.770 
last time cuz I had more time with it I
won't<00:04:43.980> make<00:04:44.280> my<00:04:44.310> youtube<00:04:44.910> videos<00:04:45.210> very<00:04:45.540> long

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
won't make my youtube videos very long

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.280 
won't make my youtube videos very long
because<00:04:46.020> then<00:04:46.380> nobody<00:04:46.560> would<00:04:46.830> watch<00:04:47.040> them<00:04:48.290> or

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
because then nobody would watch them or

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.110 
because then nobody would watch them or
they<00:04:49.410> would<00:04:49.500> just<00:04:49.830> start<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.460> they<00:04:50.580> just<00:04:50.850> they

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
they would just start and they just they

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.330 
they would just start and they just they
would<00:04:51.240> start<00:04:52.050> skipping<00:04:52.500> past<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.040> that

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
would start skipping past and that

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.700 
would start skipping past and that
leaves<00:04:53.910> that<00:04:54.330> they<00:04:54.510> would<00:04:54.690> hear<00:04:55.580> all<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:57.000> tips

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
leaves that they would hear all the tips

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.160 
leaves that they would hear all the tips
I'm<00:04:58.710> telling<00:04:59.190> then<00:05:00.150> it's<00:05:00.300> just<00:05:00.420> spin<00:05:00.720> it<00:05:00.840> and

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
I'm telling then it's just spin it and

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.720 
I'm telling then it's just spin it and
spin<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.370> spin<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.150> spin<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:04.400> spin<00:05:05.400> many

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
spin and spin it and spin it spin many

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.910 
spin and spin it and spin it spin many
times<00:05:05.970> you<00:05:06.570> could<00:05:06.690> spin<00:05:07.140> as<00:05:07.410> many<00:05:07.620> times<00:05:07.830> as

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
times you could spin as many times as

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.290 
times you could spin as many times as
you<00:05:08.040> want<00:05:08.190> but<00:05:08.370> it<00:05:08.520> gets<00:05:08.960> darker<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.140> darker

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
you want but it gets darker and darker

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.240 
you want but it gets darker and darker
now<00:05:12.300> we<00:05:12.660> will<00:05:12.780> put<00:05:12.960> it<00:05:13.080> in<00:05:13.290> red<00:05:13.680> color<00:05:14.070> the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
now we will put it in red color the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.290 
now we will put it in red color the
status<00:05:14.640> of<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.360> chorus<00:05:16.640> is<00:05:17.640> actually<00:05:18.090> a<00:05:18.120> bit

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
status of the chorus is actually a bit
