to<00:00:48.329> use<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.600> juggernaut<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.440> use<00:00:49.680> ACOG<00:00:50.190> with

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
to use a juggernaut but I use ACOG with

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.959 
to use a juggernaut but I use ACOG with
extended<00:00:51.270> mags<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.809> because<00:00:52.340> every<00:00:53.340> time<00:00:53.820> you

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
extended mags so because every time you

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.910 
extended mags so because every time you
run<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.390> clip<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.079> only<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.440> clip

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
run out of a clip you only get one clip

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.730 
run out of a clip you only get one clip
and<00:00:56.160> then<00:00:56.250> after<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.120> clip<00:00:57.420> then<00:00:57.719> um

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
and then after that one clip then um

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.560 
and then after that one clip then um
then<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.580> have<00:00:59.700> to<00:00:59.820> redo<00:01:00.000> Coolidge<00:01:00.300> every

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
then you have to redo Coolidge every

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.540 
then you have to redo Coolidge every
time<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.840> die<00:01:01.080> and<00:01:01.860> you<00:01:02.010> spawn<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
time you die and you spawn you have to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.090 
time you die and you spawn you have to
redo<00:01:02.790> good<00:01:03.060> so<00:01:03.440> yeah<00:01:04.440> that's<00:01:04.620> why<00:01:04.740> I<00:01:04.770> put

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100

basically why I use and you do it for um

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.429 
basically why I use and you do it for um
like<00:02:02.899> I<00:02:03.899> said<00:02:03.929> any<00:02:04.380> any<00:02:04.770> sniper<00:02:05.130> song<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.789> doing

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
like I said any any sniper song be doing

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.130 
like I said any any sniper song be doing
I<00:02:07.000> guess<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.119> need<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.330> be<00:02:08.509> here<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:08.899> I'll<00:02:08.959> make

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
I guess I need to be here so I'll make

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.690 
I guess I need to be here so I'll make
two<00:02:09.350> classes<00:02:09.890> for<00:02:10.130> this<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:13.100> yeah<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.280> guess

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
two classes for this so yeah I guess

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.729 
two classes for this so yeah I guess
that<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.150> site<00:02:14.420> really<00:02:14.840> doesn't<00:02:15.260> matter<00:02:15.440> for

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
that the site really doesn't matter for

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.050 
that the site really doesn't matter for
the<00:02:15.860> V<00:02:17.680> for<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.709> ACOG<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.370> just<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.760> don't<00:02:19.910> know

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
even though it does nothing it's just a

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.810

personally I think it makes it a little
harder<00:06:30.560> but<00:06:31.430> yeah<00:06:31.610> people<00:06:31.820> just<00:06:32.150> don't<00:06:32.240> know

very<00:06:57.230> fast<00:06:57.350> and<00:06:57.950> it's<00:06:58.400> pretty<00:06:58.730> easy<00:06:58.910> um<00:06:59.300> the

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
very fast and it's pretty easy um the

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.570 
very fast and it's pretty easy um the
thing<00:07:00.080> is<00:07:00.110> getting<00:07:00.530> long<00:07:00.890> range<00:07:01.190> kills<00:07:01.430> with

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
thing is getting long range kills with

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.100 
thing is getting long range kills with
it<00:07:01.730> it's<00:07:01.910> actually<00:07:02.060> pretty<00:07:02.420> hard<00:07:02.660> since<00:07:02.870> as

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
it it's actually pretty hard since as

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.570 
it it's actually pretty hard since as
you<00:07:03.230> can<00:07:03.380> see<00:07:03.560> there's<00:07:03.800> like<00:07:03.950> no<00:07:04.160> scope<00:07:04.430> or

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
you can see there's like no scope or

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.040 
you can see there's like no scope or
anything<00:07:04.730> like<00:07:05.000> that<00:07:05.060> so<00:07:05.720> it's<00:07:05.810> actually

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
anything like that so it's actually

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.320 
anything like that so it's actually
pretty<00:07:06.200> hard<00:07:06.470> to<00:07:06.530> get<00:07:06.680> some<00:07:06.860> long<00:07:07.670> long<00:07:08.000> range

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
pretty hard to get some long long range

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.200 
pretty hard to get some long long range
