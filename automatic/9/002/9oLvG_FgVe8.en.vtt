00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
to work and we also have expressed keys

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.530 
to work and we also have expressed keys
and<00:01:31.799> touch<00:01:31.950> strips<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.400> side<00:01:32.520> these<00:01:33.390> allow

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540
