00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:09.790
 here is apple blog DE I'm on grad 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.589
 Hawaii beach on the mobile world 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.500
 congress in barcelona and there we have 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.810
 finally the huawei mediapad the link 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.850
 also announced accelerate left in 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.630
 Seen the past months and 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.640
 had heard 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.800
 now it has been here on the 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.270
 Fair just announced is like her 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.640
 can see a 10 inch tablet and 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.590
 very reminiscent of the MediaPad dvd the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.450
 last year was presented here but 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.980
 only appeared a few months ago 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.039
 They had a long time back then 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.839
 heads up now comes new model has one 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.789
 But there are a few other features 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.170
 basically the same thing there is 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.149
 really little difference between 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.579
 live a tablet at least you have me 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.170
 still a 10.1 inch display 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.100
 the resolution is only 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.280
 However, 1280 x 800 pixels is ps and the 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.909
 Viewing angles are also alright 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.589
 under it really has one 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.289
 quad-core processor depending on the model 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.249
 at 1.4 gigahertz or 1 2 gigahertz 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.519
 is clocked 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:06.880
 this is the cafÃ© k 3 v 2 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.320
 huawei's own is a cortex a9 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.140
 we have in general as I said 1.4 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.180
 gigahertz or 1.2 gigahertz the same 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.580
 is also watching the ram it will be 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.229
 So two versions give once with 1 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.340
 gigabyte of RAM once with two 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.259
 gigabytes of memory 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.390
 the exact prices for each 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.710
 However, version stand to this 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.289
 time not yet determined 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.450
 Of course, there is also memory 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.780
 differentiate once more active at 16 gb 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.909
 or 32 GB of flash memory 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.700
 However, you can use the 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.360
 about a micro sd card slot anyway 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.640
 upgrade 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.090
 Optionally it will be a model with LTE 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.800
 and released and we go 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.200
 Just take the huawei mediapad ten 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.890
 around the left we have his up here 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.360
 Camera nothing else except the display 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.390
 with a black frame already 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.840
 pretty much stocked with fingerprints 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.330
 is 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.610
 then we have here at the side 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.850
 headset or an output one 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.950
 micro usb connection and nothing here then 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.090
 a volume rocker and a power 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.250
 button continues to hides just like that 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.990
 a flap here is the micro 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.230
 sd card slot but also the sim 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.739
 card slot if you have the module resp 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.480
 Last version or 3g versions 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.130
 on the back we have one more 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.410
 Unfortunately, we can not handle the camera 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.410
 megapixel number you should be here with 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.300
 every case by ddos I go that 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.010
 I honestly could say that 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.020
 not the best camera now 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.660
 the back there was nice the aluminum 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.050
 general the huawei mediapad 10 link 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.200
 It is not winter that works well 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.250
 tablet 99 mm could fit a centimeter 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.970
 be a bit thinner 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.230
 especially the experiment for tablets by 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.900
 sony can 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.860
 but if the price is right, yes 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.040
 then still okay 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.250
 detroit unfortunately it runs android 4.0 ice 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.380
 cream sandwich that is unfortunately something there 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.019
 the data has to work as well 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.920
 here if all with growth selfridges 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.220
 stated and we do not know if it 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.290
 when it appears as 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.630
 and with jelly bean running or whether one 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.100
 update will be out unfortunately 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.380
 not but if it really with as 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.840
 Concert then you should also 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.150
 huawei mediapad does not grab anyway 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.370
 if serbia gives or at least one 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.960
 update really promise us 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.060
 then you can appear now 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.430
 consider the huawei mediapad ten left 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.410
 to pick if the price is right and 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.610
 I'm at chips for tablet blog.de that 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.720
 was a first impression of huawei 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.920
 mediapad 10 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.920
 Thank you for seeing
