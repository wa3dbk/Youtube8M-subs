here I'm gonna show you how you can
paint<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.969> watercolor<00:00:15.929> paper<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.560> what

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
paint on watercolor paper so what

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.980 
paint on watercolor paper so what
happens<00:00:17.580> when<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.880> paint<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.300> acrylic<00:00:18.810> and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
happens when you paint with acrylic and

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.410 
happens when you paint with acrylic and
water<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.590> dilutes<00:00:20.340> acrylic<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:20.970> makes<00:00:21.180> it

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
water it dilutes acrylic and makes it

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.279 
water it dilutes acrylic and makes it
look<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.260> watercolors<00:00:23.689> so<00:00:24.689> if<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.199> are

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
look like watercolors so if you are

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.960 
look like watercolors so if you are
looking<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.920> watercolor<00:00:26.460> effect

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
looking for a watercolor effect

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.820 
looking for a watercolor effect
basically<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.410> take<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
basically you just have to take the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.609 
basically you just have to take the
acrylic<00:00:29.220> paint<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.810> I<00:00:30.810> looted<00:00:31.170> with<00:00:31.320> water

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
acrylic paint and I looted with water

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.440 
acrylic paint and I looted with water
and<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> don't<00:00:32.070> want<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> use<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.730> large<00:00:32.969> amount

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
and you don't want to use a large amount

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.940 
and you don't want to use a large amount
of<00:00:34.160> paint<00:00:35.420> so<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.840> one<00:00:37.020> example<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.739> just

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
of paint so this is one example of just

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.650 
of paint so this is one example of just
making<00:00:39.649> creating<00:00:40.649> different<00:00:41.129> washes<00:00:41.660> some

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
making creating different washes some

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.380 
making creating different washes some
pass<00:00:42.870> those<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.410> technique<00:00:43.739> where<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.390> use

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
pass those that technique where you use

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.490 
pass those that technique where you use
a<00:00:45.420> lot<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:47.059> expressive<00:00:48.059> marks<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.260> layer

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
a lot of expressive marks and you layer

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.069 
a lot of expressive marks and you layer
the<00:00:49.770> paint<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.309> rather<00:00:51.120> than<00:00:51.329> mix<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.899> with

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the paint on rather than mix it with

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.889 
the paint on rather than mix it with
water<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.520> still<00:00:53.640> dip<00:00:54.510> your<00:00:54.719> brush

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
water you can still dip your brush

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.229 
water you can still dip your brush
everyone's<00:00:55.530> into<00:00:55.890> water<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.460> mainly<00:00:56.760> it's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
everyone's into water but mainly it's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.950 
everyone's into water but mainly it's
about<00:00:58.309> expressive<00:00:59.309> marks<00:00:59.730> also<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.629> could

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
about expressive marks also you could

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.039 
about expressive marks also you could
try<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.949> apply<00:01:02.430> your<00:01:02.730> paint<00:01:04.489> with<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> knife<00:01:06.049> so

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
try and apply your paint with a knife so

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.980 
try and apply your paint with a knife so
this<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.380> more<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.710> an<00:01:07.830> impasto<00:01:08.520> look<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
this is more of an impasto look and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.480 
this is more of an impasto look and
what's<00:01:10.170> fun<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.250> move

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
what's fun is that you can really move

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.570 
what's fun is that you can really move
around<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.330> scratch<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.439> surface<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.340> your

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
around and scratch the surface with your

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.859 
around and scratch the surface with your
painting<00:01:15.570> knife<00:01:16.909> now<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> would<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> show

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
painting knife now I would like to show

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.380 
painting knife now I would like to show
you<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.650> watercolor<00:01:20.369> techniques<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.360> is

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
you to the watercolor techniques one is

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.490 
you to the watercolor techniques one is
called<00:01:21.869> wet<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.070> wet<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.960> other<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.350> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
called wet on wet and the other one is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.210 
called wet on wet and the other one is
called<00:01:25.799> wet<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.549> dry<00:01:27.049> for<00:01:28.049> wet<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.650> wet<00:01:28.680> you're

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
called wet on dry for wet on wet you're

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.940 
called wet on dry for wet on wet you're
basically<00:01:29.790> adding<00:01:30.299> colors<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:31.650> another

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
basically adding colors to one another

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.999 
basically adding colors to one another
while<00:01:32.250> they're<00:01:32.460> wet<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.710> wet<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.979> dry

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
while they're wet for the wet on dry

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.600 
while they're wet for the wet on dry
you're<00:01:35.939> applying<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.780> layer<00:01:37.369> allowing<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
you're applying a layer allowing it to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.330 
you're applying a layer allowing it to
dry<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:39.990> going<00:01:40.350> over<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:40.979> adding

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
dry and then going over it and adding

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.030 
dry and then going over it and adding
another<00:01:41.610> layer<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.390> when<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.869> create<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.680> wet

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
another layer so when you create the wet

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.330 
another layer so when you create the wet
on<00:01:44.280> wet<00:01:44.310> effect<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.600> makes<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.890> work<00:01:47.100> look

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
on wet effect it makes your work look

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.880 
on wet effect it makes your work look
very<00:01:47.610> spontaneous<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.990> allows<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> lot

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
very spontaneous and it allows for a lot

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.120 
very spontaneous and it allows for a lot
of<00:01:50.040> accidents<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.759> bleeding<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.890> wet<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.100> dry

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
of accidents and bleeding and wet on dry

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.490 
of accidents and bleeding and wet on dry
allows<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.329> layer<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.930> make<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.320> look

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
allows you to layer and make it look

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.819 
allows you to layer and make it look
more<00:01:55.710> realistic<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.520> refined<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.619> I'm<00:01:58.619> just

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
more realistic and refined so I'm just

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.240 
more realistic and refined so I'm just
gonna<00:01:58.950> show<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.630> both<00:02:00.630> techniques<00:02:01.229> any<00:02:01.950> time

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
gonna show you both techniques any time

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.850 
gonna show you both techniques any time
when<00:02:02.369> you're<00:02:02.490> working<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.860> watercolor

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
when you're working with a watercolor

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.809 
when you're working with a watercolor
paper<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.840> watercolor<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.380> map<00:02:08.250> out<00:02:08.459> a

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
paper and watercolor you can map out a

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.550 
paper and watercolor you can map out a
large<00:02:09.149> area<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> wet<00:02:10.530> brush

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
large area with a wet brush

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.640 
large area with a wet brush
and<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:12.160> allows<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.700> paint<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.450> flow<00:02:13.930> freely

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
and that allows the paint to flow freely

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.230 
and that allows the paint to flow freely
and<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:16.300> also<00:02:16.450> allows<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.200> create<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:18.240> nice

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
and it also allows you to create a nice

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.380 
and it also allows you to create a nice
even<00:02:19.750> surface<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.660> will<00:02:23.650> be<00:02:23.800> my<00:02:24.150> wet<00:02:25.150> on

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
even surface so this will be my wet on

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.449 
even surface so this will be my wet on
dry<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.900> I'm<00:02:25.959> gonna<00:02:26.110> let<00:02:26.350> this<00:02:26.410> section<00:02:27.010> dry

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
dry so I'm gonna let this section dry

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.000 
dry so I'm gonna let this section dry
and<00:02:27.819> I'm<00:02:28.300> gonna<00:02:28.480> work<00:02:28.750> with<00:02:29.050> this<00:02:29.260> section<00:02:29.800> I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
and I'm gonna work with this section I

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.760 
and I'm gonna work with this section I
can<00:02:30.220> start<00:02:30.700> going<00:02:30.910> in<00:02:31.239> with<00:02:31.450> other<00:02:31.660> colors<00:02:32.230> and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
can start going in with other colors and

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.470 
can start going in with other colors and
these<00:02:33.069> colors<00:02:33.340> will<00:02:33.760> be<00:02:33.910> bleeding<00:02:34.360> in

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
these colors will be bleeding in

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.990 
these colors will be bleeding in
together<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:36.100> see<00:02:36.340> they<00:02:36.580> create

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
together and you can see they create

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000 
together and you can see they create
these<00:02:39.390> kind<00:02:40.390> of<00:02:40.510> hairy<00:02:40.840> edges<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:41.770> be

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
these kind of hairy edges that can be

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.830 
these kind of hairy edges that can be
really<00:02:42.280> beautiful<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.090> can<00:02:43.120> go<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.660> with

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
really beautiful and you can go in with

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.520 
really beautiful and you can go in with
more<00:02:44.200> intense<00:02:44.590> colors<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:46.300> also<00:02:46.840> depending

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
more intense colors and also depending

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.000 
more intense colors and also depending
on<00:02:47.680> how<00:02:47.920> this<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.580> drying<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:50.530> know<00:02:50.709> if<00:02:50.860> it's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
on how this is drying you know if it's

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.140 
on how this is drying you know if it's
still<00:02:51.130> really<00:02:51.519> wet

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
still really wet

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.020 
still really wet
it<00:02:53.080> might<00:02:53.380> not<00:02:53.590> bleed<00:02:53.860> as<00:02:54.070> much<00:02:54.280> as<00:02:54.550> areas<00:02:55.000> that

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
it might not bleed as much as areas that

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.100 
it might not bleed as much as areas that
are<00:02:55.360> already<00:02:55.870> drying<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:56.650> are<00:02:56.890> still<00:02:57.160> damp<00:02:58.110> so

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
are already drying but are still damp so

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.360 
are already drying but are still damp so
this<00:02:59.350> allows<00:02:59.680> you<00:03:00.069> for<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.850> lot<00:03:01.090> more

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
this allows you for a lot more

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.280 
this allows you for a lot more
spontaneity

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290

spontaneity
well<00:03:05.290> my<00:03:05.470> area<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.010> drying<00:03:06.430> in<00:03:06.640> here<00:03:06.970> I'm<00:03:07.120> going

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
well my area is drying in here I'm going

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.850 
well my area is drying in here I'm going
to<00:03:07.360> show<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.660> also<00:03:07.989> how<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.410> can<00:03:08.709> create

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
to show you also how you can create

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.470 
to show you also how you can create
washes<00:03:09.430> with<00:03:09.580> color<00:03:09.850> ink<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:12.489> will<00:03:12.700> see

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
washes with color ink and you will see

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.229 
washes with color ink and you will see
how<00:03:13.780> similar<00:03:14.470> ink<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.430> watercolor<00:03:15.970> but

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
how similar ink is to watercolor but

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.080 
how similar ink is to watercolor but
it's<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.540> lot<00:03:16.690> more<00:03:16.870> intense<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.829> it<00:03:18.670> can<00:03:18.850> give

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
it's a lot more intense and it can give

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.410 
it's a lot more intense and it can give
you<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.360> better<00:03:19.900> bleeding<00:03:20.829> effect<00:03:21.329> there<00:03:22.329> are

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
you a better bleeding effect there are

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.710 
you a better bleeding effect there are
two<00:03:23.019> types<00:03:23.350> of<00:03:23.590> ink<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:24.329> you<00:03:25.329> can<00:03:25.540> buy

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
two types of ink that you can buy

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.660 
two types of ink that you can buy
there's<00:03:26.170> water-based<00:03:26.739> ink<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.459> there's

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
there's water-based ink and there's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.780 
there's water-based ink and there's
acrylic<00:03:28.209> based<00:03:28.450> ink<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.140> they<00:03:29.829> look<00:03:30.519> pretty

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
acrylic based ink and they look pretty

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.900 
acrylic based ink and they look pretty
similar<00:03:31.090> but<00:03:31.510> acrylic<00:03:32.049> based<00:03:32.290> ink<00:03:32.760> which<00:03:33.760> is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
similar but acrylic based ink which is

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.410 
similar but acrylic based ink which is
what<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.090> have<00:03:34.390> right<00:03:34.630> here<00:03:34.660> is<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.920> lot<00:03:36.420> thicker

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
what I have right here is a lot thicker

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.620 
what I have right here is a lot thicker
and<00:03:37.810> more<00:03:38.140> intense<00:03:38.560> so<00:03:38.860> you're<00:03:39.100> able<00:03:40.090> to<00:03:40.359> get

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
and more intense so you're able to get

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.550 
and more intense so you're able to get
much<00:03:41.070> brighter<00:03:42.070> colors<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.930> can<00:03:44.140> get<00:03:44.350> really

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
much brighter colors you can get really

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.120 
much brighter colors you can get really
really<00:03:44.680> light<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:47.400> know<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:48.570> transparent

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
really light you know and transparent

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.030 
really light you know and transparent
just<00:03:51.130> as<00:03:51.310> with<00:03:51.489> watercolor<00:03:52.410> or<00:03:53.410> you<00:03:53.680> can<00:03:53.859> go

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
just as with watercolor or you can go

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.380 
just as with watercolor or you can go
and<00:03:54.810> with<00:03:55.810> much<00:03:56.049> more<00:03:56.380> intense<00:03:56.739> darker<00:03:57.390> colors

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
and with much more intense darker colors

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.699 
and with much more intense darker colors
you<00:03:59.290> can<00:03:59.500> also<00:03:59.769> create<00:04:00.190> very<00:04:00.489> flat<00:04:00.910> shapes

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
you can also create very flat shapes

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.130 
you can also create very flat shapes
when<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:02.739> say<00:04:03.040> flat<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.609> mean<00:04:03.940> there<00:04:04.840> won't<00:04:04.989> be

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
when I say flat I mean there won't be

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.360 
when I say flat I mean there won't be
variation<00:04:06.010> in<00:04:06.329> their<00:04:07.329> hues<00:04:08.160> there<00:04:09.160> will<00:04:09.340> be

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
variation in their hues there will be

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.580 
variation in their hues there will be
one<00:04:09.670> color<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:11.680> won't<00:04:11.950> vary<00:04:12.609> from<00:04:13.500> dark<00:04:14.500> to

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
one color it won't vary from dark to

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.289 
one color it won't vary from dark to
light

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
light

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.050 
light
here<00:04:17.079> I<00:04:17.109> have<00:04:17.409> my<00:04:17.560> quill<00:04:17.949> and<00:04:18.220> I<00:04:18.639> just<00:04:18.849> want<00:04:19.000> to

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
here I have my quill and I just want to

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.020 
here I have my quill and I just want to
show<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.359> how<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.829> can<00:04:21.009> incorporate<00:04:21.430> line

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
show you how you can incorporate line

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.600 
show you how you can incorporate line
drawing<00:04:22.629> into<00:04:23.050> your<00:04:23.849> color<00:04:24.849> ink<00:04:25.300> washes<00:04:26.610> you

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
drawing into your color ink washes you

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.600 
drawing into your color ink washes you
will<00:04:27.789> see<00:04:28.030> areas<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.659> are<00:04:28.930> still<00:04:29.080> wet<00:04:29.580> when<00:04:30.580> I

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
will see areas that are still wet when I

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.600 
will see areas that are still wet when I
go<00:04:30.909> over<00:04:31.300> them<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.720> creates<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.229> nice<00:04:32.710> bleeding

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
go over them and creates a nice bleeding

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.020 
go over them and creates a nice bleeding
puddling<00:04:34.060> effect<00:04:34.979> so<00:04:35.979> you<00:04:36.039> can<00:04:36.490> really<00:04:36.819> take

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
puddling effect so you can really take

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.020 
puddling effect so you can really take
advantage<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.750> I<00:04:38.259> can<00:04:38.879> purposefully<00:04:39.879> go

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
advantage of that I can purposefully go

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.860 
advantage of that I can purposefully go
into<00:04:40.360> these<00:04:40.509> areas<00:04:41.110> in<00:04:41.409> order<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:42.659> have<00:04:43.659> this

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
into these areas in order to have this

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.180 
into these areas in order to have this
more<00:04:44.199> creative<00:04:44.940> outline<00:04:46.349> and<00:04:47.349> also<00:04:47.770> add<00:04:47.949> some

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
more creative outline and also add some

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.399 
more creative outline and also add some
dark<00:04:48.719> shapes<00:04:49.719> into<00:04:50.139> it<00:04:51.599> a<00:04:52.599> big<00:04:52.990> part<00:04:53.229> of

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
dark shapes into it a big part of

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.439 
dark shapes into it a big part of
working<00:04:53.650> would<00:04:53.949> think<00:04:54.190> is<00:04:54.370> kind<00:04:54.639> of<00:04:54.789> reacting

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
working would think is kind of reacting

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.749 
working would think is kind of reacting
to<00:04:55.479> the<00:04:55.719> medium<00:04:56.229> and<00:04:56.440> being<00:04:56.710> spontaneous<00:04:57.550> with

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
to the medium and being spontaneous with

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:03.450 
to the medium and being spontaneous with
it<00:04:59.099> don't<00:05:00.099> be<00:05:00.250> afraid<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:02.050> create<00:05:02.469> accidents

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
it don't be afraid to create accidents

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.740 
it don't be afraid to create accidents
you<00:05:03.729> know<00:05:03.879> accidents<00:05:04.330> whoops<00:05:04.629> like<00:05:05.440> this<00:05:05.650> one

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
you know accidents whoops like this one

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.300 
you know accidents whoops like this one
accidents<00:05:07.750> are<00:05:07.870> not<00:05:07.900> always<00:05:08.289> a<00:05:08.440> bad<00:05:08.710> thing<00:05:08.770> so

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
accidents are not always a bad thing so

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.619 
accidents are not always a bad thing so
you<00:05:09.370> can<00:05:09.750> use<00:05:10.750> them<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.169> your<00:05:11.199> advantage<00:05:11.349> and

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:12.629 
you can use them to your advantage and

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:15.779 
you can use them to your advantage and
incorporate<00:05:13.629> them<00:05:13.870> into<00:05:14.110> your<00:05:14.409> drawing<00:05:14.949> so<00:05:15.610> if

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
incorporate them into your drawing so if

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.610 
incorporate them into your drawing so if
this<00:05:15.909> was<00:05:16.180> an<00:05:16.330> accident<00:05:16.810> you<00:05:17.050> know<00:05:17.349> and<00:05:17.530> I

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
this was an accident you know and I

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.580 
this was an accident you know and I
didn't<00:05:17.949> want<00:05:18.129> this<00:05:18.280> there<00:05:18.550> I<00:05:18.580> could<00:05:19.590> somehow

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
didn't want this there I could somehow

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.010 
didn't want this there I could somehow
integrate<00:05:21.460> it<00:05:21.669> into<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.120> piece<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.599> make<00:05:22.810> it

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
integrate it into the piece and make it

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.249 
integrate it into the piece and make it
an<00:05:23.430> intentional<00:05:24.430> part<00:05:24.669> of<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.120> artwork<00:05:25.360> now<00:05:26.229> I

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
an intentional part of the artwork now I

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.740 
an intentional part of the artwork now I
think<00:05:26.500> you<00:05:26.800> can<00:05:27.009> see<00:05:27.279> that<00:05:27.580> my<00:05:27.909> dry<00:05:28.270> layer<00:05:28.509> of

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
think you can see that my dry layer of

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.469 
think you can see that my dry layer of
watercolor<00:05:29.080> has<00:05:29.560> dried<00:05:29.919> so<00:05:30.550> I'm<00:05:30.819> gonna<00:05:31.060> go<00:05:31.240> in

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
watercolor has dried so I'm gonna go in

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.430 
watercolor has dried so I'm gonna go in
with<00:05:32.169> another<00:05:32.349> layer<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:34.210> trick<00:05:34.509> is<00:05:34.690> to<00:05:34.719> put

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
with another layer the trick is to put

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.830 
with another layer the trick is to put
it<00:05:35.590> over<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:36.130> areas<00:05:36.699> that<00:05:37.650> are<00:05:38.650> already<00:05:39.039> dry

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
it over the areas that are already dry

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.540 
it over the areas that are already dry
so<00:05:40.840> what<00:05:41.020> happens<00:05:41.469> is<00:05:41.650> that<00:05:41.680> you<00:05:41.949> create<00:05:42.159> this

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
so what happens is that you create this

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.700 
so what happens is that you create this
edge<00:05:44.490> and<00:05:45.490> that<00:05:45.550> edge<00:05:46.150> is<00:05:46.750> something<00:05:47.229> that<00:05:47.500> you

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
edge and that edge is something that you

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.339 
edge and that edge is something that you
can<00:05:47.979> blend<00:05:48.219> in

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:59.689 

or<00:05:52.979> leave<00:05:53.479> as<00:05:54.479> a<00:05:54.990> heartline<00:05:57.919> and<00:05:58.919> then<00:05:59.580> the

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
or leave as a heartline and then the

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.570 
or leave as a heartline and then the
next<00:06:00.059> step<00:06:00.300> would<00:06:00.509> be<00:06:00.569> to<00:06:01.110> allow<00:06:01.949> this<00:06:02.279> to<00:06:02.550> dry

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
next step would be to allow this to dry

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.779 
next step would be to allow this to dry
and<00:06:03.180> then<00:06:03.930> go<00:06:04.169> with<00:06:04.379> another<00:06:04.680> color<00:06:05.039> and<00:06:05.399> allow

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
and then go with another color and allow

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.239 
and then go with another color and allow
it<00:06:05.849> to<00:06:05.969> dry<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:06.629> go<00:06:06.839> over<00:06:07.349> with<00:06:07.559> another<00:06:07.919> color

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:08.249 
it to dry and go over with another color

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:11.119 
it to dry and go over with another color
and<00:06:08.539> basically<00:06:09.539> artists<00:06:10.199> can<00:06:10.349> have<00:06:10.589> hundreds

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 
and basically artists can have hundreds

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.279 
and basically artists can have hundreds
of<00:06:11.219> layers<00:06:11.490> in<00:06:11.909> their<00:06:12.149> watercolor<00:06:12.659> drawings

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
of layers in their watercolor drawings

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.260 
of layers in their watercolor drawings
and<00:06:13.499> that's<00:06:13.800> what<00:06:14.069> makes<00:06:14.550> their<00:06:14.819> drawing

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
and that's what makes their drawing

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.159 
and that's what makes their drawing
really<00:06:16.309> vibrant<00:06:17.309> and<00:06:17.819> have<00:06:18.539> a<00:06:18.569> lot<00:06:18.779> of<00:06:18.809> depth

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
really vibrant and have a lot of depth

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.159 
really vibrant and have a lot of depth
and<00:06:19.819> these<00:06:20.819> areas<00:06:21.270> don't<00:06:21.419> necessarily<00:06:22.050> have

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
and these areas don't necessarily have

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.959 
and these areas don't necessarily have
to<00:06:22.319> be<00:06:22.439> big<00:06:22.680> they<00:06:22.889> can<00:06:23.069> be<00:06:23.219> on<00:06:23.490> much<00:06:23.789> smaller

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:23.969 
to be big they can be on much smaller

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.389 
to be big they can be on much smaller
scale<00:06:24.599> such<00:06:24.899> as<00:06:25.020> individual<00:06:25.770> shapes<00:06:26.129> or

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:26.399 
scale such as individual shapes or

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:29.480 
scale such as individual shapes or
stones<00:06:26.779> that<00:06:27.779> you're<00:06:28.409> layering<00:06:29.009> over<00:06:29.369> and

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
stones that you're layering over and

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.519 
stones that you're layering over and
over<00:06:29.759> again<00:06:29.879> the<00:06:30.270> idea<00:06:30.659> is<00:06:30.869> to<00:06:31.139> build<00:06:31.289> up<00:06:31.469> your

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529 
over again the idea is to build up your

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:33.290 
over again the idea is to build up your
colors<00:06:32.099> and<00:06:32.369> not<00:06:32.520> to<00:06:32.669> get<00:06:32.819> too<00:06:32.969> dark<00:06:33.149> right

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
colors and not to get too dark right

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.260 
colors and not to get too dark right
away<00:06:33.749> so<00:06:33.809> if<00:06:34.080> you<00:06:34.199> start<00:06:34.499> out<00:06:34.649> with<00:06:34.709> a<00:06:35.639> lighter

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
away so if you start out with a lighter

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.589 
away so if you start out with a lighter
are<00:06:36.539> the<00:06:36.749> undertone<00:06:37.409> such<00:06:37.680> as<00:06:37.830> yellow<00:06:38.449> you<00:06:39.449> can

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
are the undertone such as yellow you can

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:42.529 
are the undertone such as yellow you can
keep<00:06:39.839> adding<00:06:40.139> other<00:06:40.740> colors<00:06:41.339> such<00:06:41.520> as<00:06:41.729> red<00:06:42.509> or

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
keep adding other colors such as red or

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:46.070 
keep adding other colors such as red or
blue<00:06:43.050> or<00:06:43.080> brown<00:06:43.649> and<00:06:44.059> that<00:06:45.059> gradually<00:06:45.869> build

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
blue or brown and that gradually build

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.610 
blue or brown and that gradually build
them<00:06:46.259> up<00:06:46.379> to<00:06:46.439> the<00:06:46.770> image<00:06:47.189> that<00:06:47.430> you<00:06:47.580> like
