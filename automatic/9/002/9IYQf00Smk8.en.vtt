00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
the film but I think the Edit that we

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.680 
the film but I think the Edit that we
have<00:03:01.320> now<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.890> made<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.610> most<00:03:02.760> sense<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:03.600> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
have now it made the most sense for the

have now it made the most sense for the
film<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:04.050> mean<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:05.360> think<00:03:06.360> we<00:03:06.570> had<00:03:06.690> some<00:03:06.840> really

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
it would jump too far left for for the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.610 
it would jump too far left for for the
audience<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:12.330> um<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.750> was<00:03:12.870> some<00:03:13.019> really<00:03:13.380> great
