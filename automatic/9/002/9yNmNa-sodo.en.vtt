this the washer way worked quite well
but<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:35.489> I'm<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.820> use<00:00:36.000> and

what's<00:00:39.230> actually<00:00:40.230> my<00:00:40.710> mom<00:00:40.890> said<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> heat<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
what's actually my mom said to heat it

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.110 
what's actually my mom said to heat it
up<00:00:41.850> first<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.690> let's<00:00:42.930> try<00:00:43.230> doing<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:44.090> so<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
up first so let's try doing that so I

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.779 
up first so let's try doing that so I
will<00:00:45.559> just<00:00:46.559> turn<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> variac<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.640> little

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
will just turn the variac up a little

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.670 
will just turn the variac up a little
bit<00:00:47.969> until<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.570> don't<00:00:48.960> know<00:00:49.020> how<00:00:49.170> accurate<00:00:49.649> that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
bit until I don't know how accurate that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.020 
bit until I don't know how accurate that
temperature<00:00:50.160> probe<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.550> actually<00:00:50.850> gonna<00:00:50.940> be

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
temperature probe is actually gonna be

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.069 
temperature probe is actually gonna be
but<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:52.399> guess<00:00:53.399> until<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> oil<00:00:54.570> start<00:00:54.809> sizzling

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
but I guess until the oil start sizzling

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.910 
but I guess until the oil start sizzling
a<00:00:55.379> little<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.680> maybe<00:00:56.270> I'll<00:00:57.270> turn<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.920> 10

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
a little bit maybe I'll turn it up 10

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.800 
a little bit maybe I'll turn it up 10
amps<00:01:02.359> I<00:01:04.460> put<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.610> olive<00:01:06.150> oil<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.600> there

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
amps I put a little olive oil in there

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.600 
amps I put a little olive oil in there
