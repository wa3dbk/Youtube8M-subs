another processor you could use this and
then<00:01:34.140> what's<00:01:34.770> great<00:01:34.920> about<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.400> would

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
then what's great about is that would

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.490 
then what's great about is that would

XP as a matter of fact with one gig you
have<00:02:04.439> more<00:02:04.680> than<00:02:04.770> enough<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:05.280> XP<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.820> XP<00:02:06.780> when

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
have more than enough for XP and XP when

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
the ability to throw on a video card in

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.820 
the ability to throw on a video card in
there<00:02:16.970> if<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.540> desire<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.470> PCI

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
there if you so desire this is a PCI

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.000 
there if you so desire this is a PCI
Express<00:02:19.129> x16<00:02:19.750> video<00:02:20.750> card<00:02:20.989> slot<00:02:21.379> that's<00:02:21.709> right

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
Express x16 video card slot that's right

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.070 
Express x16 video card slot that's right
there<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.430> also<00:02:22.640> have<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:22.910> PCI<00:02:23.239> Express<00:02:23.480> x1

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
there you also have a PCI Express x1

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.770 
there you also have a PCI Express x1
slot<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:24.860> can<00:02:24.890> add<00:02:25.129> their<00:02:25.400> sound<00:02:25.910> cards<00:02:26.360> fiber

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
slot you can add their sound cards fiber

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.390 
slot you can add their sound cards fiber
cards<00:02:27.170> any<00:02:27.319> extra<00:02:27.680> peripherals<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.099> you<00:02:28.190> may

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
cards any extra peripherals that you may

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.460 
cards any extra peripherals that you may
have<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:28.910> then<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.420> also<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.930> two<00:02:30.110> PCI

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
have and then you also have two PCI

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.589 
have and then you also have two PCI
slots<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.430> pretty<00:02:32.060> much<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.300> could<00:02:32.390> put<00:02:32.569> a

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
slots so pretty much you could put a

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.020 
slots so pretty much you could put a
wireless<00:02:33.200> card<00:02:33.410> or<00:02:33.800> whatever<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.700> want<00:02:34.880> you

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
wireless card or whatever you want you

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.670 
wireless card or whatever you want you
have<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.180> lot<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.480> connectivity<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.349> add<00:02:36.440> stuff

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
have a lot of connectivity to add stuff

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.380 
have a lot of connectivity to add stuff
on<00:02:36.860> there<00:02:37.099> it's<00:02:37.580> not<00:02:37.760> going<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.000> be<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> problem

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
on there it's not going to be a problem

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.080 
on there it's not going to be a problem
and<00:02:38.769> let's<00:02:39.769> go<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.129> side<00:02:40.340> here<00:02:40.610> let<00:02:40.849> me<00:02:40.910> go

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
and let's go to the side here let me go

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.120 
and let's go to the side here let me go
starting<00:02:41.599> up<00:02:41.720> here<00:02:41.840> from<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.080> top<00:02:42.319> those<00:02:43.010> are

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
starting up here from the top those are

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.650 
starting up here from the top those are
your<00:02:43.220> ps2<00:02:43.459> for<00:02:44.150> your<00:02:44.269> mouse<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.569> your

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
your ps2 for your mouse and your

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.660 
your ps2 for your mouse and your
keyboard<00:02:44.950> what<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:45.980> think<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.400> nice<00:02:46.519> about

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
keyboard what I think it's nice about

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.740 
keyboard what I think it's nice about
this<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:46.970> do<00:02:47.090> get<00:02:47.209> serial<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:47.690> parallel

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
this is you do get serial and parallel

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.170 
this is you do get serial and parallel
so<00:02:48.680> again<00:02:48.950> it's<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.220> budget<00:02:49.400> system<00:02:49.730> for

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
so again it's a budget system for

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.550 
so again it's a budget system for
someone<00:02:50.420> who<00:02:50.540> might<00:02:50.690> have<00:02:50.840> older<00:02:51.230> parts<00:02:51.500> you

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
someone who might have older parts you

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.170 
someone who might have older parts you
have<00:02:51.650> an<00:02:51.709> older<00:02:52.040> printer<00:02:52.400> at<00:02:52.519> home<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:52.910> you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
have an older printer at home and you

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.280 
have an older printer at home and you
don't<00:02:53.299> want<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.540> upgrade<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.049> don't<00:02:54.170> want

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
don't want to upgrade it you don't want

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.110 
don't want to upgrade it you don't want
to<00:02:54.349> waste<00:02:54.500> money<00:02:54.680> right<00:02:55.640> here<00:02:55.819> you<00:02:55.970> just

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
to waste money right here you just

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.280 
to waste money right here you just
connect<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.450> up<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.660> you're<00:02:56.750> good<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.989> go

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
connect it up and you're good to go

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
them there we go four SATA headers or

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.670 
them there we go four SATA headers or
SATA<00:04:23.600> however<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:23.960> want<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.110> pronounce<00:04:24.230> it<00:04:24.530> so

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
SATA however you want to pronounce it so

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.660 
SATA however you want to pronounce it so
you<00:04:24.740> can't<00:04:24.950> put<00:04:25.070> up<00:04:25.160> to<00:04:25.250> four<00:04:25.430> hard<00:04:25.610> drives

right off the bat but let's say you do
have<00:04:37.880> these<00:04:38.090> older<00:04:38.450> IDE<00:04:38.750> hard<00:04:38.810> drives<00:04:39.230> and<00:04:39.350> you

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
have these older IDE hard drives and you

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.140 
have these older IDE hard drives and you
maybe<00:04:39.530> bought<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.160> bigger<00:04:40.490> one<00:04:40.610> from<00:04:41.000> your

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
maybe bought a bigger one from your

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.270 
maybe bought a bigger one from your
older<00:04:41.480> system<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.080> you<00:04:42.170> upgraded<00:04:42.590> you<00:04:43.160> can

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
older system that you upgraded you can

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.560 
older system that you upgraded you can
still<00:04:43.460> load<00:04:43.790> that<00:04:43.970> on<00:04:44.090> here<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.330> it's<00:04:44.450> not

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
still load that on here and it's not

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.700 
still load that on here and it's not
going<00:04:44.660> to<00:04:44.750> be<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.840> big<00:04:45.080> deal<00:04:45.260> if<00:04:45.470> you're<00:04:45.560> just

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
going to be a big deal if you're just

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.680 
going to be a big deal if you're just
gonna<00:04:45.830> put<00:04:46.040> pictures<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:46.700> music<00:04:46.790> on<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.330> you

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
gonna put pictures and music on it you

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.240 
gonna put pictures and music on it you
don't<00:04:47.870> need<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> performance<00:04:48.530> of<00:04:48.650> SATA<00:04:48.890> but

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
don't need the performance of SATA but

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.290 
don't need the performance of SATA but
your<00:04:49.340> operating<00:04:49.730> system<00:04:49.940> you<00:04:50.030> want<00:04:50.090> it<00:04:50.210> to

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
your operating system you want it to

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.210 
your operating system you want it to
boot<00:04:50.450> up<00:04:50.570> quickly<00:04:50.780> so<00:04:50.900> SATA<00:04:51.230> is<00:04:51.350> great<00:04:51.650> so

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
boot up quickly so SATA is great so

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.770 
boot up quickly so SATA is great so
