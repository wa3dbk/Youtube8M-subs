so<00:03:00.470> good<00:03:00.739> job<00:03:00.980> there<00:03:01.220> while<00:03:01.880> we're<00:03:02.060> in<00:03:02.150> this

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
so good job there while we're in this

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.590 
so good job there while we're in this
close-up<00:03:02.690> view<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.800> can<00:03:04.070> see<00:03:04.209> very<00:03:05.209> very

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
close-up view you can see very very

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.350 
close-up view you can see very very
little<00:03:05.810> rough<00:03:06.110> edges<00:03:06.350> just<00:03:06.770> around<00:03:07.610> here<00:03:07.940> that

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
little rough edges just around here that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.150 
little rough edges just around here that
doesn't<00:03:08.660> really<00:03:08.840> detract<00:03:09.410> from<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.650> quality

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
doesn't really detract from the quality

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.350 
doesn't really detract from the quality
of<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.310> case<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:10.730> think<00:03:10.910> it's<00:03:11.030> more<00:03:11.060> than

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
of the case I think it's more than

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.080 
of the case I think it's more than
acceptable<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.310> then<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:13.580> side<00:03:13.640> here

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
acceptable and then on this side here

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.390 
acceptable and then on this side here
it's<00:03:14.420> obviously<00:03:14.780> completely<00:03:15.020> blank<00:03:15.620> they<00:03:16.340> are

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
it's obviously completely blank they are

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.890 
it's obviously completely blank they are
on<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.610> back<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.120> where<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.450> case<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:17.630> a

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
on the back this is where the case is a

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.479 
on the back this is where the case is a
little<00:03:18.080> bit<00:03:18.170> different<00:03:18.560> we've<00:03:18.860> also<00:03:19.010> got<00:03:19.280> cut

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
little bit different we've also got cut

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.930 
little bit different we've also got cut
out<00:03:19.520> for<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:19.940> camera<00:03:20.330> we've<00:03:21.080> also<00:03:21.260> got<00:03:21.530> this

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
out for the camera we've also got this

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.380 
out for the camera we've also got this
here<00:03:22.940> it's<00:03:23.780> like<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:23.959> handle<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.760> it's<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:25.970> got

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
here it's like a handle and it's so got

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.380 
here it's like a handle and it's so got
many<00:03:27.260> purposes<00:03:27.650> actually<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.640> first<00:03:28.820> purpose

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
many purposes actually the first purpose

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.900 
many purposes actually the first purpose
and<00:03:29.660> drift<00:03:30.380> correct<00:03:30.799> me<00:03:30.920> if<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:31.130> do<00:03:31.730> this

and drift correct me if I to do this

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.020 
and drift correct me if I to do this
wrong<00:03:32.209> but<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.500> sort<00:03:33.709> of<00:03:33.799> hold<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.820> device

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
wrong but is to sort of hold the device

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.990 
wrong but is to sort of hold the device
in<00:03:35.989> different<00:03:36.410> ways<00:03:36.560> let<00:03:37.370> me<00:03:37.459> just<00:03:37.640> pop<00:03:37.790> this

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
in different ways let me just pop this

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.050 
in different ways let me just pop this
down<00:03:38.269> and<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:39.170> shows<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:40.730> actual

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
down and that shows you the actual

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.600 
down and that shows you the actual
second<00:03:42.019> purpose<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.620> which<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.489> to

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
second purpose of this which is to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.199 
second purpose of this which is to
actually<00:03:43.760> use<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.180> as<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:45.500> stand<00:03:46.310> so<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.060> can

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
actually use it as a stand so you can

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.729 
actually use it as a stand so you can
use<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.570> in<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:48.140> mode<00:03:48.470> for<00:03:50.049> sort<00:03:51.049> of<00:03:51.170> photo

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739

use it in this mode for sort of photo
viewing<00:03:52.220> video<00:03:52.760> viewing<00:03:53.150> or<00:03:53.420> if<00:03:54.110> you've

perhaps got some portrait photos you

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.500 
perhaps got some portrait photos you
could<00:03:56.870> even<00:03:56.989> put<00:03:57.950> it<00:03:58.040> round<00:03:58.250> into<00:03:59.060> this<00:03:59.209> mode

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
could even put it round into this mode

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.280 
could even put it round into this mode
here<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.049> have<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.860> standing<00:04:01.610> upright<00:04:02.600> so<00:04:03.170> you

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
here and have it standing upright so you

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.130 
here and have it standing upright so you
can<00:04:03.500> stand<00:04:03.860> in<00:04:04.160> an<00:04:04.489> upright<00:04:04.910> mode<00:04:05.209> as<00:04:05.420> well<00:04:05.450> how

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
can stand in an upright mode as well how

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.590 
can stand in an upright mode as well how
cool<00:04:06.410> is<00:04:06.620> that<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:07.760> know<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.180> does<00:04:08.420> also

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
cool is that you know it does also

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.789 
cool is that you know it does also

mention on the packaging that you can in
fact<00:04:13.450> put<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.570> all<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.900> way<00:04:14.930> around<00:04:15.110> here<00:04:15.709> and

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
fact put it all the way around here and

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.580 
fact put it all the way around here and
hold<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.549> like<00:04:16.669> this<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:17.120> this<00:04:18.049> sort<00:04:18.350> gives

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
hold it like this and this sort gives

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.000 
hold it like this and this sort gives
you<00:04:18.739> just<00:04:18.979> an<00:04:19.160> extra<00:04:19.579> bit<00:04:20.180> of<00:04:20.209> support<00:04:20.540> on<00:04:21.169> the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
you just an extra bit of support on the

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.130 
you just an extra bit of support on the
side<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.700> stand<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:23.810> you've<00:04:24.110> got

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
side of the stand so that you've got

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.830 
side of the stand so that you've got
saying<00:04:24.950> firms<00:04:25.250> grip<00:04:25.520> onto<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:26.390> you<00:04:26.570> can<00:04:26.690> also

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
saying firms grip onto and you can also

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.500 
saying firms grip onto and you can also
do<00:04:27.140> it<00:04:27.260> obviously<00:04:27.890> in<00:04:28.160> this<00:04:28.550> rotation<00:04:29.240> as<00:04:29.360> well

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
do it obviously in this rotation as well

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.420 
do it obviously in this rotation as well
with<00:04:29.660> your<00:04:29.810> left<00:04:30.020> or<00:04:30.200> right<00:04:30.380> handed<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.950> it's

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
with your left or right handed and it's

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.800 
with your left or right handed and it's
just<00:04:31.610> something<00:04:31.880> just<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.300> give<00:04:32.450> that<00:04:32.660> extra

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
just something just to give that extra

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.610 
just something just to give that extra
bit<00:04:33.349> of<00:04:33.410> support<00:04:33.620> here

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
bit of support here

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.960 
bit of support here
if<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:34.949> need<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.520> counterbalances

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
if you need it and it counterbalances

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.230 
if you need it and it counterbalances
the<00:04:36.600> weight<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.650> ipad<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.280> bit<00:04:38.580> more<00:04:38.790> I'm

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
the weight of the ipad a bit more I'm

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.670 
the weight of the ipad a bit more I'm
unsure<00:04:39.600> that<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:40.110> would<00:04:40.290> ever<00:04:40.410> use<00:04:40.530> that

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
unsure that I would ever use that

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.340 
unsure that I would ever use that
feature<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.550> think<00:04:42.449> I<00:04:42.660> would<00:04:42.870> probably<00:04:43.020> find

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
feature I think I would probably find

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.920 
feature I think I would probably find
myself<00:04:43.650> more<00:04:44.220> using<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.699> standard<00:04:45.540> feature

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
myself more using the standard feature

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.260 
myself more using the standard feature
of<00:04:46.169> it<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.470> think<00:04:46.740> that's<00:04:46.889> very<00:04:46.949> nice<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.970> when

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
of it I think that's very nice and when

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.230 
of it I think that's very nice and when
it's<00:04:48.389> not<00:04:48.540> in<00:04:48.600> use<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:49.860> very<00:04:50.100> quickly<00:04:50.520> just

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
it's not in use it very quickly just

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.570 
it's not in use it very quickly just
folds<00:04:51.600> back<00:04:51.750> down<00:04:51.990> it<00:04:52.410> doesn't<00:04:52.770> rotate<00:04:52.919> at<00:04:53.400> all

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
folds back down it doesn't rotate at all

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.879 
folds back down it doesn't rotate at all
so<00:04:53.790> there's<00:04:53.910> no<00:04:54.030> rotation<00:04:54.630> on<00:04:54.750> this<00:04:54.900> axis<00:04:55.139> it

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
so there's no rotation on this axis it

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.189 
so there's no rotation on this axis it
purely<00:04:56.250> is<00:04:56.460> just<00:04:56.699> a<00:04:56.820> slap<00:04:57.030> out<00:04:57.240> stand<00:04:57.600> and<00:04:58.080> I

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
purely is just a slap out stand and I

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.870 
purely is just a slap out stand and I
think<00:04:58.440> that's<00:04:58.560> really<00:04:58.860> good<00:04:59.070> because<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.850> can

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
think that's really good because you can

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.780 
think that's really good because you can
use<00:05:00.389> it<00:05:00.600> for<00:05:01.110> giving<00:05:01.620> a<00:05:01.710> nice<00:05:01.889> angle<00:05:02.220> nice

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
use it for giving a nice angle nice

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.120 
use it for giving a nice angle nice
viewing<00:05:03.240> angle<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.690> your<00:05:03.750> iPad<00:05:04.169> to<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.919> amount

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
viewing angle to your iPad to the amount

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.370 
viewing angle to your iPad to the amount
of<00:05:05.220> protection<00:05:05.370> it<00:05:05.790> offers<00:05:06.030> up<00:05:06.180> is<00:05:06.360> good<00:05:07.080> too

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
of protection it offers up is good too

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.430 
of protection it offers up is good too

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
little bit of a different design as I

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.710 
little bit of a different design as I
say<00:05:13.860> not<00:05:14.310> so<00:05:14.550> sure<00:05:14.729> on<00:05:14.910> whether<00:05:15.330> i'm<00:05:15.479> going<00:05:15.539> to

say not so sure on whether i'm going to

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.300 
say not so sure on whether i'm going to
use<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.139> hold<00:05:16.289> the<00:05:16.500> device<00:05:16.620> but<00:05:17.039> certainly

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
use it to hold the device but certainly

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.580 
use it to hold the device but certainly
for<00:05:17.460> standing<00:05:17.880> up<00:05:18.060> I<00:05:18.360> can<00:05:18.870> see<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.110> being<00:05:19.260> very

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
for standing up I can see it being very

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.950 
for standing up I can see it being very
useful<00:05:20.070> indeed<00:05:20.300> well<00:05:21.300> thanks<00:05:21.510> very<00:05:21.539> much<00:05:21.720> for
