00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.699
 hello nice welcome safety 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:12.169
 doctor on this occasion we bring you the 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:14.449
 tutorial of this makeup that can 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.100
 see here is in coffee tones is that this is 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.769
 inspired by an image that he sent me 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.539
 mariana padilla de thalÃ­a and she asked me 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.279
 for his birthday so he sent him 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.029
 congratulations to her whose birthday 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.220
 December 30th it seems to me and then if he 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.509
 I made it special for her because I 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.189
 asked right now I'm doing like that 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.449
 all requests have been me 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.129
 left and lips and they were roses but I 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.199
 this time I wanted to put them red or 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.359
 whether I recorded on the lips but 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.760
 then less change red and also to 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.109
 end of the video I leave an outfit that 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.699
 I recorded that also good has been 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.379
 very much and that I have always told you that 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.090
 no but now I decided to do it to see 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.699
 how do you think then if you want 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.769
 I see how this will make the 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.899
 upload the photo to facebook so they can see 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.730
 the inspiration of thalÃ­a makeup 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.989
 that has pink lips but then 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.269
 as I tell them in the end it is already 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.100
 change red and also if they want to see my 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.500
 outfit as combine stem here 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.840
 with my clothes and keep watching the video 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.520
 we see in the next bye let's start 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.770
 with a first and this we will apply 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.450
 where are we going to apply shadows I 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.720
 I'm going to seal with a little bit of dust 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.720
 loose 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.270
 once I have that, I will use 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.100
 my umbrella for transition and we're going 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.100
 to put in the basin well diffused 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.390
 and 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.100
 I want to know a little bit the account 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.080
 using a dark coffee and this I'm going 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.540
 to put right in the basin I'm going to do 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.150
 like a line like scott gray but what 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.070
 I'm going to determine so let's put it together 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.070
 a little bit also with the external ub 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.130
 to blur that brown line and not 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.680
 it looks very rough we are going to blur the 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.630
 with a coffee a little more clarito this 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.100
 I'm applying it with the same broach 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.410
 to blur what I used for the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.360
 transition shadow and we're going to apply it 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.370
 just above the dark brown shadow 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.770
 what we did to mark our account 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.170
 It is important that you take this step 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.510
 that blur that line well well 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.300
 Now I will use umbrella 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.970
 color as recite with glitter below you 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.920
 I leave the list of products and this I'm going 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.720
 to apply in the corners of my eye in 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.890
 the inner and outer corner and the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.890
 I'm going to join in between 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.690
 remember that it is important to blur 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.060
 it's good that all those shadows come together 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.490
 in this case I felt that the shadow was 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.770
 very clear and I put on top of that color 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.770
 pink one a little bit darker 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.480
 it is important that we leave the center of 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.310
 clean eye because there we are going to apply a 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.980
 pigment grade then we grab a 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.990
 pigment or a golden shadow that you 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.240
 have and we put it right in the center 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.620
 because in the picture of thalÃ­a it looks good 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.620
 illuminated with gold from that area 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.280
 now it was a clear shadow we are going to 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.230
 illuminate the arch of the eyebrow this same 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.769
 we will use it to illuminate 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.769
 the lacrimal 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.760
 Now I'm going to do a little more to 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.310
 same dark brown shadow that we had 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.440
 used we are going to apply it in the basin 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.300
 and also in the external ub only 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.770
 to darken a little more the 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.840
 outlined that has tone in this 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.400
 occasion does not have a connotation of 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.320
 outside so we're just going to go to 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.720
 delineate straight our entire line of 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.240
 eyelashes once I have my 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.500
 eyelashes and my bass and everything post I'm going to 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.030
 continue with the bottom part I'm going to 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.700
 re-use the dark brown shadow 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.670
 and I'm going to delineate the lash line and 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.470
 just as you blur the brown line in the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.910
 eyelid mobile we will do it in the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.220
 bottom part with the same umbrella 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.209
 We're going to help you blur that 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.209
 dark coffee line 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.710
 and 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.120
 and we also eliminate the tear 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.129
 we put a little mask of 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.900
 eyelashes actually the makeup that 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.879
 used the talia on this occasion is 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.310
 super easy only is to play with 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:36.919
 several coffee tones now as I already have 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.389
 my contours all and all done we are going to 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.219
 Apply a little bit of blush on 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.819
 cheeks and we're also going to use a 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.819
 illuminator 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.139
 I'm going to outline my lips with a pencil 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.389
 little pink the lipstick that has them is 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.090
 a rose like a dark red then 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.009
 I combine honorable as well as barbie with 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.900
 a darker rose to get more or 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.550
 less to the tone you already have and 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.780
 it also has like a gloss gradient 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.780
 over so I put gloss 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.400
 as I had told you on this occasion 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.430
 To combine my outfit I changed the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.410
 lipstick for a red lipstick so for 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.950
 I 'm using a lip now 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.950
 different 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.740
 That would be the makeup I hope 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.740
 like it very much and started with the car 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.020
 and 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.960
 and 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:29.610
 and 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.000
 and that was how I would look 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.730
 nothing else I changed my lips to red 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.930
 because I felt that I was going more with my dose and 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.360
 Well yes I hope you liked it 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.970

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.500
 all those who asked me outfit the 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.420
 I do not know if I really like doing 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.030
 this because I do not feel like that very 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.700
 comfortable to show me show my body 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.170
 completely, but I do not know about you
