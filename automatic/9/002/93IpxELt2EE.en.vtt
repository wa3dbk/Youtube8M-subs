will exclude them from the import so I'm

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.850

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.830 
copies that were included in those three
folders<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.730> now<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.090> I've<00:03:54.180> got<00:03:54.330> one<00:03:54.480> copy<00:03:54.720> of

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
folders so now that I've got one copy of

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.990 
folders so now that I've got one copy of
each<00:03:55.170> image<00:03:55.410> imported<00:03:56.190> with<00:03:56.370> no<00:03:56.519> duplicates

each image imported with no duplicates

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.850 
each image imported with no duplicates
it's<00:03:57.269> time<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.630> move<00:03:57.840> those<00:03:58.019> images<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.680> their

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
it's time to move those images to their

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.130 
it's time to move those images to their
own<00:03:58.980> folder<00:03:59.250> so<00:04:00.209> what<00:04:00.390> I'm<00:04:00.480> going<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.660> do<00:04:00.870> is

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
expected because Lightroom moved them

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.400 
expected because Lightroom moved them
all<00:04:55.650> in<00:04:55.800> there<00:04:55.980> and<00:04:56.160> what's<00:04:56.850> left<00:04:57.210> in<00:04:57.630> my

original stock image folders are the

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.220 
original stock image folders are the
images<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.680> were<00:05:02.310> duplicates<00:05:02.790> so<00:05:03.200> what<00:05:04.200> I

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
images that were duplicates so what I

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.260 
images that were duplicates so what I
wind<00:05:04.500> up<00:05:04.650> with<00:05:04.860> is<00:05:05.190> in<00:05:05.430> this<00:05:05.580> deduplicated

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
wind up with is in this deduplicated

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.440 
wind up with is in this deduplicated
folder<00:05:06.570> is<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:07.380> one<00:05:08.010> copy<00:05:08.250> of<00:05:08.400> each<00:05:08.850> image<00:05:09.090> no
