a<00:02:21.680> belt<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.769> runs<00:02:22.890> all<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.340> way<00:02:23.459> down<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.060> it

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
a belt that runs all the way down and it

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.690 
a belt that runs all the way down and it
I<00:02:25.019> can<00:02:25.530> feel<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.129> putting<00:02:26.400> my<00:02:26.459> hand

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
I can feel it now just putting my hand

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.420 
I can feel it now just putting my hand
in<00:02:26.819> there<00:02:26.999> so<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:27.870> when<00:02:28.469> you<00:02:28.650> put<00:02:28.980> your<00:02:29.010> iPad

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
in there so that when you put your iPad

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.649 
in there so that when you put your iPad
in<00:02:29.989> like<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.319> it's<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.829> nice<00:02:32.010> snug<00:02:32.999> fit<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:35.659> has

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
in like so it's a nice snug fit and has

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.179 
in like so it's a nice snug fit and has
a<00:02:36.689> nice<00:02:36.870> bit<00:02:37.079> of<00:02:37.109> protection<00:02:37.290> around<00:02:37.950> all

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
a nice bit of protection around all

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.369 
a nice bit of protection around all
edges<00:02:38.340> fits<00:02:38.790> perfectly<00:02:39.329> like<00:02:39.750> all<00:02:39.989> Griffin

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
edges fits perfectly like all Griffin

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.280 
edges fits perfectly like all Griffin
cases<00:02:40.739> may<00:02:40.920> very<00:02:41.189> well<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.959> when<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.049> want<00:02:43.200> to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
cases may very well and when you want to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.849 
cases may very well and when you want to
get<00:02:43.409> it<00:02:43.530> out<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:44.400> pull<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:45.030> there<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.859> it

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
get it out you pull on there and it

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.319 
get it out you pull on there and it
emerges<00:02:47.189> out<00:02:48.200> just<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.439> just<00:02:49.980> enough<00:02:50.299> so<00:02:51.299> that

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
emerges out just so just enough so that

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.489 
emerges out just so just enough so that
you<00:02:51.510> can<00:02:51.629> pull<00:02:51.749> it<00:02:51.840> out<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.079> that<00:02:52.169> arming<00:02:52.379> to

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:52.499 
you can pull it out with that arming to

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.920 
you can pull it out with that arming to
solve<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.889> open<00:02:53.730> up<00:02:53.909> quite<00:02:54.329> fiddly<00:02:54.569> getting

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
solve I open up quite fiddly getting

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.869 
solve I open up quite fiddly getting
your<00:02:55.019> hands<00:02:55.169> in<00:02:55.349> none<00:02:55.829> of<00:02:55.859> that<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.700> pull<00:02:56.849> on

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
your hands in none of that just pull on

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.599 
your hands in none of that just pull on
the<00:02:57.090> tab<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.409> pops<00:02:58.620> out<00:02:58.799> a<00:02:59.040> bit<00:02:59.459> like<00:02:59.579> a

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
the tab and it pops out a bit like a

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.039 
the tab and it pops out a bit like a
piece<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.819> toast<00:03:00.919> so<00:03:01.919> putting<00:03:02.549> it<00:03:02.699> in<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.900> can

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
piece of toast so putting it in you can

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.369 
piece of toast so putting it in you can
see<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.469> it<00:03:04.590> does<00:03:04.829> actually<00:03:04.949> cover<00:03:05.459> up<00:03:05.669> the

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
see that it does actually cover up the

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.530 
see that it does actually cover up the
dock<00:03:07.379> connector<00:03:07.919> and<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.129> speakers<00:03:08.939> at<00:03:09.449> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
dock connector and the speakers at the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.750 
dock connector and the speakers at the
bottom<00:03:09.810> although<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.739> top<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.310> do<00:03:11.519> still<00:03:11.579> have

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
bottom although on top you do still have

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.709 
bottom although on top you do still have
available<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:13.250> headphone<00:03:14.250> jack<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.000> if<00:03:15.659> you

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:15.719
