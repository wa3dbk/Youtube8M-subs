 game awards and many other awards 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.510
 it is also interesting that in the province of the garden

 joint porn star voiced 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.740

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.190
 thousand lines of dialogue 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.119
 which is four times more than 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.379
 disinfection 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.589

 she was silent 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.349
 but I still have 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.399
 the finalized game was equal 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.399
 and keep the difference to 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.309
 the whole atmosphere of the eighties and and 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.319
 numerous cinema 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.789
 actually perpetuated the voice network in 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.629
 in the eyes of our editorial board 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.019
 along with the fourth part this is one of 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.529
 most loved us trouble 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.729
 Of course, not only scenes atmosphere 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.189
 made vice city so special 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.409
 the authors have brought a large number 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.899
 significant gameplay changes 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:56.439
 so for example in the game appeared 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.320
 opportunity to buy real estate 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.300
 which could then be used in 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.389
 as save points 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.539
 there is more mission inside the building 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:07.139
 the physical model is also complicated 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.019
 finally the opportunity 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.849
 shoot through tires and windshield 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:12.620
 number of cars 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.920
 increased to eight and ten 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.319
 and from new vehicles to the game 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.489
 motorcycles and helicopters were included 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.569
 normal aircraft were made and 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.639
 boats 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.929
 heroes even learned to squat 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:26.109
 added a few 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.099
 civil ministry agriculture this 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.959
 leftover food and ice cream distribution 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.029
 the physical model is now taken into account 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:33.819
 grip 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.379
 car and motorcycle behavior 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.229
 noted on the sand aha zone on wet and 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.719
 dry asphalt number of species 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.359
 weapons also increased to 40 a 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.469
 for the first time it was possible to dress the main character 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:48.509
 in different clothes 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.919
 thanks to improved graphics and selected 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.559
 visual style the city of vice played 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:56.529
 in much brighter colors than liberty 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:57.419
 city 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.009
 lighting effects were realized where 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:01.319
 higher level 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.729
 cars were kovalya to sleep and but ran 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.459
 sun lanes and sunsets could 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.589
 just to admire 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:11.680
 rockstar have taken another significant step on 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:12.329
 ways to improve 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.109
 city ​​life simulations 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.689
 and the picture never played on 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:20.689
 the atmosphere 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.550
 beta fighters the rock star again could not resist 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.520
 from jokes on competitors 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.650
 for example mission autosite 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.720
 the player must kill people whose names 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.210
 strongly resembles the main characters 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.449
 driver 2 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.819
 Yes, and somewhere and click through the edge of the archer stood 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.150
 l then rivals TV series 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.020
 On the market 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.090
 in response to this reflection with 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.030
 in one of the missions driver 3 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.280
 included a person with a lifeline 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.510
 named tony bern making after beta 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.590
 the main characters before the release of San Andreas 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.560
 could not alone 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.309
 to swim 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:59.619
 but probably the funniest joke was waiting 

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:02.249
 players after a full 100 percent 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:03.699
 passing game 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.210
 here he wore his wardrobe t-shirt with 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.060
 inscription 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.250
 I went through the whole beta vayu network and all that I 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.250
 got this fucking football 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.960
 of course could not do without 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.449
 scandals and history log those in real 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.229
 the world 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:23.999
 Vitya Russian community considered 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:26.389
 used matured haitians images 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:27.589
 offensive 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:29.089
 protested 

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:31.180
 and gave the people to the elder 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.479
 besides the community was extremely struck 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.630
 formulation task during one of 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.430
 missions which read the killers of all 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.439
 now 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.610
 of the innovations most protest 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.610
 caused the opportunity to visit the strip bar 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.159
 Overall, the annual city was particularly important. 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.999
 geta 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.899
 it is on it that the start lesson is finally 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.589
 formed a clear style 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:11.020
 concept and vector of development 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.710
 also authors demonstrated 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.120
 having good taste is great 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.400
 sense of humor and talent to create 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.139
 interesting characters 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:21.139
 well, and among other things it is 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.030
 still the only vitas 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.500
 bright colors 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.240
 and airy atmosphere judge bloody 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.960
 disassembly 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.270
 adjacent to pink suits and 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.360
 colorful sunsets 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.629
 weiss city was so good that 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:36.099
 it was hard to imagine why 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.099
 rockstar will be able to surprise next time 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.990
 the answer followed late 2004 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:50.189
 on this all the continuation follows
