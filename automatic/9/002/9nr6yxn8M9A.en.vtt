because they're the extra bully animal
has<00:00:20.860> been<00:00:21.009> bred<00:00:21.250> to<00:00:21.400> produce<00:00:21.550> much<00:00:21.880> more

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
has been bred to produce much more

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.689

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
of all because they have actually been

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.240 
of all because they have actually been
bred<00:00:34.780> to<00:00:34.900> have<00:00:35.050> very<00:00:35.230> frankly<00:00:35.559> skin<00:00:35.949> things

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
bred to have very frankly skin things

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.350 
bred to have very frankly skin things
the<00:00:36.370> more<00:00:36.489> wrinkles<00:00:36.940> that<00:00:37.030> goes<00:00:37.180> more

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
the more wrinkles that goes more

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.689 
the more wrinkles that goes more
balloons<00:00:37.720> more<00:00:37.809> profit<00:00:38.379> what<00:00:38.920> happens<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.519> the

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
balloons more profit what happens is the

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.759 
balloons more profit what happens is the
rear<00:00:39.879> folds<00:00:40.210> of<00:00:40.300> skin<00:00:40.449> on<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.079> sheep<00:00:41.440> will

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
rear folds of skin on the sheep will

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.920 
rear folds of skin on the sheep will
accumulate<00:00:42.159> moisture<00:00:42.699> and<00:00:42.909> urine<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.239> feces

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
accumulate moisture and urine and feces

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.480 
accumulate moisture and urine and feces
that<00:00:44.200> will<00:00:44.290> attract<00:00:44.560> blowflies<00:00:45.100> which<00:00:45.340> will

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
that will attract blowflies which will

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.100 
that will attract blowflies which will
lay<00:00:45.580> their<00:00:45.760> eggs<00:00:45.940> little<00:00:46.330> hash<00:00:46.480> maggots<00:00:46.930> which

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
lay their eggs little hash maggots which

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.360 
lay their eggs little hash maggots which
can<00:00:47.290> eat<00:00:47.410> them<00:00:47.530> alive<00:00:47.590> and<00:00:48.130> that's<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.340> very

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
can eat them alive and that's a very

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.120 
can eat them alive and that's a very
painful<00:00:48.850> condition<00:00:49.480> for<00:00:49.660> my<00:00:49.900> strength<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.530> so

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
painful condition for my strength and so

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.650 
painful condition for my strength and so
what<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.460> Australian<00:00:52.030> farmers<00:00:52.300> will<00:00:52.420> often

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
what the Australian farmers will often

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.690 
what the Australian farmers will often
do<00:00:52.870> rather<00:00:53.800> than<00:00:53.920> breed<00:00:54.250> them<00:00:54.400> to<00:00:54.520> have

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
do rather than breed them to have

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.310 
do rather than breed them to have
smoother<00:00:55.090> skin<00:00:55.330> is<00:00:55.480> simply<00:00:55.780> cut<00:00:55.960> off<00:00:56.140> these

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
smoother skin is simply cut off these

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.170 
smoother skin is simply cut off these
ripples<00:00:56.739> of<00:00:56.920> skin<00:00:57.160> without<00:00:57.580> any<00:00:57.970> painkillers

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
ripples of skin without any painkillers

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.119 
ripples of skin without any painkillers
so<00:00:58.780> that's<00:00:58.960> about<00:00:59.050> this<00:00:59.380> whole<00:00:59.560> meal<00:00:59.800> so<00:00:59.950> again

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
so that's about this whole meal so again

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.920 
so that's about this whole meal so again
it's<00:01:00.340> very<00:01:00.370> painful<00:01:00.670> for<00:01:01.000> them<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.480> it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
it's very painful for them and it

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.750 
it's very painful for them and it
happens<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.379> about<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.739> millions<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:03.610> Lance

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
happens to about the millions of Lance

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.719 
happens to about the millions of Lance
each<00:01:03.940> year<00:01:04.560> and<00:01:05.560> it's<00:01:06.040> it's<00:01:06.340> meant<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.610> create

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
each year and it's it's meant to create

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.969 
each year and it's it's meant to create
a<00:01:06.910> smooth<00:01:07.270> full<00:01:07.510> free<00:01:07.720> scar<00:01:07.990> that's<00:01:08.200> resistant

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
a smooth full free scar that's resistant

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.380 
a smooth full free scar that's resistant
to<00:01:09.070> fly<00:01:09.250> strike<00:01:09.610> but<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:09.850> can<00:01:10.060> be<00:01:10.150> an<00:01:10.300> effective

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
to fly strike but it can be an effective

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.600 
to fly strike but it can be an effective
when<00:01:10.930> war<00:01:11.200> balloon<00:01:11.410> flies<00:01:11.650> our<00:01:11.979> chances<00:01:12.400> on

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
when war balloon flies our chances on

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.430 
when war balloon flies our chances on
your<00:01:12.880> mood

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.020 

so<00:01:15.950> some<00:01:16.130> people<00:01:16.370> don't<00:01:16.520> think<00:01:16.700> about<00:01:16.910> when

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
so some people don't think about when

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.430 
so some people don't think about when
they<00:01:17.150> go<00:01:17.270> vegan<00:01:17.510> about<00:01:17.990> there's<00:01:18.260> other

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
they go vegan about there's other

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.900 
they go vegan about there's other
