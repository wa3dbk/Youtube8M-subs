00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.639
 do not forget to combine the common system and chasms previously with the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.390
 first system ounce now combine the notes suffered simple note 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.180
 in five combinations as we did previously all starting in the note 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.720
 a1 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.329
 in the following way 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.689
 peres notes followed is a simple note parinacota or as you want 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.789
 look differently at a note they do but for all of them each in a box 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:32.670
 in the notes 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.710
 of eighths the following example would be a note 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.649
 in pair a silence and then a simple note the following example would be a 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.680
 simple note the silence after a separate note and then we will give the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.750
 notes pair 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.969
 separated by 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.269
 a space for one tab I support a silence of 8a 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.280
 And then with an exercise we will play 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.379
 a simple business note and then a simple note 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.180
 everything with this now with this new system this is the one that goes 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.020
 a radiant 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.920
 3 and 4 I will play only the first version starting at 1 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.359
 the five combinations one after the other so that they have as reference 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.280
 remember that this same exercise when you see it in graph 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.330
 they do not have to repeat everything again 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.490
 starting well 1 i 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 is that we are going but everything starting with one hundred 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.130
 and there it is 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.240
 well murciana 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.770
 remember not again 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.090
 move everything 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.509
 only once starting in a UFO 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.679
 then again to five combinations starting in two after 5 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.000
 migrations starting sky and that's the good thing that you just have to do it 4 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.690
 efficient we are again in three 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.010
 realize that 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.480
 it's as if we had already done it is common to think about it is not the other half 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.390
 of the compass the first half of the compass is equal the second then 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.900
 that is the good news 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.280
 everything is practical 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.959
 and I hope you have understood 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.349
 because that's how the logic of this whole system works and this course of 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.149
 drums 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:22.339
 yes, we do not suddenly have to return to understand how all this works 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:23.909
 of systems 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.559
 improvise with the hype 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.399
 go shifting well be odd 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.849
 simple note and then combining 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:32.670
 combinations
