was<00:01:12.320> Farrell<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:12.980> coming<00:01:13.340> out<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.610> argue<00:01:14.350> now

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
was Farrell is coming out to argue now

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.780 
was Farrell is coming out to argue now
with<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.710> back<00:01:15.890> into<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.160> dugout<00:01:16.400> because

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
with the back into the dugout because

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.840 
with the back into the dugout because
followed<00:01:17.780> his<00:01:17.900> runners<00:01:18.229> have<00:01:18.470> scored

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.910 

I<00:01:22.909> think<00:01:23.750> he<00:01:23.869> was<00:01:23.990> coming<00:01:24.260> out<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.380> dispute

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
I think he was coming out to dispute

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.310 
I think he was coming out to dispute
whether<00:01:25.070> or<00:01:25.220> not<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.430> was<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:25.580> home<00:01:25.759> run<00:01:26.320> he's

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
whether or not it was a home run he's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.180 
whether or not it was a home run he's
still<00:01:27.619> coming<00:01:27.920> on

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.640 

this<00:01:31.850> has<00:01:32.030> been<00:01:32.180> absolutely<00:01:32.360> crazy

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.070 

I<00:01:36.710> thought<00:01:37.430> that<00:01:37.730> ball<00:01:37.940> was<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.180> home<00:01:38.510> run<00:01:38.540> and

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
I thought that ball was a home run and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.880 
I thought that ball was a home run and
so<00:01:39.410> did<00:01:39.650> drew<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.190> so<00:01:40.400> did<00:01:40.610> Saltalamacchia

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
so did drew and so did Saltalamacchia

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.920 
so did drew and so did Saltalamacchia
the<00:01:42.890> umpire<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:43.250> went<00:01:43.670> out<00:01:43.790> called<00:01:44.300> it<00:01:44.510> right

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
the umpire that went out called it right

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.720 
the umpire that went out called it right
away<00:01:45.050> with<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.710> safe<00:01:45.950> sign<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.340> say<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:46.640> it

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
away with the safe sign to say that it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.250 
away with the safe sign to say that it
did<00:01:46.850> not<00:01:47.000> leave<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.390> yard<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.810> first<00:01:48.050> base

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
did not leave the yard the first base

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.780 
did not leave the yard the first base
umpire<00:01:48.650> yes<00:01:51.190> so<00:01:52.190> now<00:01:52.310> they're<00:01:52.490> gonna<00:01:52.580> get

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
umpire yes so now they're gonna get

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.830 
umpire yes so now they're gonna get
together<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.940> Red<00:01:56.090> Sox<00:01:56.360> are<00:01:56.540> going<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.720> get

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
together the Red Sox are going to get

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.750 
together the Red Sox are going to get
all<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.050> runs<00:01:57.290> regardless<00:01:58.070> yes<00:01:58.340> either<00:01:58.550> way

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
all the runs regardless yes either way

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.700 
all the runs regardless yes either way
they<00:01:58.970> win<00:01:59.180> either<00:01:59.390> way<00:02:02.110> and<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.260> thought<00:02:03.500> this

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
they win either way and I thought this

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.470 
they win either way and I thought this
is<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:03.950> home<00:02:04.130> run<00:02:04.160> we'll<00:02:04.580> take<00:02:04.790> another<00:02:05.090> look<00:02:05.300> at

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
is a home run we'll take another look at

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.180 
is a home run we'll take another look at
it<00:02:05.630> here<00:02:05.840> see<00:02:06.110> if<00:02:06.170> we<00:02:06.290> can<00:02:06.440> pick<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.710> up<00:02:06.920> I

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
it here see if we can pick it up I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.300 
it here see if we can pick it up I
thought<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:07.880> hit<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.149> top<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:09.010> of<00:02:10.010> the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
thought it hit the top of the of the

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.070 
thought it hit the top of the of the
wall<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:10.940> top<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.570> wall<00:02:11.780> for<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.200> home<00:02:12.410> run

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080
