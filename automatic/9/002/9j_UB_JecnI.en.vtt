00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.170 
and stage with you first thing I'll say
about<00:02:11.640> her<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.540> she's<00:02:12.930> obviously<00:02:13.350> red

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
about her is that she's obviously red

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.760 
about her is that she's obviously red
and<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> think<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.690> red<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.110> unfortunately

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
and the think the red is unfortunately

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.030 
and the think the red is unfortunately
is<00:02:16.950> far<00:02:17.190> too<00:02:17.340> bright

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
is far too bright

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.979 
is far too bright
and<00:02:19.159> she<00:02:19.340> was<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.700> course<00:02:19.879> more<00:02:20.269> burgundy<00:02:20.810> so

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
and she was of course more burgundy so

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.720 
and she was of course more burgundy so
of<00:02:21.049> color<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.620> her<00:02:21.799> roof<00:02:21.950> was<00:02:22.159> more<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> gray

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
of color and her roof was more a gray

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.170 
of color and her roof was more a gray
where<00:02:23.120> as<00:02:23.269> they've<00:02:23.450> given<00:02:23.719> her<00:02:23.870> yellow<00:02:24.939> and<00:02:25.939> so

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
where as they've given her yellow and so

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.690 
where as they've given her yellow and so
I<00:02:26.209> think<00:02:26.359> she's<00:02:26.629> a<00:02:26.659> bit<00:02:26.870> too<00:02:27.079> bright

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
I think she's a bit too bright

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.899 
I think she's a bit too bright
also<00:02:29.689> if<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.049> looking<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.469> me<00:02:30.590> for<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:31.609> isn't

gaps between his eyes and sometimes some
different<00:02:51.980> angles<00:02:52.480> making<00:02:53.480> like<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:53.870> had<00:02:53.959> no

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109

eyes<00:02:54.290> at<00:02:54.530> all<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.189> unfortunately<00:02:55.909> it's<00:02:56.599> the

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
eyes at all and unfortunately it's the

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.379 
eyes at all and unfortunately it's the
same<00:02:56.930> with<00:02:57.139> a<00:02:57.579> Victoria<00:02:58.579> however<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.150> don't

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
same with a Victoria however I don't

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:07.440 
same with a Victoria however I don't
think<00:02:59.510> it's<00:02:59.810> quite<00:02:59.959> as<00:03:00.079> bad<00:03:00.409> as<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:01.870> baked<00:03:02.870> loo<00:03:05.049> I

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
think it's quite as bad as a baked loo I

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.670 
think it's quite as bad as a baked loo I
say<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.480> think<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.900> fact<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.200> face<00:03:09.439> as

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
say I think that the fact the face as

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.149 
say I think that the fact the face as
well<00:03:09.859> although<00:03:10.340> it's<00:03:10.669> well<00:03:10.970> detailed<00:03:12.159> for

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
well although it's well detailed for

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.979 
well although it's well detailed for
most<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.579> pictures<00:03:13.939> and<00:03:14.419> from<00:03:14.840> what<00:03:14.959> I

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
most of the pictures and from what I

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.659 
most of the pictures and from what I
remember<00:03:15.079> of<00:03:15.439> watching<00:03:15.829> underground<00:03:16.280> Ernie

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
remember of watching underground Ernie

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.080 
remember of watching underground Ernie
on<00:03:16.790> TV<00:03:17.239> when<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.599> was<00:03:17.780> on<00:03:17.900> T<00:03:18.200> TV<00:03:18.799> was<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.879> she

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
on TV when it was on T TV was that she

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.839 
on TV when it was on T TV was that she
her<00:03:20.359> face<00:03:20.599> was<00:03:20.810> always<00:03:21.139> sort<00:03:21.379> of<00:03:21.470> happy

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
her face was always sort of happy

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.129 
her face was always sort of happy
whereas<00:03:22.849> this<00:03:22.970> one<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.329> think<00:03:23.389> it<00:03:23.750> makes<00:03:23.930> her

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
whereas this one I think it makes her

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.920 
whereas this one I think it makes her
look<00:03:24.229> like<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.560> fairly<00:03:25.069> stern<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:25.879> again<00:03:26.780> not

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
look like a fairly stern so again not

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.909 
look like a fairly stern so again not
100%<00:03:27.530> accurate

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.379

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
underneath Bakerloo and this one the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.360 
underneath Bakerloo and this one the
same<00:03:39.079> a<00:03:39.229> toe<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.530> doesn't<00:03:39.769> actually<00:03:39.889> say<00:03:40.190> when

same a toe it doesn't actually say when

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.110 
same a toe it doesn't actually say when
they<00:03:40.519> were<00:03:40.579> built

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
they were built

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.659 
they were built
it<00:03:41.870> says<00:03:42.079> Joella<00:03:42.530> which<00:03:42.919> is<00:03:43.099> the<00:03:43.250> name<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:43.579> the

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
it says Joella which is the name of the

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.759 
it says Joella which is the name of the
company<00:03:43.849> that<00:03:44.180> make<00:03:44.389> that<00:03:45.109> produced<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.709> show

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
company that make that produced the show

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.140 
company that make that produced the show
it<00:03:46.760> is<00:03:46.970> 2002<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.870> 2007

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
it is 2002 to 2007

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.920 
it is 2002 to 2007
I<00:03:50.209> think<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:51.290> range<00:03:51.500> was<00:03:51.799> released<00:03:52.459> in<00:03:52.699> around

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
I think the range was released in around

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.059 
I think the range was released in around
2006<00:03:53.930> 7-7<00:03:54.919> like<00:03:55.040> that<00:03:56.319> I'm<00:03:57.319> not<00:03:57.530> quite

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
2006 7-7 like that I'm not quite

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.439 
2006 7-7 like that I'm not quite
remember<00:03:58.310> when<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.699> show<00:03:58.879> was<00:03:59.030> first

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
remember when the show was first

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.569 
remember when the show was first
broadcast<00:03:59.750> but<00:04:00.409> I<00:04:00.560> know<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.979> range<00:04:01.190> was<00:04:01.430> just

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
broadcast but I know the range was just

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.479 
broadcast but I know the range was just
continued<00:04:02.060> in<00:04:02.180> 2009<00:04:03.169> and<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.129> we<00:04:04.250> can<00:04:04.400> only

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
continued in 2009 and so we can only

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.369 
continued in 2009 and so we can only
assume<00:04:04.699> it<00:04:05.030> was<00:04:05.150> any<00:04:05.269> time<00:04:05.510> between<00:04:05.689> then<00:04:06.139> that

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
assume it was any time between then that

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.819 
assume it was any time between then that
this<00:04:06.560> model<00:04:06.919> was<00:04:07.040> made<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:09.049> packaging<00:04:09.680> on<00:04:09.769> the

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
this model was made and packaging on the

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.580 
this model was made and packaging on the
model<00:04:10.069> is<00:04:10.280> again<00:04:10.760> really<00:04:11.000> really<00:04:11.299> good<00:04:11.560> like<00:04:12.560> a

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
model is again really really good like a

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.289 
model is again really really good like a
clue<00:04:13.989> it<00:04:14.989> has<00:04:15.169> the<00:04:15.439> Victoria<00:04:16.090> catchphrase<00:04:17.090> at

me saying that with the BAE clue he was

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.020 
me saying that with the BAE clue he was
very<00:04:52.830> very<00:04:53.099> heavy<00:04:53.990> um<00:04:54.990> Victoria<00:04:55.970> although<00:04:56.970> she

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
very very heavy um Victoria although she

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.640 
very very heavy um Victoria although she
feels<00:04:57.360> heavy<00:04:57.630> she<00:04:57.960> certainly<00:04:58.259> not<00:04:58.380> as<00:04:58.470> heavy

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
feels heavy she certainly not as heavy

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.460 
feels heavy she certainly not as heavy
as<00:04:58.740> Bakerloo<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.580> she<00:05:00.300> does<00:05:00.479> run<00:05:00.720> overall<00:05:01.440> a

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
as Bakerloo and she does run overall a

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.620 
as Bakerloo and she does run overall a
lot<00:05:01.800> better<00:05:02.009> than<00:05:02.250> Bakley<00:05:02.729> I<00:05:02.940> said

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
lot better than Bakley I said

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.760 
lot better than Bakley I said
unfortunately<00:05:03.780> when<00:05:04.259> she<00:05:04.380> does<00:05:04.530> go<00:05:04.710> around

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
unfortunately when she does go around

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.409 
unfortunately when she does go around
you<00:05:05.069> do<00:05:05.190> notice<00:05:05.430> a<00:05:05.580> bit<00:05:05.729> of<00:05:05.789> a<00:05:05.849> gap<00:05:06.030> between<00:05:06.060> her

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
you do notice a bit of a gap between her

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.300 
you do notice a bit of a gap between her
eyes<00:05:06.569> and<00:05:06.930> sometimes<00:05:07.380> but<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.740> don't<00:05:07.860> think<00:05:08.130> it

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
eyes and sometimes but I don't think it

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.070 
eyes and sometimes but I don't think it
was<00:05:08.370> quite<00:05:08.580> as<00:05:08.729> bad<00:05:08.909> as<00:05:09.060> BAE<00:05:09.210> Clunes<00:05:09.539> looks<00:05:09.930> it

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
was quite as bad as BAE Clunes looks it

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.260 
was quite as bad as BAE Clunes looks it
from<00:05:10.259> the<00:05:10.319> front<00:05:10.500> now<00:05:10.710> from<00:05:11.639> this<00:05:11.759> angle<00:05:11.970> it's

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
from the front now from this angle it's

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.969 
from the front now from this angle it's
not<00:05:12.419> too<00:05:12.569> bad<00:05:12.780> really<00:05:12.990> you<00:05:13.229> can't<00:05:13.470> really<00:05:13.770> see

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
not too bad really you can't really see

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.559 
not too bad really you can't really see
the<00:05:14.099> gaps<00:05:14.280> between<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.610> eyes<00:05:14.819> whereas<00:05:15.360> unless

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
the gaps between the eyes whereas unless

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.170 
the gaps between the eyes whereas unless
Lysol<00:05:15.990> change<00:05:16.319> it<00:05:16.560> you<00:05:17.550> see<00:05:17.699> the<00:05:17.819> gap<00:05:18.000> and

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
Lysol change it you see the gap and

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.730 
Lysol change it you see the gap and
sometimes<00:05:18.539> it<00:05:18.659> looked<00:05:18.810> like<00:05:18.990> now<00:05:19.409> it<00:05:19.560> looks

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
sometimes it looked like now it looks

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.200 
sometimes it looked like now it looks
like<00:05:19.830> she's<00:05:20.039> got<00:05:20.159> her<00:05:20.340> eyes<00:05:20.490> it's<00:05:20.759> all<00:05:20.849> sort<00:05:21.180> of

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
like she's got her eyes it's all sort of

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.570 
like she's got her eyes it's all sort of
thing<00:05:21.360> really<00:05:21.949> and<00:05:22.949> so<00:05:23.159> it's<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.340> bit<00:05:23.460> of<00:05:23.520> a

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
thing really and so it's a bit of a

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.730 
thing really and so it's a bit of a
shame<00:05:23.840> but<00:05:24.840> I<00:05:24.900> suppose<00:05:25.169> it's<00:05:25.409> because<00:05:25.560> of<00:05:25.650> the

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
shame but I suppose it's because of the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.930 
shame but I suppose it's because of the
shape<00:05:25.919> of<00:05:26.039> her<00:05:26.129> face<00:05:26.159> is<00:05:26.550> where<00:05:26.729> I<00:05:26.759> want<00:05:26.909> to

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
shape of her face is where I want to

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.550 
shape of her face is where I want to
think<00:05:27.180> as<00:05:27.389> well<00:05:27.539> if<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.990> eyes<00:05:28.139> is<00:05:28.319> maybe<00:05:28.469> just

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
think as well if the eyes is maybe just

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.439 
think as well if the eyes is maybe just
a<00:05:28.740> bit<00:05:28.889> closer<00:05:29.099> maybe<00:05:29.849> it'd<00:05:30.060> been<00:05:30.240> a<00:05:30.270> bit

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
a bit closer maybe it'd been a bit

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.480 
a bit closer maybe it'd been a bit
better<00:05:30.680> another<00:05:31.680> thing<00:05:31.860> I<00:05:31.949> noticed<00:05:31.979> as<00:05:32.340> well

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
better another thing I noticed as well

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.520 
better another thing I noticed as well
as<00:05:32.639> with<00:05:32.819> Victoria<00:05:33.389> Shiism<00:05:34.020> a<00:05:34.139> lot<00:05:34.319> longer

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
as with Victoria Shiism a lot longer

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.189 
as with Victoria Shiism a lot longer
than<00:05:34.860> her<00:05:35.250> coach<00:05:35.550> where<00:05:36.060> his<00:05:36.150> baked<00:05:36.360> lose<00:05:36.719> but

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
than her coach where his baked lose but

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.839 
than her coach where his baked lose but
the<00:05:37.319> face<00:05:37.530> was<00:05:37.560> more<00:05:37.979> or<00:05:38.069> less<00:05:38.099> the<00:05:38.340> same<00:05:38.550> sort

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
the face was more or less the same sort

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.080 
the face was more or less the same sort
of<00:05:38.880> length<00:05:40.400> so<00:05:41.400> that's<00:05:41.610> something<00:05:41.789> rather

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
of length so that's something rather

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.249 
of length so that's something rather
unusual<00:05:43.759> also<00:05:44.759> you<00:05:45.569> may<00:05:45.719> remember<00:05:45.930> me<00:05:46.110> saying

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
unusual also you may remember me saying

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:47.570 
unusual also you may remember me saying
that<00:05:46.440> we've<00:05:46.560> baked<00:05:46.740> glue<00:05:47.009> I<00:05:47.039> was<00:05:47.279> worried<00:05:47.550> that

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
that we've baked glue I was worried that

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.370 
that we've baked glue I was worried that
he<00:05:47.759> might<00:05:47.940> be<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.120> bit<00:05:48.300> too<00:05:48.479> wide<00:05:48.719> and<00:05:49.199> at<00:05:49.289> the

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
he might be a bit too wide and at the

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.860 
he might be a bit too wide and at the
front<00:05:49.500> Victoria's<00:05:50.190> not<00:05:50.370> too<00:05:50.580> wide<00:05:50.819> she<00:05:51.719> does

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
front Victoria's not too wide she does

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.420 
front Victoria's not too wide she does
have<00:05:52.020> these<00:05:52.139> bars<00:05:52.440> inside<00:05:53.009> of<00:05:53.190> her<00:05:53.250> bow<00:05:53.400> and

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
have these bars inside of her bow and

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.089

same<00:05:53.759> on<00:05:53.940> her<00:05:54.090> coach<00:05:54.360> and<00:05:54.870> stick<00:05:55.349> out<00:05:55.500> a<00:05:55.529> bit<00:05:55.620> so

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
same on her coach and stick out a bit so

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.230 
same on her coach and stick out a bit so
they<00:05:56.279> might<00:05:56.430> catch<00:05:56.699> on<00:05:56.940> your<00:05:56.969> platform<00:05:58.819> but<00:05:59.819> so

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
they might catch on your platform but so

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.430 
they might catch on your platform but so
I<00:06:00.270> don't<00:06:00.479> think<00:06:00.690> in<00:06:00.810> general<00:06:00.990> you're<00:06:01.319> gonna

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
I don't think in general you're gonna

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.909 
I don't think in general you're gonna
have<00:06:01.680> much<00:06:01.889> of<00:06:02.130> an<00:06:02.250> issue<00:06:02.370> at<00:06:02.610> all<00:06:02.819> I<00:06:03.740> said<00:06:04.740> she

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
have much of an issue at all I said she

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.320 
have much of an issue at all I said she
does<00:06:05.069> run<00:06:05.219> really<00:06:05.580> well<00:06:05.610> we're<00:06:05.880> not<00:06:06.000> certainly

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
does run really well we're not certainly

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.879 
does run really well we're not certainly
recommended<00:06:06.810> the<00:06:06.960> ghetto<00:06:07.289> and<00:06:07.500> it's<00:06:07.620> really

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
recommended the ghetto and it's really

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.279 
recommended the ghetto and it's really
nice<00:06:08.039> to<00:06:08.190> have<00:06:08.279> a<00:06:08.310> bath<00:06:08.610> collection<00:06:09.180> look<00:06:10.080> said

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
nice to have a bath collection look said

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.499 
nice to have a bath collection look said
she<00:06:10.409> doesn't<00:06:10.560> 100%<00:06:11.159> look<00:06:11.310> like<00:06:11.490> a<00:06:11.520> TV<00:06:11.940> series

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:12.509 
she doesn't 100% look like a TV series

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.330 
she doesn't 100% look like a TV series
model<00:06:14.479> but<00:06:15.479> I<00:06:15.509> think<00:06:15.810> I'd<00:06:16.469> give<00:06:16.710> it<00:06:16.830> an<00:06:17.009> 8<00:06:17.279> out

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
model but I think I'd give it an 8 out

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.800 
model but I think I'd give it an 8 out
of<00:06:17.580> 10<00:06:18.560> I<00:06:19.560> think<00:06:20.279> that's<00:06:20.849> fairly<00:06:21.150> reasonable

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
of 10 I think that's fairly reasonable

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.379 
of 10 I think that's fairly reasonable
yes<00:06:25.190> I'm<00:06:26.190> really<00:06:26.370> pleased<00:06:26.639> to<00:06:26.789> have<00:06:26.940> it<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.270> it

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
yes I'm really pleased to have it and it

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.320 
yes I'm really pleased to have it and it
was<00:06:27.509> it<00:06:27.779> was<00:06:27.840> certainly<00:06:28.199> a<00:06:28.259> good<00:06:28.979> buy<00:06:29.219> and<00:06:30.000> also

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
was it was certainly a good buy and also

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.719 
was it was certainly a good buy and also
also<00:06:30.810> you've<00:06:31.229> got<00:06:31.380> to<00:06:31.500> remember<00:06:31.710> that<00:06:31.949> this<00:06:32.610> is

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
also you've got to remember that this is

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.579 
also you've got to remember that this is
obviously<00:06:33.029> a<00:06:33.120> children's<00:06:33.509> toy<00:06:33.779> so<00:06:34.139> nothing's

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:34.589 
obviously a children's toy so nothing's

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:36.170 
obviously a children's toy so nothing's
can<00:06:34.889> be<00:06:34.979> a<00:06:35.009> hundred<00:06:35.159> percent<00:06:35.279> accurate<00:06:35.940> I<00:06:36.029> mean

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
can be a hundred percent accurate I mean

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.410 
can be a hundred percent accurate I mean
I'm

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
I'm

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.390

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
of an adult clip so I'm 21 more than a

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.670 
of an adult clip so I'm 21 more than a
doll<00:06:38.550> clicks<00:06:38.790> that<00:06:39.000> they<00:06:39.750> don't<00:06:39.930> anything<00:06:40.410> and

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
similarities they said they just could

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.480 
similarities they said they just could
be<00:06:48.240> a<00:06:48.270> few<00:06:48.510> things<00:06:48.750> that<00:06:48.960> were<00:06:49.110> a<00:06:49.770> bit<00:06:50.310> better

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490
