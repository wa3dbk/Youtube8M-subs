00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.290 
hey guys this is g-man and I want to

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.920 
hey guys this is g-man and I want to
show<00:00:03.379> you<00:00:03.470> my<00:00:03.590> newest<00:00:03.920> 3d<00:00:04.220> printer<00:00:04.609> I<00:00:04.930> just

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
show you my newest 3d printer I just

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.420 
show you my newest 3d printer I just
finished<00:00:06.230> building<00:00:06.380> this<00:00:06.650> the<00:00:06.770> other<00:00:06.890> day<00:00:07.130> and

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.430 
finished building this the other day and

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.370 
finished building this the other day and
I'm<00:00:07.970> finally<00:00:08.360> getting<00:00:08.480> consistently<00:00:09.200> good

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
I'm finally getting consistently good

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.820 
I'm finally getting consistently good
prints<00:00:09.680> on<00:00:09.860> it<00:00:10.389> so<00:00:11.389> this<00:00:11.599> is<00:00:11.660> a<00:00:11.840> delta<00:00:12.349> 3d

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
prints on it so this is a delta 3d

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.999 
prints on it so this is a delta 3d
printer<00:00:13.330> it's<00:00:14.330> specifically<00:00:14.809> the<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.469> Rostov

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
printer it's specifically the the Rostov

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.239 
printer it's specifically the the Rostov
printer<00:00:16.689> I've<00:00:17.689> built<00:00:17.929> it<00:00:18.140> because<00:00:18.199> uh<00:00:18.380> I<00:00:18.919> chose

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:19.249 
printer I've built it because uh I chose

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:21.550 
printer I've built it because uh I chose
this<00:00:19.429> design<00:00:19.849> because<00:00:20.599> I<00:00:20.810> felt<00:00:21.289> like<00:00:21.349> I<00:00:21.499> can

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
this design because I felt like I can

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.979 
this design because I felt like I can
make<00:00:21.829> it<00:00:21.949> easily<00:00:22.359> since<00:00:23.359> it<00:00:23.479> uses<00:00:23.749> a<00:00:23.810> lot<00:00:23.960> of

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:23.989 
make it easily since it uses a lot of

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.960 
make it easily since it uses a lot of
plywood<00:00:24.499> parts<00:00:25.300> but<00:00:26.300> uh<00:00:26.979> here<00:00:27.979> it<00:00:28.069> is<00:00:28.220> this

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
plywood parts but uh here it is this

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.049 
plywood parts but uh here it is this
printer<00:00:29.419> is<00:00:29.539> really<00:00:29.869> tall<00:00:30.109> I<00:00:30.759> the<00:00:31.759> building

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
printer is really tall I the building

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.330 
printer is really tall I the building
all<00:00:32.210> I<00:00:32.239> am<00:00:32.329> is<00:00:32.480> is<00:00:32.899> 20<00:00:33.350> centimeters<00:00:33.829> by<00:00:33.980> 20

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
all I am is is 20 centimeters by 20

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.939 
all I am is is 20 centimeters by 20
centimeters<00:00:34.879> and<00:00:35.239> it<00:00:35.899> can<00:00:36.019> print<00:00:36.230> things<00:00:36.440> 40

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
centimeters and it can print things 40

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.639 
centimeters and it can print things 40
centimeters<00:00:37.460> tall<00:00:37.750> so<00:00:38.750> that<00:00:38.899> that's<00:00:39.170> twice<00:00:39.440> as

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
centimeters tall so that that's twice as

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.119 
centimeters tall so that that's twice as
tall<00:00:39.800> of<00:00:39.949> another<00:00:40.160> printer<00:00:40.579> can<00:00:40.730> do<00:00:41.769> and<00:00:42.769> it

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
tall of another printer can do and it

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.509 
tall of another printer can do and it
uses<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.460> really<00:00:43.820> unique<00:00:44.089> design<00:00:45.129> it<00:00:46.129> operates

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
uses a really unique design it operates

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.000 
uses a really unique design it operates
using<00:00:46.699> three<00:00:47.359> towers<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:48.109> three<00:00:48.289> arms<00:00:48.739> to

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
using three towers and three arms to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.869 
using three towers and three arms to
move<00:00:49.129> this<00:00:49.429> the<00:00:49.730> printhead<00:00:50.420> aroud<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:52.640> then

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
move this the printhead aroud and then

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.009 
move this the printhead aroud and then
on<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.949> print<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.850> heat<00:00:56.030> bed<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.510> always

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
on the print the heat bed is a always

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.130 
on the print the heat bed is a always
stationary<00:00:57.649> on<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:57.920> ground

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
stationary on the ground

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.649 
stationary on the ground
so<00:01:00.140> anyway<00:01:00.440> over<00:01:00.679> here<00:01:00.920> I<00:01:00.949> have<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.659> the

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
so anyway over here I have the the

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.689 
so anyway over here I have the the
extruder<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.199> it<00:01:03.559> uses<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:03.859> boat<00:01:04.250> in<00:01:04.430> tube

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
extruder and it uses a boat in tube

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.620 
extruder and it uses a boat in tube
defeat<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.750> plastic<00:01:05.960> into<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.500> nozzle

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
defeat the the plastic into the nozzle

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.210 
defeat the the plastic into the nozzle
this<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.689> just<00:01:09.020> your<00:01:09.200> regular<00:01:09.229> Gregg's

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
this is just your regular Gregg's

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.020 
this is just your regular Gregg's
extruder<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:12.020> haven't<00:01:12.350> made<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:13.030> eventually

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
extruder and I haven't made a eventually

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.300 
extruder and I haven't made a eventually
I'm<00:01:14.119> gonna<00:01:14.240> make<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.420> spool<00:01:14.869> holder<00:01:15.259> for<00:01:16.159> this

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
I'm gonna make a spool holder for this

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.060 
I'm gonna make a spool holder for this
spool<00:01:16.610> holder<00:01:16.969> it'll<00:01:17.450> be<00:01:17.570> uh<00:01:17.600> right<00:01:17.960> there<00:01:18.200> but

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
spool holder it'll be uh right there but

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.139 
spool holder it'll be uh right there but
I<00:01:19.100> haven't<00:01:19.280> gone<00:01:19.430> around<00:01:19.759> is<00:01:19.880> doing<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.180> yeah

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
I haven't gone around is doing that yeah

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.410 
I haven't gone around is doing that yeah
so<00:01:23.259> anyway<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:25.070> here<00:01:25.219> sort<00:01:25.579> of<00:01:25.670> here<00:01:26.090> as<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:26.299> is

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
so anyway the here sort of here as it is

see<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.140> got<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.440> fan<00:01:50.770> on<00:01:50.979> it<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.280> keep<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.549> a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
see I got a fan on it to keep it a

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
see I got a fan on it to keep it a
little<00:01:51.640> cooler<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.490> here<00:01:54.759> are<00:01:54.850> some<00:01:55.000> prints<00:01:55.509> I

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
little cooler and here are some prints I

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.770 
little cooler and here are some prints I
did<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.590> white<00:01:56.799> ones<00:01:57.039> I<00:01:57.250> printed<00:01:57.729> on<00:01:58.180> my<00:01:58.539> first

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
did the white ones I printed on my first

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.779 
did the white ones I printed on my first
printer<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.409> these<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.159> orange<00:02:00.460> ones<00:02:00.670> I

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
printer and these the orange ones I

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.389 
printer and these the orange ones I
printed<00:02:01.179> on<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:02.350> one<00:02:02.470> I<00:02:02.500> just<00:02:02.649> did<00:02:02.920> now<00:02:03.100> and

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
printed on the one I just did now and

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.510 
printed on the one I just did now and
they<00:02:04.360> look<00:02:04.390> but<00:02:05.170> he's<00:02:05.289> basically<00:02:05.679> exactly<00:02:06.460> the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
they look but he's basically exactly the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.410 
they look but he's basically exactly the
same<00:02:06.789> which<00:02:07.060> is<00:02:07.240> a<00:02:07.270> which<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.960> good<00:02:08.170> thing

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
same which is a which is a good thing

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.960 
same which is a which is a good thing
they<00:02:10.420> both<00:02:10.630> look<00:02:10.810> good<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.860> right<00:02:12.670> now<00:02:12.760> I'm

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
they both look good and right now I'm

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.240 
they both look good and right now I'm
printing<00:02:13.269> an<00:02:13.569> octopus<00:02:14.170> but<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:14.950> one's<00:02:15.160> a

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
printing an octopus but this one's a

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.250 
printing an octopus but this one's a
little<00:02:15.370> different<00:02:15.850> because<00:02:15.940> I'm<00:02:16.810> preaching

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
little different because I'm preaching

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.559 
little different because I'm preaching
at<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.410> point<00:02:17.890> one<00:02:18.280> millimetre<00:02:19.030> layer<00:02:19.269> height

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
at a point one millimetre layer height

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.050 
at a point one millimetre layer height
and<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.620> smallest<00:02:20.950> basically<00:02:21.910> any

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
and that is the smallest basically any

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.410 
and that is the smallest basically any
printer<00:02:22.450> can<00:02:22.630> print<00:02:23.549> this<00:02:24.549> time<00:02:24.850> it's<00:02:25.120> looking

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
printer can print this time it's looking

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.220 
printer can print this time it's looking
pretty<00:02:25.569> good<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:25.810> far

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
pretty good so far

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.400 
pretty good so far
he's<00:02:26.650> got<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.860> little<00:02:27.100> more<00:02:27.220> done<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.810> this

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
he's got a little more done but this

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.289 
he's got a little more done but this
yeah<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:29.830> thing<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.250> really<00:02:30.760> high<00:02:31.000> for

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
yeah this thing is a really high for

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.930 
yeah this thing is a really high for
high<00:02:31.569> resolution<00:02:32.340> because<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:33.910> a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
high resolution because this is a

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.850 
high resolution because this is a
highest<00:02:34.690> resolution<00:02:34.989> I<00:02:35.260> can<00:02:35.440> print<00:02:35.620> something

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
highest resolution I can print something

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.100 
highest resolution I can print something
and<00:02:36.220> it's<00:02:36.340> coming<00:02:36.610> out<00:02:36.700> great

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
so yeah I've got the LCD screen here so

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.700 
so yeah I've got the LCD screen here so
I<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.620> control<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.820> with<00:02:45.000> an<00:02:45.270> SD<00:02:45.600> card<00:02:45.710> it's

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
I can control it with an SD card it's

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.890 
I can control it with an SD card it's
better<00:02:46.920> than<00:02:47.100> using<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.780> better<00:02:48.780> than

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
better than using a better than

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.340 
better than using a better than
controlling<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.410> with<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> computer<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.810> yeah

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
controlling it with a computer so yeah

controlling it with a computer so yeah
anyway<00:02:52.740> that's<00:02:53.340> my<00:02:53.460> 3d<00:02:53.760> printer<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.560> still

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
anyway that's my 3d printer it's I still

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.530 
anyway that's my 3d printer it's I still
got<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.070> lot<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.280> learn<00:02:56.460> about<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.450> I'm
