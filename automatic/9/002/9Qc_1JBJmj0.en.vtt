00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.930
 i 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.940
 hi friends from my house today we have come 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.040
 to a chalet where a family lives with 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.660
 children is a house full of color that 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.980
 will love you accompany me in the 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.980
 we're going to see her 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.060
 i 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.310
 we are already inside the first thing that we 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.600
 receives in the house is the heat now what 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.970
 you are going to see two zones have been created 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.430
 first one more of social gathering more a zone 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.590
 of being and another one for enjoyment for 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.660
 watch TV with family a 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.489
 house full of color and especially of 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.650
 details painted with a certain air 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.960
 industrial are everywhere by 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.580
 example an old sofa recovered that 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.530
 we can upholster it becomes a 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.769
 star piece we will continue to see the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.769
 home 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.790
 and the other part of sanz quoted this is the 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.280
 that I told you that it is more the zone of 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.900
 the family of television enjoyment 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.270
 we can see perfectly the style that 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.770
 reflects the whole house a mixture between 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.330
 this vintage that I spoke to you 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.010
 example we are going to surprise with some 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.380
 legs a sewing machine essences 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.960
 recovered and other furniture perez by 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.650
 here and the industrial notes set 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.700
 for example a brick wall that 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.750
 he finds standing where it says 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.300
 viewfinder 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.370
 a funny detail in the part 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.110
 top of the wall has been fixed a 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.880
 fringe blackboard holder to leave the 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.260
 messages that the family that gives the 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.240
 family that lives in this house at 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.950
 try to receive people and for that not 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.990
 there is a date in the winter calendar 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.119
 summer make good time in cave gets 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.400
 for that they have enabled this small 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.500
 closed porch with a glass and has 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.790
 created here a little room of stark there 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.009
 to keep in mind that they also live 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.410
 children and this house is to enjoy it 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.150
 very vivid the armchairs made with 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.670
 mats that are very practical 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.710
 they are very functional , a 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.570
 very cozy corner up despite being 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.270
 a car is taken care of the signed details 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.549
 on the wall wallpaper 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.710
 and then the outside is what 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.840
 It is the patio that can be enjoyed in shapes 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.239
 when a sunny day comes out in that patio 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.640
 They make a lot of life and you will see how it is 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.500
 decorated very functional also because it 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.660
 has chosen a micro-cement floor that 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.519
 holds perfectly to defend him has 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.370
 created from the same material a table where 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.799
 is supported barbecue on summer table 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.930
 to receive and eat out and a zone of 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.470
 this you are going to see how they have 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.170
 conjugate in textiles and wine in 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.060
 taken from trips embroidered again 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.370
 a lot of color and I want you to look at a 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.590
 detail in addition to the exterior because it is 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.780
 sure many of you have raised the 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.640
 cover our floor looked like 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.040
 functional other carpets for the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.769
 outside are very useful have been put 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.769
 one plastic holds more 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.640
 since it 's a chalet 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.050
 Rooms are on the first floor 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.420
 we have climbed the stairs and we 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.850
 we found in the master bedroom 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.220
 here also the use of color is patent 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.500
 look at the headboard only with paper 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.210
 painted the camera was then decorated 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.490
 more play with cushions also from 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.500
 floral prints and animals but 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.300
 everything very striking is precisely that 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.430
 color that has been used to give it 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.160
 the current point to the decoration that 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.290
 still have good here retro furniture 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.090
 vintage recovered for example this 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.880
 chair of the owner of the house is very 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.910
 handyman and has put a new upholstery 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.370
 with a lot of color we enter the 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.100
 cooks a very spacious and light 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.660
 natural the owners of the house as 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.030
 we have told you they love to receive 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.190
 receive guests in them will receive with 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.750
 He and friends who had done it 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.150
 seen that the room has been divided in two 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.520
 areas but two things to be had not 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.880
 table is here in the kitchen and it 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:53.880
 find a job 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:56.970
 but it was precisely my diary where 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.040
 they receive and those on the wall that those ideas 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.870
 We like doubts about you and I know that a 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.120
 half of a box with the calendar 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.220
 the tasks of the family and that picture is 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.110
 of chalk paint gives decorated with a 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.680
 molding but the blackboard entry what 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.680
