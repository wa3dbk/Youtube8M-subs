anyway to start off I thought capacity

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.920 
anyway to start off I thought capacity

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
to have so I could go over each feature

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.359 
to have so I could go over each feature

long video I'm going to try to to keep
this<00:02:13.680> down<00:02:13.980> under<00:02:14.580> well<00:02:15.510> under<00:02:15.810> 10<00:02:16.050> minutes<00:02:16.410> if

this down under well under 10 minutes if
I<00:02:16.709> can<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:18.120> I'll<00:02:18.300> just<00:02:18.480> kind<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.780> briefly<00:02:19.050> go

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
I can so I'll just kind of briefly go

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.470 
I can so I'll just kind of briefly go
over<00:02:19.560> what<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> consider<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.239> be<00:02:21.360> some

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
over what I consider to be some

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.220 
over what I consider to be some

with<00:02:25.410> these<00:02:25.620> weapons<00:02:25.860> being<00:02:26.930> maybe<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
with these weapons being maybe the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.940 
with these weapons being maybe the
perfect<00:02:28.620> weapon<00:02:29.010> for<00:02:29.040> shtf<00:02:30.500> let's<00:02:31.500> start<00:02:31.740> off

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
perfect weapon for shtf let's start off

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.140 
perfect weapon for shtf let's start off
over<00:02:32.220> here<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
over here the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.140 
over here the
10:22<00:02:34.150> but<00:02:35.079> I<00:02:35.110> just<00:02:35.530> don't<00:02:35.739> think<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.129> the<00:02:36.430> 22

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
10:22 but I just don't think that the 22

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.509 
10:22 but I just don't think that the 22
can<00:02:37.390> be<00:02:37.510> discounted<00:02:38.200> as<00:02:38.409> far<00:02:38.650> as<00:02:38.829> the<00:02:39.069> Ambo

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
can be discounted as far as the Ambo

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.229 
can be discounted as far as the Ambo
availability<00:02:40.329> cost<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:42.060> accuracy<00:02:43.060> this

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
availability cost and accuracy this

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.690 
availability cost and accuracy this
weapon<00:02:43.689> I<00:02:43.810> mean<00:02:43.989> maybe<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:44.500> just<00:02:44.620> hunting<00:02:45.489> or

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700

something<00:02:45.849> you<00:02:46.180> need<00:02:46.359> in<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.780> short<00:02:46.989> range

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
something you need in that short range

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.740 
something you need in that short range
this<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.579> going<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.849> be<00:02:49.000> really<00:02:49.329> good<00:02:49.480> for

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
this is going to be really good for

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.819 
this is going to be really good for

bad<00:03:11.010> fairly<00:03:12.010> accurate<00:03:12.519> I'd<00:03:12.879> say<00:03:13.150> up<00:03:13.629> to<00:03:13.689> 100

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.479

these the Mossberg ata the shotgun very

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.929 
these the Mossberg ata the shotgun very
versatile<00:03:25.329> I<00:03:26.069> mean<00:03:27.069> you<00:03:27.189> can<00:03:27.370> shoot<00:03:27.549> slugs

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
versatile I mean you can shoot slugs

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.610 
versatile I mean you can shoot slugs
through<00:03:28.269> it<00:03:28.329> for<00:03:28.540> hunting<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.109> you<00:03:29.200> can<00:03:29.379> hunt

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
through it for hunting so you can hunt

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.379 
through it for hunting so you can hunt
larger<00:03:30.099> game<00:03:31.019> short<00:03:32.019> range<00:03:32.760> we<00:03:33.760> have<00:03:33.790> probably

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
larger game short range we have probably

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.899 
larger game short range we have probably
nothing<00:03:34.989> really<00:03:35.439> pepper<00:03:35.889> you<00:03:36.370> know<00:03:36.400> as<00:03:36.639> far<00:03:36.849> as

a very short range close quarters a

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.689 
a very short range close quarters a
versatility<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:41.769> can<00:03:41.859> put<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.069> stock<00:03:42.370> on

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
versatility and you can put a stock on

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:48.360 
versatility and you can put a stock on

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
a great all-around gun I think for ST

a great all-around gun I think for ST
shtf<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:55.209> ar-15<00:03:58.260> probably<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.290> little<00:03:59.560> more

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
shtf the ar-15 probably a little more

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.619 
shtf the ar-15 probably a little more

most of the close quarters lethality I
don't<00:05:05.070> think<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.430> pistol<00:05:05.850> is<00:05:05.910> going<00:05:06.120> to

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
don't think the pistol is going to

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.050 
don't think the pistol is going to
compare<00:05:06.600> to<00:05:06.810> any<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.350> these<00:05:07.880> these<00:05:08.880> guns<00:05:10.490> so<00:05:11.490> my

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
compare to any of these these guns so my

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.570 
compare to any of these these guns so my
personal<00:05:12.419> choice<00:05:12.960> just<00:05:13.590> out<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:13.860> these<00:05:14.250> and

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
personal choice just out of these and

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.070 
personal choice just out of these and
obviously<00:05:15.060> there<00:05:15.270> are<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.419> lot<00:05:15.570> more<00:05:15.600> choices

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
obviously there are a lot more choices

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.200 
obviously there are a lot more choices
but<00:05:17.180> for<00:05:18.180> me<00:05:18.500> my<00:05:19.500> thoughts<00:05:19.860> on<00:05:20.220> shtf

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
but for me my thoughts on shtf

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.370 
but for me my thoughts on shtf
at<00:05:22.050> least<00:05:22.320> as<00:05:22.500> far<00:05:22.710> as<00:05:22.770> defense<00:05:23.250> is<00:05:24.320> going<00:05:25.320> to

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
at least as far as defense is going to

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.409 
at least as far as defense is going to
be<00:05:25.620> probably<00:05:26.190> this<00:05:27.350> ake<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.620> pistol<00:05:29.190> I<00:05:29.430> mean<00:05:30.180> it

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
be probably this ake a pistol I mean it

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.960 
be probably this ake a pistol I mean it
basically<00:05:30.750> like<00:05:31.380> I<00:05:31.530> said<00:05:31.560> it's<00:05:32.160> like<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:32.400> very

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
basically like I said it's like a very

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.040 
basically like I said it's like a very
compact<00:05:33.960> rifle<00:05:34.380> I<00:05:35.090> feel<00:05:36.090> like<00:05:36.300> that's<00:05:36.660> gonna

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
compact rifle I feel like that's gonna

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.930 
compact rifle I feel like that's gonna
be<00:05:37.350> the<00:05:37.500> easiest<00:05:37.860> one<00:05:38.220> in<00:05:38.430> all<00:05:38.610> of<00:05:38.789> these

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
be the easiest one in all of these

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.980 
be the easiest one in all of these
categories<00:05:39.979> the<00:05:40.979> ammo<00:05:41.490> is<00:05:41.850> arguable<00:05:42.510> maybe

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
categories the ammo is arguable maybe

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.010
