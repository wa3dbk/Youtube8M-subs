00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
loose leaves to reattach you would have

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:37.020 
loose leaves to reattach you would have
done<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.250> way<00:02:27.640> before<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.240> point<00:02:33.630> okay<00:02:36.030> so

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.210 
going to line it up with the absolute
top<00:02:49.390> edge<00:02:51.480> because<00:02:52.480> we<00:02:52.750> don't<00:02:53.019> want<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.920> be

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
top edge because we don't want it to be

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.540 
top edge because we don't want it to be
seen<00:02:55.560> when<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.650> get<00:02:56.769> more<00:02:56.920> proficient<00:02:57.100> you

can do things in one step if you can

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.080 
can do things in one step if you can
break<00:02:59.560> things<00:02:59.860> into<00:03:00.010> smaller<00:03:00.459> steps<00:03:00.880> it

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
break things into smaller steps it

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.479 
break things into smaller steps it
allows<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.800> wiggle<00:03:02.800> room<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.160> can<00:03:03.340> make<00:03:03.459> a

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
allows you wiggle room you can make a

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.259 
allows you wiggle room you can make a
mistake<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.269> back<00:03:04.600> up<00:03:05.549> okay<00:03:06.549> let's<00:03:06.790> see<00:03:07.120> when

and come back to it okay we've come back
to<00:03:34.550> our<00:03:34.670> book<00:03:34.960> hopefully<00:03:35.960> things<00:03:36.890> have<00:03:37.100> dried

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
to our book hopefully things have dried

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.810 
to our book hopefully things have dried
this<00:03:39.020> will<00:03:39.230> dried<00:03:39.620> nice<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.250> tight<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.640> the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
this will dried nice and tight to the

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.410 
this will dried nice and tight to the
spine<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:43.040> think<00:03:43.250> before<00:03:43.430> we<00:03:43.700> start<00:03:44.060> we<00:03:44.300> are

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
spine and I think before we start we are

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.940 
spine and I think before we start we are
going<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:46.450> get<00:03:47.450> rid<00:03:47.660> of<00:03:47.690> our<00:03:48.020> plastic<00:03:48.260> we're

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.580 
going to get rid of our plastic we're
going<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.459> trim<00:03:49.820> off<00:03:49.850> our<00:03:51.040> bandage<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.280> make<00:03:52.430> it
