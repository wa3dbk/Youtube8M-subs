00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:09.389
 strong of it's a good match against a nice team of Lille I think everything 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.579
 the world has been very focused very concerned 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.209
 he plays the game but the guts it's nice to be supported by the 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.189
 spectators 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.039
 sites 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.039
 it's important for us it was a very very difficult match 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.390
 for a successful working together debt in europe is very 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.699
 solidarity everyone real last-minute hope 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.060
 the tax center for everyone sometimes when 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.640
 it's a lot of good in the evening 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.360
 it makes 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.530
 between two hours later as well as a slide show the situation is no different 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.990
 that sarah super here for the little ones and deep for the club the supporters 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.950
 more afraid 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.940
 present tonight in turns to thank him for the star it goes on 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.160
 like that it's still feet as I did not understand what they are they 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 are very very strong offensively they are very very strong so 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.240
 we knew that they go up to have a good cause we can survive in the 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.189
 world is for them and they are 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:07.930
 they still support must 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.930
 we always find ourselves paying attention to one thing in fact 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.060
 he has forwards is to score the goal is to fight against the flames not 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.560
 only open rocker 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.649
 the Netherlands scored the winning goal so far we all 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.000
 defend from France 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.080
 we waited it does not surprise me is not the red card to address I think 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.520
 that we were good we made them doubt 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.860
 the rebound forum we held the match because we have jurors the match 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.780
 did not concede many opportunities from this team same amount in 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.100
 rise 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.890
 somewhere abbÃ¨s did and it feels good and according to our work for the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.990
 derby continue like that the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.220
 make common sense by matches like that the common solidarity to show this 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.820
 evening 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.200
 how to succeed in getting out it's a particular match will we pass we are 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.890
 in a logic and we continue on our logic of getting out of it 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.200
 I think you are asked to continue with that mindset there and 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 went looking even further that's all 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.040
 the case 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.639
