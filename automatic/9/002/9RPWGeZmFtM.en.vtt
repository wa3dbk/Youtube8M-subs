00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.760
 after a training camp in Abu Dhabi Henk 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.809
 to have played the exhibition matches 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.540
 trained a lot 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.559
 will begin again you fancy 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.289
 absolute 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.699
 is the pommel I think the whole team 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.880
 practice match always fun but again 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.460
 not 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.210
 you go nowhere to look where you sometimes 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.220
 state 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.740
 that is nice for me in terms of results 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.939
 but where in terms of points goes nowhere 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.949
 different 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.920
 so always scan from everyone and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.420
 see who is best at what position 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.700
 can work 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.559
 so nice according to the for the test but 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.820
 not for it helps her 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.590
 naturally it 's against you 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.360
 have it much nicer than 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.960
 friendly games and how 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.760
 is it then to start out in zwolle 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.989
 you have to start somewhere or at home or out 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.129
 so does not matter 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.210
 we still have 1716 if I'm right 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.559
 opponents 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.059
 so really awesome zwolle doesn't matter 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.500
 so much out of it is a tough match 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.180
 you it is not just that you just 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.860
 win with two fingers in the nose 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.049
 and yes we are going to give up with 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.330
 or two but that does not take away from us 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.220
 watch out for them for their strident 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.290
 switching and for their game they 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.760
 can play there what kind of impression 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.990
 you of his 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.659
 yeah now you don't know what they do now 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.280
 again to long rest period again 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.840
 start when you had finished 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.549
 first season 11 look they are great 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.070
 started a very good soccer player 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.799
 team that practically every match well 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.540
 football also dominated and the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.250
 last we these 10 weeks it just quite 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.869
 have done bad with the very bad 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.420
 results and football law too 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.560
 slower but good is the potential 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.689
 we got that at the start of it 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.619
 to see the season 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.720
 of course they now have a few again 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.460
 new boys and so yes I am 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.689
 wondering how they too can they for 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.220
 day will come 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.140
 yes they have some guys on that fall 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.790
 and in the days they go blacker 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.159
 plays at vitesse 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.360
 what is that for young and for all 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.340
 good soccer player 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.689
 that's where it starts boy you 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.520
 which we are happy that he is with 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.930
 who will certainly help us with that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.610
 second season elsewhere I do have one 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.320
 clear picture that has run out 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.450
 position of course wild with patrick van 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.630
 aanholt but we are satisfied with it 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.550
 so he will play our way 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.710
 to get to know preferably so quickly 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.660
 possible and where necessary 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.790
 help us after a very good first 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.500
 you have strengthened yourself during the season 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.000
 also good during the winter break 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.640
 games played while standing 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.410
 you think you now but we have to go further 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.480
 stand as follow yes because a team go 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.510
 take into account vitesse they did 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.250
 all now more needs to the tray, and 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.530
 again it will be a difficult job because it 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.710
 gets harder and better every time 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.180
 you play the more teams watch out for 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.240
 for good opponent is normal already 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.820
 their yes we are we we are becoming 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.070
 more favorite and then we always 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.350
 harder and then we have to face us 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.670
 we must arm our own against it 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.320
 and we are working hard on how it is 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.400
 reaal it with the rest of the week 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.400
 boys everybody fit 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.940
 me if you look at when you go 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.250
 theo of course still not that 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.600
 that speaks for itself 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.600
 We want to not frustrate 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.980
 completely fit is the we have two 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.250
 boys who are not yet eligible to play 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.680
 are also not yet in the selection 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.250
 and for the rest yes we can 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.250
 boys have
