actually<00:00:14.120> import<00:00:15.120> our<00:00:15.330> custom<00:00:15.870> texture<00:00:16.289> which

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
actually import our custom texture which

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.320 
actually import our custom texture which
I<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:17.039> right<00:00:17.340> here<00:00:17.400> as<00:00:18.330> my<00:00:18.990> green<00:00:19.470> or<00:00:19.650> PNG

our<00:00:34.290> mod<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.920> we're<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.640> create<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
our mod is and we're going to create a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.830 
our mod is and we're going to create a
new<00:00:36.420> folder<00:00:36.660> called<00:00:37.050> textures<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.840> then

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
new folder called textures and then

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.389 
new folder called textures and then
inside<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> folder<00:00:40.860> called<00:00:41.040> blocks

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
inside of this a folder called blocks

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.690 
inside of this a folder called blocks
and<00:00:42.410> then<00:00:43.410> we're<00:00:43.620> going<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.860> paste<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.370> our

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and then we're going to paste in our

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.540 
and then we're going to paste in our
green<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.719> dot<00:00:45.899> PNG<00:00:46.140> now<00:00:46.890> we're<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
green or dot PNG now we're going to

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.260 
green or dot PNG now we're going to
rename<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:49.039> the<00:00:50.039> name<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.910> our<00:00:52.610> our<00:00:53.610> block

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
rename this to the name of our our block

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.000 
rename this to the name of our our block
in<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> game<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.350> case<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.770> going

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
in the game so in this case it's going

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.779 
in the game so in this case it's going
to<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.280> blocked<00:00:56.969> tutorial<00:00:57.719> P&amp;G<00:00:59.000> so<00:01:00.000> oh<00:01:01.789> alright

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789

to be blocked tutorial P&amp;G so oh alright
so<00:01:03.300> now<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.650> actually<00:01:04.799> add<00:01:05.420> some<00:01:06.420> code<00:01:06.689> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
so now we can actually add some code to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.969 
so now we can actually add some code to
our<00:01:07.790> lock<00:01:08.790> clasp<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.560> what<00:01:10.560> we're<00:01:10.680> going<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
our lock clasp and what we're going to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.149 
our lock clasp and what we're going to
do<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.580> go<00:01:11.760> into<00:01:11.909> our<00:01:12.140> block<00:01:13.140> class<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
do is go into our block class and the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.149 
do is go into our block class and the
first<00:01:14.369> thing<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:15.090> want<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> do<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.720> add<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.770> cus

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
first thing we want to do is add a cus

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.640 
first thing we want to do is add a cus
is<00:01:17.340> add<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> string<00:01:18.420> inside<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.930> our<00:01:19.049> class<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
is add a string inside of our class and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.450 
is add a string inside of our class and
this<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.040> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.369> be<00:01:20.509> string<00:01:22.040> will<00:01:23.040> call<00:01:23.250> it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
this is going to be string will call it

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.320 
this is going to be string will call it
texture<00:01:24.060> name<00:01:25.490> now<00:01:26.490> we're<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.939> declare

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
texture name now we're going to declare

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.359 
texture name now we're going to declare
the<00:01:27.810> value<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> string<00:01:28.740> inside<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.250> our

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the value of the string inside of our

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.819 
the value of the string inside of our
constructor<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.930> we're<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> add<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.799> new

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
constructor so we're going to add a new

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.749 
constructor so we're going to add a new
parameter<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.659> string

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
parameter and this is going to be string

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.999 
parameter and this is going to be string
texture<00:01:35.759> name<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.310> then<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.670> say<00:01:38.909> texture

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
texture name and then we can say texture

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.929 
texture name and then we can say texture
name<00:01:41.030> equal<00:01:42.030> equals<00:01:42.899> texture<00:01:43.860> name<00:01:44.670> we

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
name equal equals texture name we

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.910 
name equal equals texture name we
actually<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.659> say<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.079> dot<00:01:46.409> texture

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
actually have to say this dot texture

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.780 
actually have to say this dot texture
name<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:48.560> we're<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> set<00:01:50.130> texture<00:01:50.610> name

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
name and we're going to set texture name

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.420 
name and we're going to set texture name
to<00:01:51.090> private<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.369> Static<00:01:54.470> there<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.560> go<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.399> now

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to private and Static there we go so now

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.980 
to private and Static there we go so now
you'll<00:01:56.969> see<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.540> give<00:01:57.689> us<00:01:57.719> an

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
you'll see it's going to give us an

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.859 
you'll see it's going to give us an
error<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.560> we're<00:01:59.189> just<00:01:59.369> going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.689> set<00:02:00.689> our

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
error here we're just going to set our

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.810 
error here we're just going to set our
texture<00:02:01.469> name<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> same<00:02:02.280> thing<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.610> set

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
texture name to the same thing we set

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.600 
texture name to the same thing we set
our<00:02:02.969> unlock<00:02:03.420> alized<00:02:03.689> name<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.310> now<00:02:05.310> in

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
our unlock alized name to now in

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.589 
our unlock alized name to now in
previous<00:02:06.570> versions<00:02:07.250> we<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:09.149> used<00:02:09.420> our

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
previous versions we just used our

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.949 
previous versions we just used our
unlock<00:02:10.110> lized<00:02:10.379> name<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:12.090> was<00:02:12.540> easier

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
unlock lized name and that was easier

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.730 
unlock lized name and that was easier
because<00:02:13.260> we

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
because we

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.910 
because we
could<00:02:13.860> say<00:02:14.100> get<00:02:15.000> unlock<00:02:15.390> last<00:02:15.660> name<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.110> which

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
could say get unlock last name to which

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.010 
could say get unlock last name to which
would<00:02:17.400> only<00:02:17.760> return<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.830> right<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:20.520> now

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
would only return this right here now

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.640 
would only return this right here now
currently<00:02:22.020> get<00:02:22.650> unloaded<00:02:22.980> last<00:02:23.310> name<00:02:23.520> returns

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
currently get unloaded last name returns

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.210 
currently get unloaded last name returns
tile<00:02:25.650> dot<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.670> then<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.690> right<00:02:27.930> here<00:02:28.220> that's

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
tile dot and then this right here that's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.730 
tile dot and then this right here that's
not<00:02:29.430> really<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> problem<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.330> could<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.740> say

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
not really a problem you could just say

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.060 
not really a problem you could just say
get<00:02:32.190> unlock<00:02:32.730> last<00:02:33.030> name<00:02:33.440> when<00:02:34.440> we<00:02:34.470> add<00:02:34.710> in<00:02:34.920> our

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
get unlock last name when we add in our

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.000 
get unlock last name when we add in our
texture<00:02:35.610> code<00:02:35.880> later<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.800> way<00:02:37.950> you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
texture code later but that way you

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.100 
texture code later but that way you
would<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.700> say<00:02:38.970> rename<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.540> tile

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
would have to say rename this to tile

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.550 
would have to say rename this to tile
dot<00:02:40.830> block<00:02:41.130> tutorial<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.990> may<00:02:43.110> forget<00:02:43.260> to

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
dot block tutorial and you may forget to

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.320 
dot block tutorial and you may forget to
do<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.790> cause<00:02:45.000> some<00:02:45.210> issues

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
do that and it can cause some issues

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.990 
do that and it can cause some issues
later<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.500> like<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:46.860> do<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.190> I

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
later on so I just like to do this I

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.730 
later on so I just like to do this I
think<00:02:48.360> it's<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.810> lot<00:02:48.960> clearer<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.680> see<00:02:50.450> etc<00:02:51.450> etc

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
think it's a lot clearer to see etc etc

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.130 
think it's a lot clearer to see etc etc
now<00:02:52.740> we're<00:02:53.340> going<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.640> actually<00:02:53.820> add<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.600> method

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
now we're going to actually add a method

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.990 
now we're going to actually add a method
and<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.710> is<00:02:55.890> going<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.340> register<00:02:56.970> our

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
and this is going to register our

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.650 
and this is going to register our
texture<00:02:57.750> with<00:02:57.990> this<00:02:58.200> blog<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.460> at<00:02:59.730> side

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
texture with this blog so it is at side

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:08.410 
texture with this blog so it is at side
only<00:03:01.550> side<00:03:02.550> dot<00:03:02.910> client<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.080> all<00:03:04.440> caps<00:03:06.320> public

public void register icons icon register

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.800 
public void register icons icon register
and<00:03:16.800> we'll<00:03:17.010> call<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.220> reg<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:20.540> we<00:03:21.540> have<00:03:21.660> to

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
and we'll call this reg and we have to

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.570 
and we'll call this reg and we have to
import<00:03:22.140> side<00:03:22.500> only<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.030> icon<00:03:24.030> register<00:03:28.580> if

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
import side only and icon register if

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.540 
import side only and icon register if
it'll<00:03:30.000> let<00:03:30.270> me<00:03:30.390> import<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:32.840> there<00:03:33.840> we<00:03:33.960> go<00:03:34.550> and

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
it'll let me import it there we go and

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.940 
it'll let me import it there we go and
now<00:03:35.970> we<00:03:36.480> just<00:03:36.780> add<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.990> single<00:03:37.230> line<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:37.770> code

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
now we just add a single line of code

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.010 
now we just add a single line of code
inside<00:03:38.460> of<00:03:38.610> this<00:03:38.700> method<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.300> that<00:03:39.390> is<00:03:39.600> this

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
inside of this method and that is this

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:47.330 
inside of this method and that is this
dot<00:03:41.240> item<00:03:42.240> icon<00:03:42.420> or<00:03:43.490> dot<00:03:45.110> lock<00:03:46.110> icon<00:03:46.350> sorry<00:03:47.070> I'm

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
dot item icon or dot lock icon sorry I'm

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.820 
dot item icon or dot lock icon sorry I'm
looking<00:03:47.850> at<00:03:48.180> my<00:03:48.390> reference<00:03:49.110> machine<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.710> I

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
looking at my reference machine and I

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.600 
looking at my reference machine and I
have<00:03:50.070> code<00:03:50.430> for<00:03:50.670> an<00:03:50.880> item<00:03:51.860> but<00:03:52.860> it's<00:03:53.010> basically

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
have code for an item but it's basically

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.730 
have code for an item but it's basically
the<00:03:53.940> same<00:03:54.210> so<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.660> dot<00:03:54.870> block<00:03:55.080> icon<00:03:55.440> block

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
the same so this dot block icon block

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.290 
the same so this dot block icon block
icon<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:58.040> variable<00:03:59.040> declared<00:03:59.310> in<00:03:59.760> our<00:03:59.910> block

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
icon is a variable declared in our block

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.170 
icon is a variable declared in our block
in<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.840> block<00:04:01.110> class<00:04:01.380> not<00:04:02.280> our<00:04:02.550> block<00:04:02.940> class

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
in the block class not our block class

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.560 
in the block class not our block class
and<00:04:03.570> then<00:04:04.530> we're<00:04:04.650> going<00:04:04.770> to<00:04:04.860> say<00:04:05.070> equals<00:04:05.580> reg

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
and then we're going to say equals reg

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.610 
and then we're going to say equals reg
dot<00:04:07.460> register<00:04:08.460> icon<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.120> we're<00:04:10.110> going<00:04:10.320> to<00:04:10.380> say

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
dot register icon and we're going to say

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.880 
dot register icon and we're going to say
texture<00:04:11.430> name<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:12.890> actually<00:04:13.890> we<00:04:14.070> have<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.880> say

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
texture name and actually we have to say

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.039 
texture name and actually we have to say
tutorial<00:04:16.890> dot<00:04:17.549> dot<00:04:18.200> ID<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:20.180> then<00:04:21.180> we're<00:04:21.390> yeah

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
tutorial dot dot ID and then we're yeah

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
I messed up a little bit we're going to

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.220 
I messed up a little bit we're going to
say<00:04:27.300> tutorial<00:04:28.140> not<00:04:29.130> ID<00:04:29.540> plus<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:30.870> then<00:04:31.080> in

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
say tutorial not ID plus and then in

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.800 
say tutorial not ID plus and then in
parentheses<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:32.040> colon<00:04:32.850> plus<00:04:34.310> text<00:04:35.310> your<00:04:35.490> name

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
parentheses a colon plus text your name

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.810 
parentheses a colon plus text your name
now<00:04:36.810> what<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.800> going<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.100> do<00:04:38.220> is<00:04:38.430> it's

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
now what this is going to do is it's

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.610 
now what this is going to do is it's
going<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.510> give<00:04:39.630> us<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.900> string<00:04:40.200> that<00:04:40.380> looks

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
going to give us a string that looks

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.060 
going to give us a string that looks
something<00:04:40.890> like<00:04:41.100> this<00:04:41.660> tutorial<00:04:42.660> mod<00:04:43.140> colon

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
something like this tutorial mod colon

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.320 
something like this tutorial mod colon
and<00:04:44.310> then<00:04:45.920> what's<00:04:46.920> it<00:04:47.040> called<00:04:47.250> block<00:04:47.610> tutorial

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
and then what's it called block tutorial

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.710 
and then what's it called block tutorial
dot<00:04:49.050> B<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:49.620> G<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:50.580> dot<00:04:50.790> PNG<00:04:51.060> is<00:04:51.330> added

knows<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:02.340> look<00:05:02.370> inside<00:05:02.700> of<00:05:03.030> textures<00:05:03.600> blocks

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
knows to look inside of textures blocks

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.190 
knows to look inside of textures blocks
and<00:05:04.770> then<00:05:05.580> it's<00:05:05.760> going<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.090> look<00:05:06.240> for<00:05:06.570> block

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
and then it's going to look for block

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.620 
and then it's going to look for block

to save this dot get unloading and the

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.590 
to save this dot get unloading and the
one<00:06:29.950> issue<00:06:30.100> the<00:06:30.580> one<00:06:30.730> issue<00:06:30.910> I<00:06:31.090> have<00:06:31.360> with<00:06:31.390> this

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
one issue the one issue I have with this

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.930 
one issue the one issue I have with this
is<00:06:31.930> that<00:06:32.050> then<00:06:32.950> you<00:06:33.160> have<00:06:33.310> to<00:06:33.460> go<00:06:33.580> in<00:06:33.700> here<00:06:33.910> and

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
is that then you have to go in here and

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.720 
is that then you have to go in here and
say<00:06:34.240> tile<00:06:34.600> dot<00:06:35.200> block<00:06:35.620> tutorial<00:06:36.160> PNG

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
say tile dot block tutorial PNG

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.290 
say tile dot block tutorial PNG
otherwise<00:06:37.450> it<00:06:37.810> just<00:06:37.840> won't<00:06:38.560> register<00:06:39.300> your

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
otherwise it just won't register your

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.970 
otherwise it just won't register your
texture<00:06:40.810> I<00:06:40.840> don't<00:06:41.110> think<00:06:41.290> it'll<00:06:41.410> crush<00:06:41.710> the

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 
texture I don't think it'll crush the

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.640 
texture I don't think it'll crush the
game<00:06:42.160> but<00:06:42.460> you<00:06:43.300> know<00:06:43.419> you'll<00:06:43.690> get<00:06:43.840> errors<00:06:44.380> and

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
game but you know you'll get errors and

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.520 
game but you know you'll get errors and
your<00:06:45.490> texture<00:06:45.910> will<00:06:46.030> be<00:06:46.180> all<00:06:46.390> pink<00:06:47.260> or

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
your texture will be all pink or

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.190
