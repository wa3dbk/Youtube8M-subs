00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello gentlemen today we are 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.020
 let's talk on the topic of aggression on the topic 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.120
 irritability side of other people 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.670
 why do we have other people annoying and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.990
 how to get rid of this one i take from 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.400
 possible solutions to the problem 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.210
 there is such a saying in another's eye 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.519
 mote you notice your log you do not see 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:30.300
 so this is the key to solving the problem 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.910
 let 's look at my example I go 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.620
 I engaged in the gym getting from 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.989
 this pleasure is one of my days 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.969
 the pleasure began quietly spoils 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.460
 because some kind of eric face is 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:47.100
 a group of people did not clean their pants or 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.899
 at least didn't refuse their wool for 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.309
 so that they do not interfere with anyone left 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.149
 almost in the center of the hall 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.660
 that I was terribly annoying and so are you on 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.809
 pity probably the second week and then later 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.979
 one of the days came up to me and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.979
 said why don't you clean it yourself 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:18.520
 and I didnâ€™t clean up after myself 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.710
 there is a special simulator 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.630
 system so that when man 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.490
 reaches maximum when it is already more 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.030
 add weight can not be specifically 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:32.080
 puts such a hook on him hang 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.880
 pancakes with weight I left this mechanism and 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.630
 I did not clean it further than me 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.630
 it dawned i mean i don't understand myself 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.250
 cleaned up after herself yes she katil others 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.229
 a barrel head here this I as soon as I do it 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.090
 started tracking as soon as i started with 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.910

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.020
