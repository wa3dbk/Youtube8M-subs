now it's time to put all of these things

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.170 
now it's time to put all of these things
together<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.680> check<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.430> out<00:00:20.550> how<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.970> looks

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
together and check it out how it looks

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:34.280 
together and check it out how it looks
and<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.570> Red<00:00:21.840> Hulk<00:00:22.109> MS<00:00:22.680> mode<00:00:32.809> when<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> Titus

and it's Red Hulk MS mode when the Titus
is<00:00:34.410> all<00:00:34.500> put<00:00:34.739> together<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.250> haven't<00:00:35.550> done

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
really any attempt here to try to make

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.930 
really any attempt here to try to make
it<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.530> cool<00:00:37.739> pose<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.579> pretty<00:00:38.760> much

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
it a cool pose it's just a pretty much

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.910 
it a cool pose it's just a pretty much
straight<00:00:39.239> standing<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:39.809> I'm<00:00:40.379> gonna<00:00:40.590> say<00:00:40.770> that

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
straight standing one I'm gonna say that

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.590 
straight standing one I'm gonna say that
it<00:00:41.010> looks<00:00:41.190> pretty<00:00:41.489> good<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.090> terms<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
it looks pretty good in terms of the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.240 
it looks pretty good in terms of the
proportions<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.440> they<00:00:43.500> did<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> great<00:00:43.950> job

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
proportions I think they did a great job

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.459 
proportions I think they did a great job
it<00:00:44.760> certainly<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.329> master<00:00:45.750> great<00:00:45.989> sort<00:00:46.350> of

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it certainly is master great sort of

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.410 
it certainly is master great sort of
sleekness<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.579> that's<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> right<00:00:48.090> word<00:00:48.270> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
sleekness if that's the right word to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.360 
sleekness if that's the right word to
describe<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.950> terms<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.250> overall

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
describe it just in terms of overall

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.069 
describe it just in terms of overall
height<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:50.969> certainly<00:00:51.210> not<00:00:51.390> blocky<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.989> way

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
height it's certainly not blocky the way

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.619 
height it's certainly not blocky the way
a<00:00:52.110> 1/100<00:00:52.800> non-grade<00:00:53.280> would<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.329> overall

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
a 1/100 non-grade would be but overall

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.209 
a 1/100 non-grade would be but overall
you<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.050> gonna<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> size<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you are gonna get the size of the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.279 
you are gonna get the size of the
impression<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> limbs<00:00:57.180> anyway<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
impression of the limbs anyway that the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.569 
impression of the limbs anyway that the
legs<00:00:58.500> are<00:00:58.620> gonna<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.890> bigger<00:00:59.100> than<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> arms

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
legs are gonna be bigger than the arms

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.709 
legs are gonna be bigger than the arms
are<00:00:59.640> gonna<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.940> big<00:01:00.090> especially<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.690> there

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
are gonna be big especially up there

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.689 
are gonna be big especially up there
with<00:01:01.079> those<00:01:01.230> big<00:01:01.500> cartoony<00:01:01.949> shoulders<00:01:02.399> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
with those big cartoony shoulders and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.429 
with those big cartoony shoulders and
hands<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.629> gonna<00:01:03.930> say<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.409> really

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
hands I'm gonna say that they really

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440 
hands I'm gonna say that they really
nailed<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.189> terms<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.580> proportions<00:01:06.090> here

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
nailed it in terms of proportions here

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.410 
nailed it in terms of proportions here
from<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.930> terms<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.380> looks<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.270> are<00:01:09.330> we

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
from in terms of looks so what are we

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
from in terms of looks so what are we
gonna<00:01:09.540> see<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.869> terms<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.229> articulation<00:01:10.950> well

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
gonna see in terms of articulation well

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.530

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
for the lower body if you pop these

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.780 
for the lower body if you pop these
skirts<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.170> which<00:01:13.409> are<00:01:13.590> independence<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.610> can

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
90 degree kick there this is also going

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.999 
90 degree kick there this is also going
to<00:01:18.720> apply<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.290> want<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.500> go<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.860> old

focus of the attention in the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.899 
focus of the attention in the
engineering<00:01:31.530> stages<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.189> that's<00:01:32.640> really

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
engineering stages and that's really

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.340 
engineering stages and that's really
where<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> should<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.840> rotate<00:01:34.079> the

these<00:01:36.329> shoulders<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.840> actually<00:01:37.259> pump

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
these shoulders you can actually pump

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.200 
these shoulders you can actually pump
them<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:38.040> there<00:01:38.430> they've<00:01:38.640> got<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.939> great

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
them out there they've got that great

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.120 
them out there they've got that great
part<00:01:39.479> there<00:01:39.659> that's<00:01:39.869> gonna<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.200> down<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.979> can

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
part there that's gonna go down you can

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.499 
part there that's gonna go down you can
plug<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.970> are<00:01:42.119> still<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
plug that in but you are still going to

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
plug that in but you are still going to
be<00:01:42.600> able<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> move<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> red<00:01:43.439> parts<00:01:43.740> there<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
be able to move the red parts there you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.550 
be able to move the red parts there you
can<00:01:44.670> also<00:01:44.820> move<00:01:45.119> these<00:01:45.420> red<00:01:45.720> parts<00:01:46.079> here<00:01:46.380> which

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
can also move these red parts here which

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.100 
can also move these red parts here which
are<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.040> actually<00:01:47.460> move<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> arm<00:01:48.180> well

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
are going to actually move the arm well

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
are going to actually move the arm well
without<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> actually<00:01:49.680> popping<00:01:50.399> off<00:01:50.640> there

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
without it actually popping off there

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.630 
without it actually popping off there
but<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.259> move<00:01:52.500> these<00:01:52.680> red<00:01:52.979> parts<00:01:53.340> here<00:01:53.520> if

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
but you can move these red parts here if

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.039 
but you can move these red parts here if
you<00:01:53.729> notice<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.270> part<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.930> be

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
you notice that this part is going to be

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.649 
you notice that this part is going to be
moving<00:01:55.259> inside<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.399> gray<00:01:56.790> inner<00:01:57.060> frame<00:01:57.390> from

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
moving inside this gray inner frame from

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.660 
moving inside this gray inner frame from
that<00:01:57.780> outer<00:01:57.990> part<00:01:58.380> which<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.040> very<00:01:59.219> very

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that outer part which is very very

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
that outer part which is very very
impressive<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.450> should<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> great

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
impressive so you should have a great

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.929 
impressive so you should have a great
range<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.860> mobility<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.729> pop

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
range of mobility here if you pop

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.700 
range of mobility here if you pop
everything<00:02:03.479> up<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.229> see<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.560> red

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
everything up you can see that the red

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.319 
everything up you can see that the red
part<00:02:04.920> sort<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.189> dislodged<00:02:05.579> there<00:02:05.939> though<00:02:06.119> so

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
part sort of dislodged there though so

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.130 
part sort of dislodged there though so
that<00:02:06.450> could<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> little<00:02:06.960> bit<00:02:07.079> of

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
that could be a little bit of

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.050 
that could be a little bit of
problematic<00:02:07.500> very<00:02:08.190> easy<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:08.819> in

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
problematic very easy to get back in

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.119 
problematic very easy to get back in
remember<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.170> rotate<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.619> part<00:02:10.830> here

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
remember you can rotate this part here

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.260 
remember you can rotate this part here
the<00:02:11.160> elbow<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.819> give<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> nice

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the elbow is going to give you a nice

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.610 
the elbow is going to give you a nice
135<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.260> those

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
135 and those

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.979 
135 and those
this<00:02:13.830> are<00:02:14.159> going<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.519> rotate<00:02:14.700> around<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.840> that

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
this are going to rotate around so that

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.119 
this are going to rotate around so that
they're<00:02:16.080> gonna<00:02:16.170> look<00:02:16.379> cool<00:02:16.560> no<00:02:16.739> matter<00:02:16.890> which

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
they're gonna look cool no matter which

comparison<00:02:22.200> we'll<00:02:22.739> kick<00:02:22.890> things<00:02:22.920> right<00:02:23.310> off

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
comparison we'll kick things right off

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.039 
comparison we'll kick things right off
with<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.700> little<00:02:23.970> bit<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.209> shocker<00:02:24.480> here<00:02:24.810> but

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
with a little bit of a shocker here but

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.479 
with a little bit of a shocker here but
just<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.409> terms<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.890> guy<00:02:26.040> should<00:02:26.340> be<00:02:26.459> a

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.830 
inevitable inevitable master grade which
hopefully<00:03:02.670> isn't<00:03:03.030> going<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.209> be<00:03:03.329> too<00:03:03.359> far<00:03:03.720> away

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.660 
hopefully isn't going to be too far away
in<00:03:04.319> terms<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:05.010> height<00:03:05.159> though<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.430> can<00:03:05.579> see

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
in terms of height though you can see

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.979 
in terms of height though you can see
that<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.909> tightest<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.299> gonna<00:03:06.510> be<00:03:06.629> smaller

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
that the tightest is gonna be smaller

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.569 
that the tightest is gonna be smaller
and<00:03:07.409> he's<00:03:07.739> certainly<00:03:07.890> not<00:03:08.190> gonna<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.489> the

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
and he's certainly not gonna have the

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.220 
and he's certainly not gonna have the
same<00:03:08.730> wingspan<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.239> this<00:03:09.510> guy<00:03:09.659> gets<00:03:09.900> thanks

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
same wingspan that this guy gets thanks

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.420 
same wingspan that this guy gets thanks
to<00:03:10.319> those<00:03:10.440> things<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.859> are<00:03:10.950> just<00:03:11.069> flopping

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
to those things that are just flopping

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.940 
to those things that are just flopping
off<00:03:11.670> his<00:03:11.879> shoulders<00:03:12.269> there<00:03:12.540> but<00:03:13.379> finally<00:03:13.799> -

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
off his shoulders there but finally -

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.410 
off his shoulders there but finally -
like<00:03:14.129> with<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.609> and<00:03:14.849> these<00:03:14.940> are<00:03:15.150> very

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
like with the like and these are very

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.270 
like with the like and these are very
alike<00:03:15.780> here<00:03:16.049> with<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.319> h1<00:03:16.680> normal<00:03:17.040> on<00:03:17.190> the

alike here with the h1 normal on the
right<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.880> also<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.239> master<00:03:18.540> grade

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
right this is also the master grade

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.180 
right this is also the master grade
which<00:03:18.870> came<00:03:19.049> on<00:03:19.169> a<00:03:19.200> month<00:03:19.410> earlier<00:03:19.859> than<00:03:19.919> the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
which came on a month earlier than the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.460 
which came on a month earlier than the
tightest<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:21.209> can<00:03:21.389> see<00:03:21.540> here<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.930> with<00:03:22.349> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
tightest you can see here that with the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.020 
tightest you can see here that with the
high<00:03:22.620> grades<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.130> actually<00:03:23.430> had<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.579> fair<00:03:23.880> bit

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
high grades you actually had a fair bit

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.339 
high grades you actually had a fair bit
of<00:03:24.120> height<00:03:24.299> difference<00:03:24.630> between<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.169> h1

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
of height difference between the h1

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.170 
of height difference between the h1
normal<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.040> tightest<00:03:26.370> whereas<00:03:27.000> with

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
normal and the tightest whereas with

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.789 
normal and the tightest whereas with
this<00:03:27.299> one<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.540> just<00:03:27.870> say<00:03:27.989> it's<00:03:28.139> about<00:03:28.410> half<00:03:28.680> a

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
this one I just say it's about half a

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:29.990 
this one I just say it's about half a
centimeter<00:03:29.190> you're<00:03:29.370> not<00:03:29.459> gonna<00:03:29.579> have<00:03:29.790> all

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
centimeter you're not gonna have all

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.250 
centimeter you're not gonna have all
that<00:03:30.030> big<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.480> difference<00:03:30.690> there

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
that big a difference there

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.170 
that big a difference there
you<00:03:31.680> certainly<00:03:31.919> are<00:03:32.250> going<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.579> have<00:03:32.760> more<00:03:33.030> of

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
you certainly are going to have more of

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.390 
you certainly are going to have more of
an<00:03:33.269> rx-78<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.319> sleek<00:03:34.769> look<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.099> this

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
an rx-78 to sleek look to this

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.770 
an rx-78 to sleek look to this
especially<00:03:35.790> just<00:03:36.060> with<00:03:36.269> more<00:03:36.450> some<00:03:36.629> of<00:03:36.720> the

especially just with more some of the

tightest<00:03:40.859> you<00:03:40.980> are<00:03:41.129> gonna<00:03:41.280> have<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.639> overall

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
tightest you are gonna have the overall

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.789 
tightest you are gonna have the overall
speed<00:03:42.449> or<00:03:42.750> it's<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:43.169> gonna<00:03:43.290> look<00:03:43.470> bigger<00:03:43.650> and

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
speed or it's just gonna look bigger and

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.849 
speed or it's just gonna look bigger and
bulkier<00:03:44.040> if<00:03:44.639> not<00:03:45.030> speedier<00:03:45.480> though<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:46.319> for

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
bulkier if not speedier though the for

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.259 
bulkier if not speedier though the for
whatever<00:03:47.010> reason<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.579> just<00:03:47.760> seems<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:48.000> the

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
whatever reason it just seems like the

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.150 
whatever reason it just seems like the
fins<00:03:48.629> there<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.199> race<00:03:49.349> car<00:03:49.590> spoiler<00:03:49.949> on<00:03:50.069> the

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
fins there the race car spoiler on the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.349 
fins there the race car spoiler on the
back<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.489> just<00:03:50.519> gonna<00:03:50.790> stand<00:03:51.000> out<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.209> little

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
back is just gonna stand out a little

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.059 
back is just gonna stand out a little
bit<00:03:51.510> more<00:03:51.810> probably<00:03:52.230> because<00:03:52.739> it's<00:03:52.919> just

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
bit more probably because it's just

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.220 
bit more probably because it's just
offset<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.669> with<00:03:53.879> red<00:03:54.090> but<00:03:54.750> overall<00:03:54.989> I've

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
offset there with red but overall I've

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.300 
offset there with red but overall I've
got<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:55.470> say<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.829> tightest<00:03:56.160> is

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
got to say that the tightest is

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.800 
got to say that the tightest is
certainly<00:03:56.639> very<00:03:56.910> cool<00:03:57.269> in<00:03:57.449> terms<00:03:57.660> of

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
certainly very cool in terms of

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.300 
certainly very cool in terms of
proportions<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.470> it's<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.650> nice<00:03:58.829> addition<00:03:59.010> to

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
proportions and it's a nice addition to

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.110 
proportions and it's a nice addition to
the<00:03:59.549> aged<00:03:59.760> one<00:04:00.150> family

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.380 

in<00:04:07.920> terms<00:04:08.920> of<00:04:09.069> posing<00:04:09.550> this<00:04:09.730> guy<00:04:09.940> believe<00:04:10.300> it

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
in terms of posing this guy believe it

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.460 
in terms of posing this guy believe it
or<00:04:10.480> not<00:04:10.569> is<00:04:10.690> probably<00:04:10.780> gonna<00:04:11.080> take<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.260> little

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
or not is probably gonna take a little

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.930 
or not is probably gonna take a little
bit<00:04:11.680> of<00:04:11.770> patience<00:04:12.160> if<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.430> really<00:04:12.700> want<00:04:12.880> to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
bit of patience if you really want to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.910 
bit of patience if you really want to
show<00:04:13.120> off<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:13.540> muscle<00:04:13.930> man<00:04:14.110> poses<00:04:14.620> so<00:04:14.770> if<00:04:14.830> you

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
show off the muscle man poses so if you

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.140 
show off the muscle man poses so if you
want<00:04:15.069> to<00:04:15.099> get<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.340> Schwarzenegger<00:04:15.819> here

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
want to get the Schwarzenegger here

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.640 
want to get the Schwarzenegger here
you're<00:04:16.630> gonna<00:04:16.750> have<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.049> get<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.260> legs<00:04:17.440> and

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
you're gonna have to get the legs and

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.810 
you're gonna have to get the legs and
the<00:04:17.739> hips<00:04:17.769> and<00:04:18.100> everything<00:04:18.400> lined<00:04:18.639> up<00:04:18.790> just

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
the hips and everything lined up just

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.729 
the hips and everything lined up just
right<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.660> those<00:04:19.780> shoulders<00:04:20.230> again<00:04:20.440> with<00:04:20.590> all

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
that articulation you can move them

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.700 
that articulation you can move them
around<00:04:22.180> all<00:04:22.510> over<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.900> place<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.380> this<00:04:23.530> was

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
around all over the place and this was

Street Fighter 4 it looks like a
spinning<00:04:25.180> pile<00:04:25.510> driver<00:04:25.540> would<00:04:26.169> be<00:04:26.200> incoming

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
spinning pile driver would be incoming

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.530

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
here the grappling hands are actually

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.180 
here the grappling hands are actually
gonna<00:04:28.780> look<00:04:28.960> pretty<00:04:29.260> good<00:04:29.620> better<00:04:29.980> than<00:04:30.130> I

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
gonna look pretty good better than I

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.760 
gonna look pretty good better than I

by not having the articulation no doubt
about<00:04:34.450> that<00:04:34.570> but<00:04:34.930> they<00:04:35.020> are<00:04:35.169> in<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.530> pretty<00:04:35.800> good

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
about that but they are in a pretty good

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.129 
about that but they are in a pretty good

that point to articulation is going to

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.950 
that point to articulation is going to
be<00:04:39.520> pretty<00:04:39.700> good<00:04:39.790> it's<00:04:40.419> gonna<00:04:40.540> take<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.780> little

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
be pretty good it's gonna take a little

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.510 
be pretty good it's gonna take a little
bit<00:04:41.139> of<00:04:41.200> tweaking<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.950> shoulders<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.430> get

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
bit of tweaking the shoulders to get

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.680 
bit of tweaking the shoulders to get
them<00:04:42.669> around<00:04:42.910> because<00:04:43.180> you're<00:04:43.270> gonna<00:04:43.389> have<00:04:43.600> to

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
them around because you're gonna have to

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.480 
them around because you're gonna have to
sort<00:04:43.900> of<00:04:43.990> pull<00:04:44.200> them<00:04:44.350> out<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.530> get<00:04:44.770> them<00:04:44.950> to

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
sort of pull them out to get them to

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.310 
sort of pull them out to get them to
rotate<00:04:45.729> forward<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.510> back<00:04:46.660> just<00:04:46.960> because<00:04:47.229> of

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
rotate forward and back just because of

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.629 
rotate forward and back just because of
the<00:04:47.410> way<00:04:47.500> that<00:04:47.650> they<00:04:47.800> can<00:04:48.010> get<00:04:48.190> locked<00:04:48.400> in

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
the way that they can get locked in

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.060 
the way that they can get locked in
there<00:04:48.880> but<00:04:49.540> overall<00:04:49.840> even<00:04:50.290> in<00:04:50.410> just<00:04:50.560> a<00:04:50.710> simple

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
there but overall even in just a simple

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.409 
there but overall even in just a simple
post<00:04:51.250> like<00:04:51.430> this<00:04:51.610> this<00:04:51.790> guy<00:04:51.940> is<00:04:52.000> gonna<00:04:52.210> have<00:04:52.389> a

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
post like this this guy is gonna have a

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.450 
post like this this guy is gonna have a
pretty<00:04:52.720> cool<00:04:52.930> place<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.440> think<00:04:53.650> on<00:04:53.889> your<00:04:54.160> shelf

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
pretty cool place I think on your shelf

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.010 
pretty cool place I think on your shelf
and<00:04:54.639> certainly<00:04:54.970> one<00:04:55.180> of<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.330> more<00:04:55.419> unique<00:04:55.630> get

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
and certainly one of the more unique get

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.590 
and certainly one of the more unique get
nums<00:04:56.229> out<00:04:56.410> there<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:57.010> while<00:04:57.880> this<00:04:58.150> pose<00:04:58.330> could

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
nums out there and while this pose could

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.150 
nums out there and while this pose could
certainly<00:04:58.840> be<00:04:59.080> improved<00:04:59.440> upon<00:04:59.590> with<00:04:59.860> a<00:04:59.889> little

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
certainly be improved upon with a little

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.890 
certainly be improved upon with a little
bit<00:05:00.280> more<00:05:00.430> time<00:05:00.729> this<00:05:01.150> is<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.419> kind<00:05:01.630> of<00:05:01.720> thing

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
bit more time this is the kind of thing

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.300 
bit more time this is the kind of thing
that<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.110> master<00:05:02.470> great<00:05:02.650> ground<00:05:02.950> kind<00:05:03.220> of

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
that the master great ground kind of

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.210 
that the master great ground kind of
advertised<00:05:03.970> almost<00:05:04.870> a<00:05:04.960> decade<00:05:05.139> ago<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.830> yet

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
advertised almost a decade ago and yet

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.190 
advertised almost a decade ago and yet
this<00:05:06.490> guy<00:05:06.729> pulls<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.150> off<00:05:07.270> with<00:05:07.540> very<00:05:07.870> very

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
this guy pulls it off with very very

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.830 
this guy pulls it off with very very
little<00:05:08.440> effort<00:05:08.680> needed<00:05:09.310> on<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.760> part<00:05:10.000> of<00:05:10.240> the

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
little effort needed on the part of the

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.659 
little effort needed on the part of the
person<00:05:11.260> posing<00:05:11.650> up<00:05:11.770> I<00:05:11.950> gotta<00:05:12.310> say<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.610> he

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
person posing up I gotta say that he

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:13.950 
person posing up I gotta say that he
looks<00:05:12.789> pretty<00:05:13.060> cool<00:05:13.210> these<00:05:13.419> hands<00:05:13.840> are

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
looks pretty cool these hands are

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.210 
looks pretty cool these hands are
certainly<00:05:14.200> growing<00:05:14.470> on<00:05:14.680> me<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:14.919> it's<00:05:15.010> nice<00:05:15.160> to

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
certainly growing on me and it's nice to

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.980 
certainly growing on me and it's nice to
have<00:05:15.490> those<00:05:15.640> variations<00:05:16.000> instead<00:05:16.660> of<00:05:16.750> just

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
have those variations instead of just

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.830 
have those variations instead of just
the<00:05:17.080> old<00:05:17.229> closed<00:05:17.590> fist<00:05:21.539> but<00:05:22.539> then<00:05:22.720> again

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
the old closed fist but then again

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.140 
the old closed fist but then again
sometimes<00:05:23.500> you<00:05:23.800> do<00:05:24.039> just<00:05:24.310> need<00:05:24.460> fists<00:05:25.030> of

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
sometimes you do just need fists of

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.480 
sometimes you do just need fists of
power<00:05:25.360> in<00:05:25.660> place<00:05:25.900> there<00:05:26.260> for<00:05:26.470> this<00:05:27.100> kind<00:05:27.370> of

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
power in place there for this kind of

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.100 
power in place there for this kind of
shot<00:05:27.669> which<00:05:27.880> is<00:05:27.910> somewhat<00:05:28.390> reminiscent<00:05:28.810> of

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
shot which is somewhat reminiscent of

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.420 
shot which is somewhat reminiscent of
the<00:05:29.200> last<00:05:29.410> shot<00:05:29.680> except<00:05:30.070> for<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.220> fact<00:05:30.340> that

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
the last shot except for the fact that

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.159 
the last shot except for the fact that
he's<00:05:30.610> actually<00:05:30.729> gonna<00:05:31.000> head<00:05:31.270> depending<00:05:32.080> on

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
he's actually gonna head depending on

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.750 
he's actually gonna head depending on
which<00:05:32.320> kind<00:05:32.560> of<00:05:32.650> angle<00:05:32.919> you<00:05:33.039> put<00:05:33.250> your<00:05:33.430> head<00:05:33.580> at

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
which kind of angle you put your head at

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.460 
which kind of angle you put your head at
and<00:05:34.060> your<00:05:34.210> vantage<00:05:34.419> point<00:05:34.900> in<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.140> case<00:05:35.289> of

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
and your vantage point in the case of

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.409 
and your vantage point in the case of
this<00:05:35.590> camera<00:05:35.950> here<00:05:36.190> you<00:05:36.820> can<00:05:36.970> actually<00:05:37.120> have

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
this camera here you can actually have

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.629 
this camera here you can actually have
this<00:05:37.570> guy<00:05:37.750> look<00:05:38.139> not<00:05:38.500> so<00:05:38.530> great<00:05:39.100> straight<00:05:39.460> on

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
this guy look not so great straight on

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.909 
this guy look not so great straight on
but<00:05:40.240> if<00:05:40.360> you<00:05:40.450> do<00:05:40.600> just<00:05:40.840> elevate<00:05:41.590> am<00:05:41.680> ever<00:05:41.830> so

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
but if you do just elevate am ever so

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.560 
but if you do just elevate am ever so
slightly<00:05:42.370> you<00:05:42.610> can<00:05:42.639> actually<00:05:43.060> have<00:05:43.210> a<00:05:43.240> pretty

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
slightly you can actually have a pretty

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.810 
slightly you can actually have a pretty
cool<00:05:43.900> effect<00:05:46.080> and<00:05:47.100> though<00:05:48.100> this<00:05:48.250> may<00:05:48.430> look<00:05:48.639> a

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
cool effect and though this may look a

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.400 
cool effect and though this may look a
little<00:05:49.120> bit<00:05:49.240> awkward<00:05:49.360> as<00:05:49.690> it<00:05:49.810> rotates<00:05:50.020> around

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
little bit awkward as it rotates around

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.810 
little bit awkward as it rotates around
if<00:05:50.740> you<00:05:50.830> were<00:05:50.950> just<00:05:51.130> to<00:05:51.310> set<00:05:51.460> it<00:05:51.490> up<00:05:51.639> in<00:05:51.760> a

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
if you were just to set it up in a

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.820 
if you were just to set it up in a
stationary<00:05:52.360> pose<00:05:52.600> on<00:05:52.810> your<00:05:52.960> shelf<00:05:53.200> it's

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
stationary pose on your shelf it's

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
are doing a good job of getting it

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.360 
are doing a good job of getting it
wherever<00:05:58.450> you<00:05:58.720> want<00:05:58.750> it<00:05:58.990> to<00:05:59.110> go<00:05:59.260> but<00:06:00.010> that<00:06:00.160> beam

wherever you want it to go but that beam

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.800 
wherever you want it to go but that beam
lariat<00:06:00.850> looks<00:06:01.120> like<00:06:01.270> it's<00:06:01.419> going<00:06:01.630> to<00:06:01.660> be

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
lariat looks like it's going to be

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.690 
lariat looks like it's going to be
bringing<00:06:02.050> a<00:06:02.229> whole<00:06:02.470> bunch<00:06:02.800> of<00:06:02.950> pain<00:06:03.190> I<00:06:03.430> just

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
bringing a whole bunch of pain I just

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.100 
bringing a whole bunch of pain I just
probably<00:06:03.940> do<00:06:04.120> a<00:06:04.150> better<00:06:04.330> job<00:06:04.389> of<00:06:04.630> tucking<00:06:04.960> this

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
probably do a better job of tucking this

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.379 
probably do a better job of tucking this
arm<00:06:05.350> back<00:06:05.590> into<00:06:05.860> place<00:06:06.070> but<00:06:06.789> the<00:06:06.970> way<00:06:07.090> you<00:06:07.150> can

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
arm back into place but the way you can

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.120 
arm back into place but the way you can
twist<00:06:07.600> the<00:06:07.780> arms<00:06:08.110> around<00:06:08.440> or<00:06:08.620> those<00:06:08.770> waist

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
twist the arms around or those waist

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.440 
twist the arms around or those waist
around<00:06:09.340> and<00:06:09.639> the<00:06:09.700> way<00:06:09.789> you<00:06:09.850> can<00:06:10.060> do<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.270> whole

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
around and the way you can do the whole

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.510 
around and the way you can do the whole
upper<00:06:10.750> body<00:06:10.780> I'd<00:06:11.470> say<00:06:11.710> that<00:06:11.860> if<00:06:11.979> you<00:06:12.070> freeze<00:06:12.340> it

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
upper body I'd say that if you freeze it

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.210 
upper body I'd say that if you freeze it
about<00:06:12.729> right<00:06:12.940> there<00:06:13.360> that<00:06:13.930> that<00:06:14.229> is<00:06:14.590> a<00:06:14.680> very

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
about right there that that is a very

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.650 
about right there that that is a very
cool<00:06:15.550> and<00:06:15.820> iconic<00:06:16.150> master<00:06:16.930> great<00:06:17.169> pose

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.820 

again<00:06:20.660> you<00:06:20.810> can<00:06:20.930> do<00:06:21.050> all<00:06:21.169> sorts<00:06:21.199> of<00:06:21.500> tricks<00:06:21.710> to

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
again you can do all sorts of tricks to

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.860 
again you can do all sorts of tricks to
get<00:06:22.009> the<00:06:22.100> waste<00:06:22.370> into<00:06:22.639> position<00:06:23.210> but<00:06:23.419> this<00:06:23.600> guy

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
get the waste into position but this guy

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.510 
get the waste into position but this guy
is<00:06:23.930> going<00:06:24.199> to<00:06:24.289> come<00:06:24.500> across<00:06:24.740> as<00:06:25.100> somebody<00:06:25.280> with

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
is going to come across as somebody with

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.290 
is going to come across as somebody with
a<00:06:25.580> lot<00:06:26.000> of<00:06:26.330> rage<00:06:27.080> issues<00:06:27.350> and<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:28.819> ability<00:06:29.270> to
