00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
how to do it but there's a little bitty

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.130 
how to do it but there's a little bitty
box<00:04:01.579> on<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:01.910> pole<00:04:02.120> there<00:04:02.269> you<00:04:02.420> hit<00:04:02.630> that<00:04:02.870> and

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
box on the pole there you hit that and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.280 
box on the pole there you hit that and
you'll<00:04:03.590> see<00:04:03.650> all<00:04:04.040> these<00:04:04.250> drops<00:04:04.549> kind<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.090> like

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
you'll see all these drops kind of like

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.930 
you'll see all these drops kind of like
do<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.320> circular<00:04:06.709> deal<00:04:07.130> like<00:04:07.370> that<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.760> go<00:04:07.820> up

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
do a circular deal like that and go up

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.900 
do a circular deal like that and go up
the<00:04:08.090> pole<00:04:08.299> and<00:04:08.570> then<00:04:08.720> just<00:04:08.989> feel<00:04:09.470> be<00:04:10.400> Gandhi

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
the pole and then just feel be Gandhi

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.600 
the pole and then just feel be Gandhi
but<00:04:11.690> I<00:04:11.750> figured<00:04:12.170> I'd<00:04:12.350> do<00:04:12.620> this<00:04:12.829> maybe<00:04:13.250> that

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
but I figured I'd do this maybe that

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.479 
but I figured I'd do this maybe that
would<00:04:13.940> start<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.769> you<00:04:15.769> know<00:04:15.890> make<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.280> help
