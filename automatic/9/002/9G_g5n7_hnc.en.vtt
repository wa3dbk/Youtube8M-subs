00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.960
 who hits the Chilean of the future president 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.130
 I have listened carefully 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.979
 that the president 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.249
 who is capable of creating good jobs 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:11.869
 canalda labor 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.889
 defeat crime and fear and give people back their right to live 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:16.939
 in peace 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.730
 also be able to solve the serious problem of health 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.999
 and justice 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.619
 that is our mission 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.130
 win that battle 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.130
 and share those triumphs with all Chile 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.789
 senator frei was already president 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.320
 he had his chance 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.980
 and I think he let it go 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.640
 and maybe to help explain why 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.750
 I pardon the greatest drug trafficker that we have had all night 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.530
 I have dedicated the last 20 years make supu 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.340
 I have experience but I have never participated in a goya 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.540
 if I have the privilege 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.600
 to serve him as president 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.050
 I'm going to be a president of change and national unity 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.830
 I established the culture to do things well 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.880
 and honestly 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.550
 and have always in the heart 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.610
 to the poorest and to the middle class our country 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.800
 that's why tonight I want to summon them 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.030
 with food and hope 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.390
 let's build for all but especially for our children 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.960
 a homeland 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.100
 in which we can live as brothers 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.410
 with justice in peace with opportunities and with joy 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.250
 and I'm sure 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.020
 that with the help of god 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.370
 together we test the works 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.060
 well we want chip 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.340
 I tell you from the bottom of my heart many thanks to the vest and negative in 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.340
 the nights 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 January first 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.770
 I want to be president 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.530
 to build a chile 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.840
 where there is full democracy 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.460
 more freedom 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.410
 and social justice 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.479
 I want to be clear 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.219
 and respectful 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:13.059
 I feel that my candidacy 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.159
 make a difference 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.159
 with the candidates of miter electoral opponents 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:20.329
 fast 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.340
 and raises 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.129
 an extreme decision 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.249
 to the free market model 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:30.949
 and I think eduardo and marca show too much respect for the market and its 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.459
 powers 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.619
 I see 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.029
 the world as a socialist 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:37.899
 as a libertarian 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.289
 like a hall in dispute 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.319
 as a man for a judgment are left minds 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.119
 and mine from the perspective of democracy 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:47.889
 and equality 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.370
 and he looked there 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.659
 the courses to build 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.129
 a nation 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.919
 who does not stop commented 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.789
 not to be segmented 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:59.729
 a nation that this one unit 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.379
 chile de chile 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.999
 Chile of Chileans 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.520
 outside of Chile 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.080
 the chile all 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.190
 the homeland for all of us who promised the 88 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.639
 and the 89 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.519
 cast 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.580
 it's what I want 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.580
 build being president of chile 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.479
 to deal with the Greek debt 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.479
 to mark enrÃ­quez-ominami 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:36.929
 I would like first to thank the interests of Chileans and 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:39.249
 between are residential 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.039
 stress that television 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.089
 not only about me 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.009

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.179
 something unprecedented history of chile and everything we feel part duch indicate 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.119
 I think 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:56.329
 of what it is now about to continue changing Chile 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.459
 in fact and poet sacrifice everything 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.459
 despite it 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.870
 bad will some couples in the primaries of the few desire some for 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.259
 that there is more democracy 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.279
 let's continue to win here we have seen a few minutes ago 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.939
 abdo garter of the past one that already had his chance 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.030

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.329
 fp and the isaps 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.569
 Two men who pretend not to listen 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.259
 I think I know what was asked 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.770
 How do you ask how they respond where 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.580
 when asked they wanted to respond 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.469
 to the other side what one of them explains, we talk to you with the truth 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.379
