Hi, I'm Jonathan Bird and welcome to my world!

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.050
The sea snake is an animal surrounded in mystery—known
for its incredibly powerful venom, but not

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.550
much else. Just how dangerous are these marine
reptiles?

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.550
I have traveled to Queensland, Australia on
a quest to learn about sea snakes.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.440
Here on Australia's Great Barrier Reef,
sea snakes are fairly common. Lets go see

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.440
if we can find one.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.090
I hit the water, grab my camera and head towards
the sea floor.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.460
Today I'm diving on a little seamount called
a coral Bommie. It's a mini-mountain of

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.500
coral sticking up from the bottom, but not
quite reaching the surface.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.190
Near the top of the Bommie, thousands of small
fish feed on plankton passing by in the current,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.100
but they stay close to the reef, because they
are being watched by a big school of jacks

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.100
who are on the prowl for food themselves.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.190
The bommie is covered in healthy coral that
provides lots of nooks and crannies for the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.190
fish to hide if they need cover.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.659
On the other side of the bommie, a large school
of snappers are also looking for something

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:15.659
to eat, and keeping a safe distance from the
jacks.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.920
As I swim along at the base of the bommie,
I'm keeping my eyes open for a snake-like

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.310
animal. The coral looks healthy and a Spinecheek
anemonefish gives me a quick glance from the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.450
safety of her host anemone.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.890
But I keep scanning the bottom and at last
I have found my quarry: an olive sea snake,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.230
the most common species around the Great Barrier
Reef. It's swimming along the bottom doing

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.750
the same thing everything else is doing—looking
for food. The sea snake is closely related

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.489
to a land snake, except it has adapted for
life underwater.

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.209
When a sea snake flicks its tongue, it's
getting rid of excess salt secreted by special

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.330
glands in its mouth. Sea snakes live exclusively
in the ocean, but since they're reptiles,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.250
their kidneys can't deal with too much excess
salt in their blood.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.770
A sea snake gets around with a flattened section
of tail that looks like an oar and serves

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.520
as a fin. It looks just like an eel when it
swims, undulating its body and getting propulsion

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.239
from that flattened tail.

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.500
Although sea snakes prefer to eat fish, eels
and shrimp, these snappers aren't at all

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.500
afraid of the sea snake, because they are
way too big for the sea snake to bite.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.930
This snake is heading for the surface to grab
a breath of air. A sea snake, just like a

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.750
land snake, has lungs and must breathe air
to survive. It can hold its breath up to 3

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.519
hours during a dive. Recent research has shown
that some sea snakes also can absorb a little

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.480
bit of oxygen directly from the water through
their skin, which is probably why a breath

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.480
can last so long.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.650
After spending a minute at the surface breathing,
the sea snake comes back down to the bottom.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.970
It's poking around, looking for holes where
it might corner a fish or shrimp. It sticks

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
its head into the holes, hoping to get lucky.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.800
The sea snake is most closely related to the
Cobra on land, and its venom is quite similar

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.210
to cobra venom, but considerably more potent.
If it manages to grab a fish, the venom will

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:11.210
kill it in seconds.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.270
Sea snakes quite often take a rest on the
bottom, sleeping as they hold their breath.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:24.270
I use the opportunity to sneak up on one.
In spite of their fearsome venom, sea snakes

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.500
are very timid and not particularly aggressive.
Although this one is obviously not thrilled

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:40.389
about being picked up, it doesn't try to
bite me. And when I let go, it just swims

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.790
away.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:01.790
I find another one and can't resist the
opportunity to show the flattened tail section.

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:10.389
Swim, be free!

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:17.389
Although the 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.460
sea snake is one of the most venomous animals
in the world, you're not very likely to

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.340
be bitten by one. And the reason is, they
just can't open their mouths very wid. In

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.320
fact they would have a hard time getting the
tip of my finger into their mouths. In fact

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.160
the only place you could be bitten by a sea
snake is on the think little fold of skin

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.870
between your fingers, or maybe on your lip.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.740
There are 62 known species of sea snakes and
they live all around the tropical Indo-Pacific.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:57.009
I found this banded sea snake in the Philippines.
They like nice warm tropical water because

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:03.139
they are cold-blooded, like all reptiles.
If the water gets too cold, they get lethargic.

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:08.900
So, no matter what you might think of snakes,
sea snakes are timid and shy animals that

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.729
represent almost no threat at all to people,
even though they produce some of the most

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.550
powerful venom in the world.
