00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.720 
about practicing techniques and pitfalls

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.049 
about practicing techniques and pitfalls
okay<00:00:09.720> my<00:00:10.680> rule<00:00:10.980> with<00:00:11.160> my<00:00:11.309> students<00:00:11.760> is<00:00:11.880> that

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
okay my rule with my students is that

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.669 
okay my rule with my students is that
you<00:00:12.150> practice<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.840> days<00:00:13.050> that<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.380> eat

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
you practice on the days that you eat

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.180 
you practice on the days that you eat
and<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.370> reason<00:00:14.760> I<00:00:14.849> say<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.780> because<00:00:16.770> if

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
and the reason I say that is because if

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.820 
and the reason I say that is because if
you<00:00:17.460> absorb<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.360> little<00:00:18.869> information<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
you absorb a little information on a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.460 
you absorb a little information on a
regular<00:00:19.920> basis<00:00:20.789> it's<00:00:21.720> gonna<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.320> gonna

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
regular basis it's gonna it's gonna

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.710 
regular basis it's gonna it's gonna
benefit<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.369> long<00:00:23.550> run<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.240> much<00:00:24.449> more

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
benefit you in the long run so much more

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.710 
benefit you in the long run so much more
in<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:25.980> opinion<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:26.820> how<00:00:27.180> much<00:00:27.330> time<00:00:27.600> you

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
in my opinion it's not how much time you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.939 
in my opinion it's not how much time you
spend<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.080> not<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.470> got<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.680> spend<00:00:28.890> an

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
spend it's not that you got to spend an

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.679 
spend it's not that you got to spend an
hour<00:00:29.070> or<00:00:29.369> two<00:00:29.550> or<00:00:29.730> three<00:00:29.760> or<00:00:29.939> four<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.269> day<00:00:30.330> it's

hour or two or three or four a day it's

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.469 
hour or two or three or four a day it's
not<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.219> take<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> concept<00:00:33.179> a

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:33.479 
not that it's that you take a concept a

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.759 
not that it's that you take a concept a
little<00:00:34.319> idea<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.429> chip<00:00:35.819> away<00:00:36.030> at<00:00:36.329> it

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
little idea and you chip away at it

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.799 
little idea and you chip away at it
constantly<00:00:37.769> every<00:00:38.489> day<00:00:38.639> maybe<00:00:39.389> you<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.600> five

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
constantly every day maybe you do five

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.329 
constantly every day maybe you do five
ten<00:00:40.019> minutes<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:40.499> five<00:00:40.739> ten<00:00:40.979> minutes<00:00:41.010> here

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
ten minutes here five ten minutes here

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.950 
ten minutes here five ten minutes here
in<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.489> day<00:00:41.639> or<00:00:41.789> whatever<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.780> keep

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
in a day or whatever but you keep

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.719 
in a day or whatever but you keep
chipping<00:00:43.170> away<00:00:43.409> at<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.679> concept<00:00:44.249> until<00:00:44.609> you

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
chipping away at that concept until you

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:48.709 
chipping away at that concept until you
fully<00:00:45.440> understand<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> concept<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:48.539> don't

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
fully understand the concept you don't

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.209 
fully understand the concept you don't
just<00:00:48.899> keep<00:00:49.079> grabbing<00:00:49.530> different<00:00:50.039> things

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
just keep grabbing different things

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
just keep grabbing different things
because<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.670> happens<00:00:50.999> is<00:00:51.179> and<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.659> may<00:00:51.809> have

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
because what happens is and you may have

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.109 
because what happens is and you may have
been<00:00:51.959> here<00:00:52.260> before<00:00:52.459> you'll<00:00:53.459> kind<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.850> learn<00:00:53.969> an

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:54.119 
been here before you'll kind of learn an

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:55.459 
been here before you'll kind of learn an
idea<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.719> move<00:00:54.839> on<00:00:54.959> to<00:00:55.109> another<00:00:55.139> idea

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
idea then you move on to another idea

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.289 
idea then you move on to another idea
and<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.100> completely<00:00:56.459> forget<00:00:56.549> the<00:00:56.879> idea<00:00:56.999> you

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:57.299 
and you completely forget the idea you

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:58.579 
and you completely forget the idea you
were<00:00:57.389> working<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.749> in<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.959> first<00:00:58.139> place<00:00:58.409> now

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
were working on in the first place now

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.439 
were working on in the first place now
you're<00:00:58.709> onto<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.039> idea<00:00:59.249> and<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.639> just<00:01:00.239> kind

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
you're onto this idea and you just kind

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.519 
you're onto this idea and you just kind
of<00:01:00.510> bounce<00:01:00.719> around<00:01:00.869> and<00:01:01.170> that's<00:01:01.319> why

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:01.529 
of bounce around and that's why

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:04.310 
of bounce around and that's why
unfortunately<00:01:02.279> a<00:01:02.459> lot<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.969> things<00:01:03.179> like<00:01:03.449> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
unfortunately a lot of things like you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.899 
unfortunately a lot of things like you
know<00:01:04.439> YouTube<00:01:04.859> or<00:01:05.250> different<00:01:05.729> things<00:01:05.789> like

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
know YouTube or different things like

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.520 
know YouTube or different things like
that<00:01:06.060> don't<00:01:06.180> work<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:07.079> students<00:01:07.380> because

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
that don't work for for students because

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.130 
that don't work for for students because
you<00:01:08.369> can't<00:01:08.670> put<00:01:09.240> everything<00:01:09.450> together<00:01:09.840> in

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
you can't put everything together in

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
you can't put everything together in
chronological<00:01:10.619> order<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.340> make<00:01:11.490> sense<00:01:11.789> out<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
chronological order to make sense out of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.359 
chronological order to make sense out of
it<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.350> other<00:01:13.530> big<00:01:13.710> mistake<00:01:14.070> people<00:01:14.219> make

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
it and the other big mistake people make

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.919 
it and the other big mistake people make
as<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.789> just<00:01:14.969> mentioned<00:01:15.359> is<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.479> they<00:01:15.689> move

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
as I just mentioned is that they move

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.169 
as I just mentioned is that they move
too<00:01:16.140> quickly<00:01:16.560> through<00:01:16.950> these<00:01:17.070> pieces<00:01:17.399> because

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
too quickly through these pieces because

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.899 
too quickly through these pieces because
they<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.390> want<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> end<00:01:19.909> what

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
they just want to get to the end what

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.760 
they just want to get to the end what
you<00:01:20.939> got<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> remember<00:01:21.270> there<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.719> no<00:01:21.899> end<00:01:22.170> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you got to remember there is no end it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
you got to remember there is no end it
doesn't<00:01:23.070> work<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.399> way<00:01:23.609> you<00:01:24.179> just<00:01:24.570> keep

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
doesn't work that way you just keep

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.990 
doesn't work that way you just keep
building<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.710> pieces<00:01:26.070> until<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.700> becomes

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
building these pieces until it becomes

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.569 
building these pieces until it becomes
something<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.359> you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.990> utilize<00:01:28.399> you<00:01:29.399> are
