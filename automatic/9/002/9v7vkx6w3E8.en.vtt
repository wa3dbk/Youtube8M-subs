bob-tailed it back in to give me a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.820 
bob-tailed it back in to give me a
better<00:00:23.510> approach<00:00:23.869> angle<00:00:24.200> for<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:24.410> rear<00:00:24.619> as

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
better approach angle for the rear as

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.650 
better approach angle for the rear as
well<00:00:25.400> as<00:00:25.490> cut<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:25.760> front<00:00:25.940> end<00:00:26.119> out<00:00:26.270> and<00:00:26.510> move

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
well as cut the front end out and move

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.940 
well as cut the front end out and move
the<00:00:26.810> diff<00:00:26.990> forward<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:27.500> I<00:00:27.529> get<00:00:27.710> a<00:00:27.740> better

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
the diff forward so I get a better

the diff forward so I get a better
approach<00:00:28.190> angle<00:00:28.580> it<00:00:28.940> is<00:00:29.060> quite<00:00:29.300> long<00:00:29.510> but<00:00:29.930> up

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
approach angle it is quite long but up
