00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.450
 never and now this rod and sources was 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.130
 in the Aztec stadium in the match 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.170
 between america and atlético de madrid and we 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.190
 have the subsequent reactions to this 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.020
 duel of the euro cup American 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.910
 How about Carlos Roberto I greet you with 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.530
 very much taste because it was already carried out 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.050
 the match corresponding to the cup 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.800
 American euro between the america and the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.869
 athletic of madrid 1 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.759
 to finish by the criminal courts 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.949
 with victory for the group of 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.050
 eagles to some extent expected 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.300
 that this party is left to be and so 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.460
 create several changes throughout the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.320
 match while both squads are 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.629
 they reserved some picture players 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.640
 holder however for the second 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.769
 half some you play with set pieces and 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.570
 long distance shots between 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.460
 they had the fans who gave 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.260
 a very good entry into the colossus of 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.930
 St. Ursula much better than that 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.269
 I was waiting a few days ago and both 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.039
 strategists who are satisfied with the 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.719
 act of his squad we listen in 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.030
 first instance the words of the 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.580
 america coach Antonio Mohamed and 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.970
 then to diego simeone wait for the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.970
 mattress 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.640
 it was for its current period 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:25.130
 habitually it served us a lot to see 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:31.330
 how are they and I think in depth 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:35.200
 but good about football 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.200
 I think we go from low to high 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.560
 we have done a good game we worked 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.560
 very good as a team 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.090
 and that is not gender 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.260
 of the america that playing at home is a 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.360
 very difficult team in height that 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.710
 epoch but it has its complications for 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.990
 the team that is super-accustomed to 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.900
 to play 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.540
 in this field 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.370
 and if a very few changes in the party 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.520
 they made five in a row 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.039
 so that 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.989
 I do not have a good 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.290
 a good idea of ​​the party in terms of 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:18.030
 collective work and the answers 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.500
 individual of almost all good by 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.629
 last to note that the archer of 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.480
 america a gonzález was recognized as 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.260
