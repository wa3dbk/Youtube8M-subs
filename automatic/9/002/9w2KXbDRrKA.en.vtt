to<00:02:30.280> just<00:02:30.520> trust<00:02:30.850> me<00:02:31.120> that's<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.350> words<00:02:32.740> are

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
to just trust me that's the words are

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.080 
to just trust me that's the words are
embossed<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:34.290> some<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.500> lines<00:02:36.280> on<00:02:36.790> the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
embossed and some of the lines on the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.040 
embossed and some of the lines on the
outside<00:02:37.720> are<00:02:38.080> also<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.720> pretty<00:02:40.930> cool

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
outside are also and this is pretty cool

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.250 
outside are also and this is pretty cool
because<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:42.220> front<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.940> box<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:44.020> same

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
because the front of the box is the same

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.920 
because the front of the box is the same
as<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.650> back<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:45.850> that's<00:02:45.970> something<00:02:46.270> that<00:02:46.450> you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
as the back so that's something that you

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.980 
as the back so that's something that you
don't<00:02:47.080> really<00:02:47.290> usually<00:02:47.830> see<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.540> that's<00:02:49.810> very
