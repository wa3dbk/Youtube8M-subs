00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
I shot him he was kind of impressed so I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.260 
I shot him he was kind of impressed so I
had<00:00:55.020> an<00:00:55.140> idea<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.070> with<00:00:56.309> TNT<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:59.270> what

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
had an idea to do this with TNT and what

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.690 
had an idea to do this with TNT and what
we<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.219> exact<00:01:02.730> same<00:01:02.910> setup

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
we got here is just the exact same setup

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.160 
we got here is just the exact same setup
with<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:06.650> just<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.770> small<00:01:07.979> type<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.340> TNT<00:01:08.760> and

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
with a just a small type of TNT and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.870 
with a just a small type of TNT and
cobblestone<00:01:10.170> generator<00:01:11.990> reconnect<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
cobblestone generator reconnect this

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.190 
cobblestone generator reconnect this
because<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.479> there<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> didn't<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.170> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
because just like there I didn't want it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.630 
because just like there I didn't want it
going<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.619> while<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.159> setting<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:18.290> so

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
going up while I was setting up so

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.840 
going up while I was setting up so
pretty<00:01:20.640> much<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.890> try<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> maximize<00:01:23.189> space

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
pretty much it's a try to maximize space

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.560 
pretty much it's a try to maximize space
it<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.360> fit<00:01:25.080> um<00:01:26.180> 14<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:28.530> math<00:01:29.100> wise<00:01:29.400> get<00:01:30.390> one

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it can fit um 14 so math wise get one

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.330 
it can fit um 14 so math wise get one
firing<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.990> every<00:01:31.290> five<00:01:31.439> minutes<00:01:32.119> that's<00:01:33.119> an

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
firing up every five minutes that's an

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.140 
firing up every five minutes that's an
hour<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.579> 10<00:01:35.729> minutes<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.540> fun<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.970> course

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
hour and 10 minutes of fun so of course

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.460 
hour and 10 minutes of fun so of course
you<00:01:42.329> know<00:01:42.420> you'd<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.840> go<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.170> reload

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
you know you'd have to go on and reload

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.899 
you know you'd have to go on and reload
it<00:01:43.619> every<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.340> then<00:01:46.220> but<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:47.610> again

it's pretty much it I usually like to

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.380 
it's pretty much it I usually like to
set<00:02:51.600> these<00:02:51.630> clocks<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:53.750> shorter<00:02:54.750> speed<00:02:56.390> just

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
set these clocks to shorter speed just

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.229 
set these clocks to shorter speed just
my<00:02:57.569> preference<00:02:59.269> but<00:03:00.269> that's<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.080> gist<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.410> it

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
my preference but that's the gist of it

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.390 
my preference but that's the gist of it
again<00:03:03.239> who<00:03:03.390> little<00:03:03.660> overview<00:03:04.010> got<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.130> clock

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
again who little overview got the clock

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.390 
again who little overview got the clock
which<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.709> dispenser<00:03:07.709> with<00:03:07.829> block<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.190> front

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
which is dispenser with block in front

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.840 
which is dispenser with block in front
of<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:09.079> so<00:03:10.079> it<00:03:10.200> always<00:03:10.350> lands<00:03:10.650> here<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.310> block

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
of it so it always lands here and block

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.970 
of it so it always lands here and block
behind<00:03:12.060> there<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.840> doesn't<00:03:13.110> go<00:03:13.560> too<00:03:13.620> far

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
behind there so it doesn't go too far

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.560 
behind there so it doesn't go too far
out<00:03:14.570> pressure<00:03:15.570> plate<00:03:15.980> repeater<00:03:16.980> block<00:03:17.790> the

water and then a block over the torch to

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.830 
water and then a block over the torch to
power<00:03:25.890> these<00:03:26.220> if<00:03:26.820> you're<00:03:27.000> Peter<00:03:27.239> onto<00:03:27.600> or

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
power these if you're Peter onto or

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.710 
power these if you're Peter onto or
Peter<00:03:28.170> on<00:03:28.320> one<00:03:28.880> this<00:03:29.880> one<00:03:30.120> just<00:03:30.209> goes<00:03:30.359> down<00:03:30.600> to

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
Peter on one this one just goes down to

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.900 
Peter on one this one just goes down to
a<00:03:30.750> piston<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.410> important<00:03:31.709> part<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.190> i<00:03:32.700> have<00:03:32.790> a

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
a piston the important part and i have a

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.449 
a piston the important part and i have a
few<00:03:33.390> holes<00:03:33.690> around<00:03:33.900> here<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.250> can<00:03:35.400> see

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
few holes around here so you can see

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.300 
few holes around here so you can see
from<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.850> mini-map<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.980> make<00:03:40.980> sure<00:03:41.190> you

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
from the mini-map is to make sure you

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.400 
from the mini-map is to make sure you
don't<00:03:41.459> have<00:03:41.579> any<00:03:41.850> power<00:03:42.269> box<00:03:42.570> such<00:03:42.840> activity

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
don't have any power box such activity

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.759 
don't have any power box such activity
or<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.950> will<00:03:44.070> have<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.280> big<00:03:44.670> mistake<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:46.590> yeah

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
just have this arcing over the tnt down

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.729 
just have this arcing over the tnt down
to<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:52.140> piston<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:54.660> one<00:03:54.870> again<00:03:55.440> with

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
to this piston and this one again with

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.940 
to this piston and this one again with
the<00:03:55.829> one<00:03:55.980> tick<00:03:56.390> going<00:03:57.390> over<00:03:57.630> here<00:03:57.959> pushing<00:03:58.739> the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
the one tick going over here pushing the

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.789 
the one tick going over here pushing the
cobble<00:03:59.340> generate<00:03:59.819> it<00:04:00.470> generated<00:04:01.470> from<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
cobble generate it generated from the

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.290 
cobble generate it generated from the
generator<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:03.739> that's<00:04:04.739> about<00:04:04.920> it

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
generator and that's about it

really wanted to you could like set this
up<00:04:33.540> in<00:04:33.720> like<00:04:33.870> a<00:04:33.900> hallway<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.680> your<00:04:34.920> house<00:04:35.570> as

up in like a hallway to your house as
I've<00:04:36.720> seen<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:36.930> lot<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.170> like<00:04:37.350> secret<00:04:37.710> doors<00:04:39.890> all

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
I've seen a lot of like secret doors all

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.840 
I've seen a lot of like secret doors all
right<00:04:41.010> I'll<00:04:41.130> just<00:04:41.370> some<00:04:41.520> sort<00:04:41.700> of<00:04:41.760> how<00:04:41.820> I

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
right I'll just some sort of how I

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.050 
right I'll just some sort of how I
someone's<00:04:42.240> walking<00:04:42.360> through<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:44.640> just<00:04:44.670> go<00:04:44.940> on

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
someone's walking through and just go on

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:52.880 
someone's walking through and just go on
somewhere<00:04:46.970> and<00:04:47.970> that'll<00:04:48.270> go<00:04:48.360> off<00:04:50.900> but<00:04:51.900> that's

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
somewhere and that'll go off but that's

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.350 
somewhere and that'll go off but that's
another<00:04:53.160> little<00:04:53.310> application<00:04:53.790> if<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.120> felt

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
another little application if you felt

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.970 
another little application if you felt
like<00:04:54.420> it<00:04:56.210> it<00:04:57.210> I'd<00:04:57.330> just<00:04:57.650> start<00:04:58.650> off<00:04:58.770> right

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
like it it I'd just start off right

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.960 
like it it I'd just start off right
there<00:04:59.600> but<00:05:00.600> that's<00:05:00.750> pretty<00:05:00.900> much<00:05:01.020> it<00:05:01.790> again<00:05:02.790> I

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
there but that's pretty much it again I

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:14.930 
there but that's pretty much it again I
think<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:03.240> holds<00:05:03.740> 14<00:05:08.570> oops<00:05:13.190> well<00:05:14.190> that'll<00:05:14.790> be

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
think it holds 14 oops well that'll be

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.659 
think it holds 14 oops well that'll be
it<00:05:16.280> again<00:05:17.280> that's<00:05:18.860> why<00:05:19.860> this<00:05:19.919> isn't<00:05:20.460> in<00:05:20.640> my

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
it again that's why this isn't in my

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.150 
it again that's why this isn't in my
test<00:05:21.330> world<00:05:22.970> because<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.510> created<00:05:25.140> a<00:05:25.470> good

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
test world because I created a good

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.380 
test world because I created a good
amount<00:05:26.340> of<00:05:26.430> holes<00:05:26.640> already<00:05:28.220> but<00:05:29.240> thank<00:05:30.240> you

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
amount of holes already but thank you

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.970 
amount of holes already but thank you
very<00:05:30.660> much<00:05:30.840> for<00:05:30.870> watching<00:05:33.230> yeah<00:05:34.230> it's<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.919> su<00:05:35.130> a
