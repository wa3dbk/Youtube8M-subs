00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.559
 I greet the friends of androidworld.it 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.350
 I want to focus on why 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.740
 finally the most interesting function 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:21.250
 newer more innovative than that lg has 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.400
 introduced in this lg gip all 8.3 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.759
 this is the application the application is 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.759
 already present on chip ad and coupÃ© the 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.930
 obviously it works then you will understand only 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.260
 along with another smartphone 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.450
 now this is a lg g2 but it works with 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.100
 any android smartphone because 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.770
 the cooper application is available 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.530
 free on the play store 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.300
 from here it should be installed ie it is already 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.610
 installed to update it is done 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:56.140
 through the application present in the like 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.140
 I call you I tell you right away 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.210
 however, the update center 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:07.670
 ok apply lg application of lg 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.300
 let's start then turn it down 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.550
 we activate here not connected has already been 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.000
 made the first pairing it active 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.140
 also here and now it should be activated 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.880
 matter of a moment 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:28.570
 ok it's not a given not gone now 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:31.490
 yes yes no flashes he is thinking about it 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.890
 connected these are all options 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.750
 available what it means means that 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.640
 everything that happens here comes 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.380
 also transported here where everything is 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.960
 these items here so call and 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.220
 notifications and social network messages 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.180
 internet notes by phone and sticker 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.060
 recent application that we will see later for 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:55.190
 the last spends Italy we start with the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:00.140
 so call now i will call the 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:04.070
 my ag2 from another device I put the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.840
 hand here because I have to cover the number 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.030
 phone 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.020
 ok now both are playing a 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.600
 this beautiful sport 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.820
 what I can do I can refuse 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.290
 refuse and so we immediately try to con 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.170
 another function because now the will arrive 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.050
 message here it is the phone call 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.400
 missed and you see that the message is 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.070
 arrived here I arrived here too 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.600
 I can then reply to the message 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.040
 I can respond to the text message 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.970
 phone call I can't answer 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.890
 I can either hang up or answer 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.530
 with a message as a message to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.200
 defined therefore these are two of the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.660
 social network social network functions 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.780
 in fact, that complex is demonstrated 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.630
 because we say well that most 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.790
 of these does not make much sense because 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.370
 it could probably be us 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.550
 let's synchronize on both facebook 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.950
 both hangouts for example a useful thing 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.630
 whatsapp I have tried though and it is not 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.750
 absolutely nothing happened 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:15.560
 quick memo does what it promises then 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.560
 if I say hello to everyone 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.100
 this turn into a beautiful sun 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:27.019
 on an artist I had to be a painter e 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.019
 I save him in the tunnel 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:43.019
 if I go looking for it on the g2 if I go 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:46.380
 looking on the g2 here today two ok 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:50.640
 here he is also arrived up here 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.200
 true then we go on the internet on 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.459
 telephone internet by phone is perhaps 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.530
 one of the things I think about most 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.530
 interesting because she the ring is not 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.019
 hard to do but think about them 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.739
 always keep paired and to start 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.549
 the thing will be enough to press him not end 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.519
 you will have to do something else 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.519
 so now you will surf the internet 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:20.769
 through this smartphone you see wifi 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.620
 it started again I had turned it off and been 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.860
 using right now the connection 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.220
 data of this other smartphone therefore a 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.670
 a little slower than the classic wifi but 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.670
 never working 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:43.210
 ok then still still push here of the 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.770
 wifi series marcelo smalley yes finally it 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.420
 recent application sticker that 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.010
 therefore it works in both directions 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:52.710
 what does it mean 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.710
 means that I open the browser 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.690
 this I blocked I go to browse 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.690
 against the word 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.410
 we wait for the upload ok we are there 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.160
 we're sandro edward now what 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.810
 I do 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.330
 meanwhile shoot on this android e 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:25.160
 poor thing has never done anything wrong 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:28.160
 block I'm going to unlock I'm going to unlock 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.090
 i g2 and this sticker will appear 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.880
 they are I press the landmark reopens me 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:38.000
 web browsing web browsing that 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.979
 it works or I've only checked at least one 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.139
 me only works with the stock browser and 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:46.820
 only on the g2 only, for example on 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.190
 other smartphones opens me up simply 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.880
 chrome because obviously the browser then 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.500
 tow and different but it opens me up only 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.580
 browsers without taking me to the page 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:03.639
 I can do other tests I can open 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:13.310
 video do the opposite 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:20.060
 here it is you see here I go up instead 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:21.650
 play store see here my name is and it 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.599
 sticker of the play store obviously if so 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.180
 we will be siap and the professor also from 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:27.770
 this other part is made for 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.440
 Accuracy Crash Early Motorhome May 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.270
 other part is a very very function 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.849
 interesting especially because lg is 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.620
 was very farsighted had made a 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:38.210
 good thing this function has surrendered 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.449
 available for everyone so it is not 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.949
 need to have a lg smartphone for 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.560
 take advantage of cuper 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:49.990
 for this focus everything is a greeting dai 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.990
