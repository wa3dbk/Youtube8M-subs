Alexander and a girl Caroline Reese so
that'll<00:00:28.279> be<00:00:28.399> exciting<00:00:29.029> but<00:00:29.540> not<00:00:29.720> only<00:00:30.050> will<00:00:30.230> we

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
that'll be exciting but not only will we

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.889 
that'll be exciting but not only will we
find<00:00:30.590> out<00:00:30.770> that<00:00:30.980> we'll<00:00:31.309> also<00:00:31.520> find<00:00:31.910> out<00:00:32.210> and

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
find out that we'll also find out and

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.220 
find out that we'll also find out and
also<00:00:33.079> rule<00:00:33.470> out<00:00:33.710> any<00:00:34.190> anomalies<00:00:34.940> that<00:00:35.230> are

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
also rule out any anomalies that are

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.689 
also rule out any anomalies that are
still<00:00:36.649> lingering

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
still lingering

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.819 
still lingering
I<00:00:38.179> think<00:00:38.750> that<00:00:38.960> today<00:00:39.260> we'll<00:00:39.469> find<00:00:39.649> out

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
I think that today we'll find out

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.369 
I think that today we'll find out
whether<00:00:40.070> spina<00:00:41.000> bifida<00:00:41.390> is<00:00:41.690> a<00:00:41.780> probability

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
whether spina bifida is a probability

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.740 
whether spina bifida is a probability
and<00:00:42.589> things<00:00:43.399> of<00:00:43.579> that<00:00:43.699> nature<00:00:43.760> at<00:00:44.329> my<00:00:44.480> first

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
and things of that nature at my first

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.650 
and things of that nature at my first
ultrasound<00:00:45.339> down<00:00:46.339> syndrome<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:46.940> some<00:00:47.449> of<00:00:47.570> the

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
ultrasound down syndrome and some of the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.139 
ultrasound down syndrome and some of the
other<00:00:47.809> chromosome<00:00:48.379> disorders<00:00:49.039> were<00:00:49.249> ruled

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
other chromosome disorders were ruled

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.829 
other chromosome disorders were ruled
out

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
out

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.529 
out
it<00:00:51.109> leads<00:00:51.379> to<00:00:51.499> a<00:00:51.620> small<00:00:51.890> percentage<00:00:52.399> of<00:00:52.460> what<00:00:53.300> I

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
it leads to a small percentage of what I

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.229 
it leads to a small percentage of what I
would<00:00:53.780> have<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:54.410> I'm<00:00:54.530> curious<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.160> see<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:56.179> make

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
would have so I'm curious to see to make

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.209 
would have so I'm curious to see to make

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
will it be that way the whole time it'll

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.900 
will it be that way the whole time it'll
be<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.349> way<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.620> basically<00:02:18.280> moves<00:02:18.550> up<00:02:18.790> a

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
be that way it basically moves up a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.059 
be that way it basically moves up a
little<00:02:19.090> bit<00:02:19.239> as<00:02:19.300> your<00:02:19.450> uterus<00:02:19.810> grows<00:02:20.019> but<00:02:20.920> it's

not going to go to the back basically of

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.610 
not going to go to the back basically of
your<00:02:24.010> uterus<00:02:24.269> Liston<00:02:25.269> is<00:02:25.300> right<00:02:25.690> here<00:02:25.989> it's
