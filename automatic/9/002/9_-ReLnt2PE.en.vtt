00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.130 

you<00:03:12.770> want<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.070> head<00:03:13.310> 2<00:03:13.760> volt<00:03:14.480> when<00:03:14.720> one<00:03:14.900> gift

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
you want a head 2 volt when one gift

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.270 
you want a head 2 volt when one gift
shop<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:18.020> it's<00:03:18.350> a<00:03:18.470> shame<00:03:18.740> I<00:03:18.770> have<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.130> head

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
shop and it's a shame I have to head

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.800 
shop and it's a shame I have to head
through<00:03:19.460> all<00:03:19.640> those<00:03:19.760> gates<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.210> didn't<00:03:20.570> want<00:03:20.720> to

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
through all those gates I didn't want to

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.240 
through all those gates I didn't want to
put<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.500> through<00:03:21.590> all<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.040> constraints<00:03:22.760> that

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
put you through all the constraints that

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.860 
put you through all the constraints that
the<00:03:25.250> city<00:03:25.520> couldn't<00:03:25.850> just<00:03:26.000> be<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.540> know<00:03:26.630> one

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
the city couldn't just be you know one

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.780 
the city couldn't just be you know one
big<00:03:27.110> city<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.740> if<00:03:27.860> you<00:03:27.920> broken<00:03:28.280> up<00:03:28.340> like<00:03:28.550> that

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
big city that if you broken up like that

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:37.660 
big city that if you broken up like that
gets<00:03:29.660> in<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.050> engine<00:03:30.410> can<00:03:30.680> handle<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:36.670> okay

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
gets in the engine can handle it okay

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.460 
gets in the engine can handle it okay
and<00:03:37.970> right<00:03:38.120> now<00:03:38.270> I'm<00:03:38.390> some<00:03:38.720> too<00:03:38.900> lazy<00:03:39.170> to

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
and right now I'm some too lazy to

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.460 
and right now I'm some too lazy to
actually<00:03:39.500> buy<00:03:40.870> some<00:03:41.870> actual<00:03:42.320> editing

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
actually buy some actual editing

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.660 
actually buy some actual editing
software<00:03:43.340> i<00:03:43.370> probably<00:03:43.910> should<00:03:44.270> get<00:03:44.480> some<00:03:45.670> it's

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
software i probably should get some it's

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.130 
software i probably should get some it's
what<00:03:46.850> could<00:03:47.000> fast-forward<00:03:47.450> bits<00:03:47.959> like<00:03:48.170> that

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
what could fast-forward bits like that

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.050 
what could fast-forward bits like that
anyways<00:03:51.140> now<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.620> we're<00:03:52.010> actually<00:03:52.520> in<00:03:52.940> the
