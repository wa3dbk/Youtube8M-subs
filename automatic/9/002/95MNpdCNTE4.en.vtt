00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello you dear welcome to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.589
 design joy i was just shopping 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.559
 namely in the case of Budni and the Arabs 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.980
 things you know in vain 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.130
 really great on your child of one 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.080
 tuba and this time he is such a hat 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.180
 a purchase where I also nail polish and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.070
 kajalstift has but still 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.529
 I just wanted to show you 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.939
 which is typical so that's in my 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.769
 nothing special but it works 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:45.870
 just to show you 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:48.780
 By the way, soy schnitzel consumption of 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.489
 a ground which look as the use 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.710
 I very often that one can be wonderful 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.660
 use instead of he has meat substitute 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.940
 So you just need a little bit of that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.379
 insert broth or water as needed 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.020
 how you like that if you can 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.030
 Of course you want to have joked in brÃ¼hl 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.760
 and then you can have them on and so 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.100
 then, as it were, one like mincemeat 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.530
 Such mass and that is of course no 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:17.009
 meat soy and therefore also vegan 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.840
 then I have here so humus rather 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.540
 Of course, tasting yourself tastes good 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.140
 best but one I tell you mine 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.200
 love 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.570
 So I have never had one 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.070
 finished humus bought so delicious there 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.439
 of course, plays as if I had the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.710
 next to straight made and that is 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.490
 that of the company nature bio and fresh 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.170
 100 percent organic food so chickpeas 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.040
 and sesame with ingredients from organic 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.770
 farming 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.140
 that's what it looks like and I love where I have to 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.020
 So that really tastes very good 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.240
 I hate alnatura so much here 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.670
 tuscany 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.649
 this is a tomato sauce, so to speak 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.350
 you then noodle with others 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.100
 may refuse things so does it look like 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.470
 I really like that because here 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.420
 salary is very high so 92 percent 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.369
 Among other things, there are still carrots 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.880
 onions basil and garlic in it 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.950
 and I do not know if you know that 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.760
 many ready sauces have always been so 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.860
 this taste of which is as intended 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.950
 You can taste the lights that 's just the way it is 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.140
 a ready-made soup is and here I am 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.780
 the impression that you just the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.069
 tomatoes and everything was done well 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.430
 and just in her glass 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.319
 So I've already taken care of that 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.330
 to have everything fresh but these things 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.890
 taste just as fresh because of it 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.870
 It is not worth it all that 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.989
 time to make a tenth here 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.450
 pack carinthia fragrant always read 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.190
 I like it because of the genie 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.730
 smell is not so strong but still 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.620
 another hint of vanilla in the room 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.620
 So you smell that pretty good and 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.560
 then I have a greens here now 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.730
 I also always buy a lot when I am 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.530
 then have time I do, of course, 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.329
 but even if I have no time 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.640
 and that really appeals to them 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.709
 Drink right now bought me that 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.320
 always being so this is as a kind of 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.859
 It's called antioxidant hughes and how 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.269
 green 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:26.750
 the house is also from the cool shelf 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.209
 fairtrade bio and what's in there 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.799
 the grape juice orange juice apple juice 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.600
 mango curry man banana pury spirulina 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:39.560
 kurella wheatgrass stage green tea 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.740
 Rosehip and guests grass is more 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.890
 healthy loses everything 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.870
 and yes without further additions that's how it looks 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.180
 from I can recommend you who that 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:55.780
 would like to try it yourself, the 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:58.270
 yes, but you do that otherwise 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.160
 all your ingredients in the wand mixer that 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.810
 is I am doing well and nothing the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.350
 together and then you have something here 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.230
 delicious and sympathetic then I have her 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.360
 from tetesept schokotraum also 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.850
 meanwhile, everyone has noticed 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.170
 that I like bari that's what it looks like 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.270
 it smells heavenly and is super great 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.070
 two things that are actually now 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.110
 football maybe not at all 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.430
 it is once nail polish 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.230
 from p21 part looks like this is out 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.690
 I like it a lot 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.390
 but somehow stupidly familiar 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.030
 and of course my essence 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.370
 lasting one I so in black and 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.380
 in turquoise and this time I have with 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.210
 the green ones are the only ones 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.640
 they're always gone, really 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.430
 always well sold out that's really 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.250
 kajalstift if he is lure 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.690
 In the month call you can really 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.180
 trust it because it has heart 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.040
 really these pins so he sees 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.680
 and he has a really great one 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.990
 color and I like that very well 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.750
 because it lasts a long time and not so fast 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.270
 off you go so that it was from a shopping 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.800
 at budni I hope you liked it 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.950
 it's just about you doing it 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.450
 so a little in insight into mine 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.280
 have a grocery bag and hereby see 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.310
 could you when I am traveling times 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.140
 I have to 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.120
 a take it from me, although I thank 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.030
 Of course I'm always happy to see you 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.370
 positive comments or a thumb 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.200
 high and abo and would like to 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.840
 you know if we know the products 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.910
 and what you like most about it and 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.770
 What you like to buy and what you like me 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.500
 could recommend so many things 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.180
 all at once but I am therefore too 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.950
 Try funny and have these things 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.830
 I stop myself I think if 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.110
 you stand so from this shelf and yes 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.150
 So things like trying so then 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.370
 you just have to do it 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.650
 you can see something appealing, for example 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.510
 you agree - and that speaks 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.730
 but you really should too 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.890
 have a go try so far so far 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.260
 I have very very positive experiences with 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:04.060
 Alnatura made and I'm really very 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.060
 Happy until next time bye
