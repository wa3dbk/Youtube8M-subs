00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.990
 the safety is for the driver 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.880
 Of course the highest commandment was that 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.680
 Of course, the most important thing is when 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.959
 helmet that must be a safety helmet 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.959
 the supreme norma that is too 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.060
 fh 80 60 on we go, of course, 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.010
 in the case of the overall their partly two 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.110
 or three is below it's then 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.090
 another fireproof underwear this 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.160
 then deposit but synonymous with all parts 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.630
 which we then have to carry is the 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.550
 comfort most importantly because straight 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.289
 the long distance race if you have a 24 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.820
 For some hours you have to three to 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.930
 four hours is driving in one piece 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.530
 Of course it is also important that the driver 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.530
 feels good 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.300
 the lmp1 vehicles are with the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.220
 fastest vehicles ever 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.600
 There is of course in the motorsport world 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.850
 scary fun for the driver 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.020
 Such cars to drive with huge from 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.160
 shoot rich man extreme 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.830
 Turning speeds for 2014 will be 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.550
 the following security elements 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.300
 the driver changes the driver 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.070
 sit higher 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.690
 the experienced better all-round visibility 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.760
 the townhouses can be better for 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.130
 but can also look at the curve entrance 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.449
 the cars that are mine are in traffic 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.880
 the slower vehicles are much better 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.400
 perceive enormous security 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.050
 second are the wheels with steel cables 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.940
 secured on the monocoque there again 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.770
 in case of accident that the wheels 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.630
 not fly around freely and the third 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.490
 point also important point is that one 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.040
 better crash box for a rear impact 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.690
 I think that will be quite true 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.240
 important that the fh and that the 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.750
 manufacturers always justify 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.940
 increase fair values ​​and also a lot 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.960
 put more emphasis on that that the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.750
 moment the cars also much safer 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.880
 that will start that the lmp1 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.470
 then vehicles must be closed 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.090
 that means with the roof that has 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.009
 security improved enormously and to 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.440
 second for four years is one 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.390
 Carbon fiber monocoque firmly prescribed 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.780
 which then as a security payment to 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.610
 Bike is always built around it 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.920
 say you can not do enough for it 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.300
 he still has to stay on the ball but 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.220
 I like that as such a 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.220
 positive development for 2014
