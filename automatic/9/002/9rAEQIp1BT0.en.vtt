00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.080
 and then lu written all right here who 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.789
 What are you talking about is the virus that is well 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.199
 I like the video here on my channel. 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.849
 people and today I'm here to 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.830
 present for you the beginning of a 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.289
 new series here on the channel that will be a 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.000
 series of tricks I see right there with 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.579
 based on the videos my friends that you 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.590
 curtam enough videos of some rejoinder 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.420
 so I think it would be really cool, I just 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.579
 still on the channel once a week 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.320
 or once every two weeks bringing 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.570
 this type of content that for the channel 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.210
 Taewan guys until I going to do today 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.579
 I had help from some big-heads there and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.710
 they helped me a lot to become an athlete 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.289
 then the enrollment will be the credits 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.449
 he is right and channel and sat down 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.010
 you do there and gives a given because 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.800
 the guys send enough of the darkness 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.809
 good and until today we will do 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.880
 calls death row because a 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.439
 very top technique and will write down the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.439
 kits that you will need that you had 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.520
 number 1 the inter b gt number 2 snack and 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.409
 kit number 3 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.119
 then we have these three basic questions 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.580
 then you will need to go 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.670
 to spend many hours there of fun and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.920
 much joy ii laughter with the staff 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.049
 fell into darkness and who knows how to generate 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.299
 Nail there for you, it's alright, guys. 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.299
 a lot of yelling let's go the athlete then 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.420
 You left here on the spot. 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.670
 and I put this 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.710
 This is the little pebble here to indicate where 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.410
 What are you going to have to get down then? 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.600
 when you get hg the yen is already running 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.970
 pick up a wood actually catch three 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.030
 wood is to pick and descend 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.390
 is about 15-20 blocks is 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.090
 can top that up for power is not 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.400
 so to the eye and the faces 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.650
 realize that the pf but this one more 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.670
 or less about 15 20 blocks is more or 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.950
 least in the layer is 45 40 out there 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.690
 8 You may be even more here is the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.580
 least because the teacher is not so 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.110
 easy on and good guys now one 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.070
 very important thing looking at the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.840
 south right 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.940
 It's how you watch some strikes already 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.390
 you should know that when the address is pulled 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.430
 huh 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.530
 it would come to the south so it is much more 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.590
 easy for you back there or something 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.480
 But it's going to be a better thing. 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.640
 You do travel south 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.880
 just squeeze your keyboard f3eg 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.440
 and look here, then, good sute so 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.010
 after you come down looking at the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.680
 south 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.390
 You 're digging there are six blocks. 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.760
 forward then it's full of pedro 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.580
 farms and cava 123456 good in block census 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.500
 you will're digging here're more or 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.110
 at least 17 block then 1234567 plus or 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.330
 except for this and here in the background a man 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.340
 this week he down the demon is 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.900
 put Gabriel who will put the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.239
 pressure plate for those who do not know what 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.340
 I fear when you stay here, good everything. 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.570
 explodes so this is a very good thing 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.330
 fine 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.239
 the demo doing this you already lose 3 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.430
 up and goes through several buttons and 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.320
 stay is that the guy is to prevent the guy 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.329
 make energy so this is going to be a 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.530
 very good thing then you go putting 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.030
 here o 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.160
 or if you want you can be 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.230
 putting some plates I think would be 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.019
 even better but it will fill with a button 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.090
 here on this side and here while the 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.850
 demon will do that here the launcher 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:37.060
 drops about nine blocks eight and 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:42.160
 places here the smell then 12345678 and 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.370
 out of 8 was not much sex only 7 set one 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.950
 chicabon 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.659
 What do you love, are you here and can you? 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.700
 do that it will rise right 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.190
 So it's going to be like this and here guys 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.750
 put the launch but do not walk 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.239
 here it is because otherwise you will 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.459
 to be thrown over here one will become one 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.980
 time here and it's about the time of 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.829
 about three seconds around 15 seconds 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.470
 they will fall here on the trip explode that's it 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.599
 this is the hallway will cause a death 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.000
 so that's why the name death row 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.430
 So done, guys, can you? 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.459
 take away here does not put it is your 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.620
 friends there the devil and a lounge can 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.199
 be opening here if you want 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.330
 observe and give help and I do not know 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.289
 hit in the face I stayed there 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.669
 to put some light to power there is to avoid 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.070
 that the face should come out 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.680
 and make it easier to visualize beauty 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.479
 they can stay there and back there 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.190
 You do your things, it's good here. 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.900
 The mother can make a little hole 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.760
 no ladder that will lead to the 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.620
 items from the guys that you pull athlete 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.810
 So make a ladder and leave it here. 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.850
 closed ring not going out and as soon as he 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.440
 died you come in here and get the 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.539
 things will not have more moment power 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.340
 so it gets much easier and lets 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.840
 capped good guys doing it on 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.210
 red will already take effect then 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.330
 the red will stay here in 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.220
 little place you will be plugging're here is I 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.250
 I can recommend to you what I 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.080
 I always do is stay here. 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.240
 up here because if you pull here 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.060
 in the same block, this is not going to happen 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.190
 here you will stay here and the block of 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.630
 the middle of a thump in case you go 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.460
 get inside will keep getting a little 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.650
 on his side then this can cause 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.930
 some years, this is going to be very 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.120
 boring so you both here win 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.410
 two blocks in height and then you stay there 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.479
 inside, then let's put it here 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.240
 up to two blocks in height for those who 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.650
 here and there you pull it will be transported 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.510
 inside and do not forget to put 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.340
 the launcher is good there 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.930
 Ideally you get a guy who is 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.599
 move upward then if you are 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.070
 passing that will pull good at the time you 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.840
 you pull right 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.150
 the guy will come and it automatically goes 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.270
 to step on it when he did here guys already 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.130
 it was already for him he will fly and he 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.450
 Will you stay here and look at you? 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.620
 can write whatever you want in the 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.389
 shock he'll stay 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.510
 but the boy a period of five seconds 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.820
 sakineh is the time of invincibility of the 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.160
 ibge and then it will fall with 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.440
 Caution down here and explode 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.290
 then guys a simple strike is okay 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.669
 but there is a bit of attention there in the 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.979
 time to do things but it's too much 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.750
 easy to do good then, since I 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.699
 I'll show you here how it's done. 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.320
 Let's go to some clips then ok. 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.540
 You want to see how it works in the 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.910
 practice, then this was the thesis of 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.770
 today it will leave its fan and until the 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.550
 next video on the channel stay there with 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.580
 clips 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.580
 A big hug everyone saw and I went 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.130
 only they want 

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:35.489
 Is not this personal I really hope that 

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:36.839
 You have tanned this video then 

00:07:35.489 --> 00:07:38.669
 Do you want the series to remain there? 

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:41.369

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:49.169
 second , third and so on the 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.969
