 Hello, I am Natalia Nekrasov, author 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.980
 save the site for us now we are with you 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.980
 knit a very interesting pattern 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.100
 openwork than the most simple reminds 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.550
 swayed round beetle such openwork 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.820
 very interesting advertising is very simple 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.480
 meaning 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.870
 knitting of such a pattern of transplants 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.000
 have we begin with the fact that 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.610
 we define as we will know drawing 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.460
 the most optimal for such a pattern 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.500
 size 10 game confused on these 10 games 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.360
 we suppose two figures here it turns out 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.030
 divide in half with respect to one 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:55.059
 we knit the plates on one side 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.900
 each time and the bugs knit their openwork 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.909
 these 6 rows 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.470
 2 countries fit in order not to 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.809
 confused nothing to mark very 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.560
 just a mark of the mind it serves 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.690
 the markup is platinum and either 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.490
 the numbering on the knitting machine is for 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.920
 not to be confused and not to think about 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.710
 this knit the first that we do the transfer 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.469
 pigtail the meaning of this transference is that 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:25.030
 we take either one tucker or two 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:29.020
 two comfortable shooting 2 loops and Jol at 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.450
 I should be right here for this 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.630
 ticks so in theory i would have to 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.789
 just move this loop but i'm filming 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:42.250
 I transfer the neighboring loop from there 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:45.250
 Must transfer and hostess this loop 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.380
 who were wearing top there that is 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.979
 transfer pigtail is that I 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.710
 loop which storey proglazhu ra 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.390
 I wear not on top but below under that loop 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.979
 which is 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.560
 already standing here go here this needle here 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.720
 This race I still take the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.840
 the next two needles do the same 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.840
 the most 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.459
 I rent 2 letters 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:18.950
 I first wear that loop that forms 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:22.230
 openwork on the next and top hostess 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:28.950
 that there already was obtained on the street 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:31.800
 2 zhurok here they are two transplants the same 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.410
 the deal with this country is relatively 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.320
 records of these 10 needles and two extreme 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.920
 buns just take off 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:45.570
 I dress that which forms openwork on 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.040
 extreme needle top hostess one openwork 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.030
 ready loop 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:55.290
 work needle 2 side by side standing exactly so 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.550
 same remove and 3 loops forming fat and 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.550
 Verka mistress 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:18.690
 two rows further transplanting 10 May 2 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.720
 peel with these for terribly replant 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.030
 only for the average loaf 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.560
 do transplant not outside how how where 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.090
 it is only that she was inside Garth 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.769
 I see the same openwork on the same 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:37.110
 places all three openwork go in one place 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.950
 but different types of transplant are three types 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:44.280
 transplanting 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:48.590
 1 2 this is done in order to lower 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:52.920
 loops they sort of formed formed 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:56.090
 care such that there is a pair of loop track 2 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:03.389
 series by duty and year 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:06.060
 2 rows 3 transplant is the easiest 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:09.030
 With the same needle that I owe 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.870
 I was just doing a simple form from the tyazhu 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:17.280
 A transfer to the neighboring sponges, that is, I 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.380
 I put my loops under the workers 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.720
 the needle from the face and you will not look like 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.660
 as if i'm on top of a pope dare 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.180
 because the simplest transplant is in one 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.139
 we use three types of transplants 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.470
 pigtail 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:37.849
 on the middle loop common and 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:40.440
 simple transplant which by the way for 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.870
 such u too clever things if you do 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.630
 manual transplantation is highly recommended 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.720
 pigtail she gives more relief volume 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.870
 get- together simple transplants do not give this 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.870
 effect 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:01.919
 cucumber finished this tank do then 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.740
 the same is relative to the second side 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.440
 Our 10 boards are my four races 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:13.229
 which is actually like this 3 km and 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:16.080
 participate compare with extreme needles 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:19.979
 wear on a platnic we take off for a loop 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.520
 weaving loops in a pigtail 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:26.030
 the side 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:31.860
 once the pumpkin works believing the real ones 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:37.740
 pigtail 1 transfer pigtail we looped 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:39.910
 bred to the side and the second 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:45.800
 part relative to 10 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:49.190
 the game can not do so often you can 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.780
 do 20 times feces can do like how 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.820
 whatever way you can not do 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.280
 one needle decker for 2 will hurt 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.270
 even more voluminous figure 3 coal something 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:02.570
 there is this drawing can be any 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:09.280
 diversity is infinite it's like a scheme 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:13.340
 the design is creative 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.660
 this process is the diversity of one and 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.110
 same scales to just 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.979
 fire if you take 2 fire and wind do 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.990
 the same picture will look 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:28.810
 quite to another 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:32.210
 can not be distracted if distracted 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.099
 fix pro check immediately before 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.760
 what are you going to see 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:40.509
 sliced 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:44.260
 see, I do see the talk hands 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:46.580
 it turns out frightened moved 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:53.270
 it's very easy to make a mistake 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:55.750
 yourself you two and the usual transplant 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.750
 the side 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.830
 set 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:15.360
 the third one more tank after 23 times 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:17.960
 show you see very quickly I do not know very much 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.960
 plain 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:24.180
 no difficulties but 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.430
 how beautiful you give 5 all tracks 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.280
 intertwined incomprehensibly as a just 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.830
 we transfer the loop from the bottom with a pigtail 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:37.520
 transplant sredinok transplant simple 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:37.520
 it turns out beautiful 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.430
 if you like you can 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.290
