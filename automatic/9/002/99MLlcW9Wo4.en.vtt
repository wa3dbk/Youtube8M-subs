00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.460
 The Humboldtsche Group is a unique customer-oriented system supplier 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.249
 For 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.290
 Machining and assembly of AMD 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.609
 Indium parts is specialized 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:19.449
 since then, the company has 260 employees, 100 of them in the Czech Republic 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.220
 Eurotek has a customer-oriented project organization 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.649
 Together with his team, the project manager discusses the requirements of the 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.719
 Customers and ensures the exact planning of the project 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.410
 in product development reason production preparation of the big one 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.910
 Pieces and Iceland are the most advanced CAD came and production control systems 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.320
 used 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.000
 the foundry and machining department employees work closely 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.750
 together 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.630
 in the work preparation is progressive casting 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.630
 Simulation software he used 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.990
 throughout the project, the project manager oversees the project 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.920
 conscientious 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.080
 doing so would have close contact with customers with suppliers and their own 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.930
 Departments in the own model workshop are made of plastic wood 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.930
 or aluminum made the required models 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.150
 the models are closely controlled before the connection 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.900
 also the Carinthians who are used for the big parts by the way Eurotek 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.150
 manufactured 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.530
 To this end, Euro has a fully automated learned core every day 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.390
 manufacturing systems 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.850
 After the preparation, the actual can complete forms and casting 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.860
 begin 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.860
 This happens on a fully automatic woman machine 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.930
 This machine is mainly used for medium-sized series 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.509
 by the automatic forms so a very exact one develops 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.560
 product quality 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.090
 both the quality of dancing molten aluminum of the models and 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.090
 The core used is being carefully monitored 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.610
 this machine 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.370
 It works with an innovative bus method in which there is no turbulence 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.360
 that flow into the aluminum gives more 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.360
 resulting in a higher homogeneity and smaller wall thicknesses 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.459
 even safety Steidle can be produced with it 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:29.889
 while the Ruckus 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.439
 while aluminum is pressed under low pressure in the St shape 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.189
 In addition, it is also possible to cast manually for optimal flexibility 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.779
 through hardness measurements and enough and rollers and train trials 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.779
 all of which are carried out in-house 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.069
 ensured 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.429
 even the St 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:48.599
 fully automatically controlled 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.459
 Eurotek has a self-developed overall system for the 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.999
 precision course 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.999
 With it, high accuracies can be achieved 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.889
 the products are in the exterior with the yard 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.189
 Opus comparable 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.189
 but at significantly lower cost 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.859
 without lifter inclined with wall thicknesses Pack 2 millimeters to be executed 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.800
 Eurotek has one both in the Netherlands and in the Czech Republic 

00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:36.889
 considerable CNC processing capacity of about 50 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.699
 cnc machines 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.590
 in the own department for spanish the processing is the on 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.590
 Tension optimally prepared for the big pieces 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:51.099
 there and Wozzeck the aluminum products under one roof both casting and 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.960
 can process and assemble 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.360
 These processing steps can be optimally coordinated with each other 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.539
 This is an outstanding feature of Folk Rock Tech 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.349
 the so-called where once shopping 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.419
 as an aluminum specialist for five euros, of course, carries over one 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.110
 specialized aluminum sheet processing and tail department 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.599
 during and after processing who owns the products with automatic three 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.419
 Controlled measuring instruments 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.889
 Quality is essential for TEuro Text and its customers 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.550
 Naturally, Eurotek has the ISOE Bund one thousand 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.800
 certificate 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.099
 After the breakdowns products are controlled, the assembly can begin 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.669
 The montages consist of complex compositions of mechanical and mechanical components 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.189
 electronic parts 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:44.240
 so-called with Catholic modules 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.339
 These are assembled by experienced technicians 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:48.430
 if necessary 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.430
 in special traffic come Kingdoms 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:56.830
 After assembly, a functional test is carried out with each module 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.090
 The products are often delivered directly to the customer of Eurotek 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.879
 sent 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.509
 without further control by the customer
