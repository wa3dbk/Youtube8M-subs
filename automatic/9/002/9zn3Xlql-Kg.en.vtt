00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
then two more of them here when you're

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.890 
then two more of them here when you're
just<00:00:31.800> fighting<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> one<00:00:32.250> by<00:00:32.430> himself<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:33.180> bunch

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
just fighting the one by himself a bunch

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.180 
just fighting the one by himself a bunch
of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> full<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.379> dogs<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> come

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
of the full of dogs are going to come

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.860 
of the full of dogs are going to come
back<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> boars<00:00:36.000> or<00:00:36.300> whatever<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> hell<00:00:36.720> they

are

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.380 

and<00:00:41.039> you're<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:41.999> lot<00:00:42.239> faster<00:00:42.539> than<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.829> Cyclops

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
and you're a lot faster than the Cyclops

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.099 
and you're a lot faster than the Cyclops
so<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.690> use<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.839> to<00:00:46.050> your

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
so you have to use that to your

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:52.759 
so you have to use that to your
advantage<00:00:50.539> grab<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.780> boars<00:00:52.019> whenever<00:00:52.620> they

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
advantage grab the boars whenever they

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.200 
advantage grab the boars whenever they
come<00:00:52.890> after<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:54.949> just<00:00:55.949> hit<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> Cyclops

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
come after you and just hit the Cyclops

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.279 
come after you and just hit the Cyclops
a<00:00:57.570> couple<00:00:58.320> times<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.739> then<00:00:58.859> run<00:00:59.039> away<00:01:00.170> keep<00:01:01.170> in

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
a couple times and then run away keep in

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.139 
a couple times and then run away keep in
mind<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> Cyclops<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.280> also<00:01:02.399> grab<00:01:02.939> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
mind that the Cyclops can also grab the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.899 
mind that the Cyclops can also grab the
boars<00:01:03.359> himself<00:01:03.839> and<00:01:04.110> throw<00:01:04.500> them<00:01:04.649> at<00:01:04.799> you

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
boars himself and throw them at you

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.320 
boars himself and throw them at you
which<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.149> do<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> lot<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.630> damage<00:01:06.899> to<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:08.330> so

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
which can do a lot of damage to you so

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.499 
which can do a lot of damage to you so
you<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> watch<00:01:09.899> out<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.029 

as<00:01:16.509> soon<00:01:17.140> as<00:01:17.229> you<00:01:17.320> get<00:01:17.409> him<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:17.950> circle<00:01:20.039> he's

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
as soon as you get him to a circle he's

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:28.850 
as soon as you get him to a circle he's
almost<00:01:21.429> dead

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.310 

you<00:01:29.860> have<00:01:30.009> to<00:01:30.159> get<00:01:30.280> them<00:01:30.399> to<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.549> circle<00:01:30.969> twice

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you have to get them to the circle twice

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.440 
you have to get them to the circle twice
and<00:01:32.369> if<00:01:33.369> you've<00:01:33.850> already<00:01:34.060> played<00:01:34.180> through<00:01:34.390> the
