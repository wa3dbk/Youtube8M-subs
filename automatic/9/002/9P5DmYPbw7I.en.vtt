these<00:00:22.400> are<00:00:22.610> all<00:00:22.790> replicas<00:00:23.450> so<00:00:24.140> that's<00:00:24.980> off

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
these are all replicas so that's off

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:35.080 
these are all replicas so that's off
right<00:00:26.960> off<00:00:27.079> the<00:00:27.200> bat<00:00:27.349> okay<00:00:32.710> there<00:00:33.710> you<00:00:33.739> go<00:00:34.090> the

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:01:01.750 

oh<00:00:52.089> really<00:00:53.089> good<00:00:56.949> see<00:00:58.329> no<00:00:59.329> glue<00:01:00.460> just<00:01:01.460> here<00:01:01.730> a

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
oh really good see no glue just here a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.689 
oh really good see no glue just here a
bit<00:01:02.089> of<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.629> bit<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.559> plastic<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:04.190> glue<00:01:04.430> here

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
bit of a bit of plastic and glue here

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.770 
bit of a bit of plastic and glue here
but<00:01:04.970> that's<00:01:05.570> really<00:01:06.290> really<00:01:06.710> really<00:01:06.890> small

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
but that's really really really small

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.730 
but that's really really really small
nothing<00:01:08.780> there<00:01:09.520> now<00:01:10.520> these<00:01:10.729> are<00:01:11.740> handmade<00:01:14.740> so

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
nothing there now these are handmade so

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.710 
nothing there now these are handmade so
that's<00:01:15.950> why<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.700> get<00:01:16.820> some<00:01:17.060> replicas<00:01:17.509> which

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
that's why you get some replicas which

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.499 
that's why you get some replicas which
are<00:01:17.899> really<00:01:18.110> crappy<00:01:18.680> which<00:01:19.299> they're<00:01:20.299> not

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
are really crappy which they're not

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.359 
are really crappy which they're not
handmade<00:01:21.350> they're<00:01:21.829> all<00:01:22.450> popped<00:01:23.450> in<00:01:23.689> a<00:01:23.750> machine

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
handmade they're all popped in a machine

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.830 
handmade they're all popped in a machine
the<00:01:25.369> machine<00:01:25.670> doesn't<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.149> glue<00:01:26.390> comes<00:01:26.630> out

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
the machine doesn't so glue comes out

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.249 
the machine doesn't so glue comes out
but<00:01:27.079> my<00:01:27.320> uncle's<00:01:27.680> company<00:01:27.890> actually<00:01:28.250> does

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
but my uncle's company actually does

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.020 
but my uncle's company actually does
every<00:01:30.259> single<00:01:30.409> pair<00:01:30.710> by<00:01:30.860> hand<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.729> make<00:01:31.880> sure

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
every single pair by hand to make sure

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.429 
every single pair by hand to make sure
that<00:01:32.240> there's<00:01:32.509> no<00:01:32.659> glue<00:01:32.899> and<00:01:33.049> if<00:01:33.140> there<00:01:33.320> is

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
that there's no glue and if there is

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.300 
that there's no glue and if there is
glue<00:01:34.299> it's<00:01:35.299> an<00:01:35.450> off<00:01:35.570> day<00:01:35.840> for<00:01:36.140> them<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.189> it's

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
glue it's an off day for them so it's

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.389 
glue it's an off day for them so it's
really<00:01:37.490> rare<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:38.060> moving<00:01:38.659> on<00:01:38.810> now<00:01:39.399> obviously
