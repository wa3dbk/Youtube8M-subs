i<00:01:21.060> came<00:01:21.299> across<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:21.810> nonetheless<00:01:22.070> what<00:01:23.070> can

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
i came across but nonetheless what can

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.399 
i came across but nonetheless what can
you<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.420> advanced<00:01:24.900> humans<00:01:25.259> well

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.920 
you do with these advanced humans well
what<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.689> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.720> actually

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
what you can do is you can actually

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.450 
what you can do is you can actually
trade<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.590> them<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:28.950> you're<00:01:29.130> not<00:01:29.250> using

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
trade with them but you're not using

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.880 
trade with them but you're not using
emeralds<00:01:30.150> you're<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.900> using<00:01:31.110> money

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
emeralds you're going to be using money

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
emeralds you're going to be using money
as<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.490> guys<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.820> see<00:01:32.880> i<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.299> rub<00:01:34.049> their

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
as you guys can see i like rub their

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.450 
as you guys can see i like rub their
bank<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.860> stuff<00:01:36.590> but<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.369> actually

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
bank and stuff but you can actually

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.300 
bank and stuff but you can actually
trade<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.720> villagers<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.530> gain<00:01:40.950> money

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
trade with the villagers to gain money

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.389 
trade with the villagers to gain money
so<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.420> way<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.630> basically<00:01:43.399> interacting

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
so it's a way of basically interacting

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.950 
so it's a way of basically interacting
with<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.899> good<00:01:46.110> old<00:01:46.290> humans<00:01:46.890> now<00:01:47.630> in<00:01:48.630> terms<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
with the good old humans now in terms of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.780 
with the good old humans now in terms of
them<00:01:49.170> being<00:01:49.409> advanced<00:01:50.040> humans<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> reason

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
them being advanced humans the reason

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.990 
them being advanced humans the reason
why<00:01:50.909> they're<00:01:51.149> considered<00:01:51.930> advanced<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:53.000> I

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
why they're considered advanced is I

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.749 
why they're considered advanced is I
guess<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.409> trading<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> little<00:01:56.610> bit

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
guess the the trading is a little bit

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.240 
guess the the trading is a little bit
more<00:01:56.939> lenient<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.689> something<00:01:58.200> core<00:01:58.530> they<00:01:59.009> just

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
more lenient or something core they just

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520 
more lenient or something core they just
seem<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.909> more<00:02:00.180> AI<00:02:00.509> than<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> villagers

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
seem to have more AI than the villagers

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.350 
seem to have more AI than the villagers
do<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.040> they<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.549> seem<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> lot<00:02:03.299> more

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
do and they do seem to be a lot more

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.600 
do and they do seem to be a lot more
cleaner<00:02:03.840> than<00:02:04.170> what<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.619> villagers<00:02:05.100> are<00:02:05.250> but

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
cleaner than what the villagers are but

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.999 
cleaner than what the villagers are but
I<00:02:05.790> i<00:02:06.119> I'm<00:02:06.600> actually<00:02:06.780> loving<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.469> skin<00:02:07.590> but

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
