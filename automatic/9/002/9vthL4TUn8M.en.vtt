00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:11.630
Before, I uploaded a video that I played GarageBand Keyboard. Then, someone asked me why my keyboard have no black keys. Well, they are here.

00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:16.670
This is that video. Exactly it has no black keys.

00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:21.930
The reason is "SCALE" function.

00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:31.840
What is the SCALE? A few month before, I told you how to play Okinawa music. That is the SCALE.

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:42.600
For example, Arabic music

00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:49.480
Generally, the scale of Western music is "do re mi fa so la ti do".

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:58.280
In other regions or music categories, there are each scale. The "SCALE" function is able to load them.

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.030
No black keys

00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:08.500
I set this keyboard as the Japanese scale.

00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:20.550
It is like a Japanese traditional songs. And I'm gonna try the minor Blues.

00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:41.950
I am not pretty to play a keyboard. So I used this function to play my song on a live event.

00:01:53.921 --> 00:02:01.840
As you know, the Kaossilator has similar scale function.

00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:14.110
I'm not a goo player. But technology help me. I'm happy to be born in a good time.
