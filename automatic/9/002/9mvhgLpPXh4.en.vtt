00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 a giant book of seven tons is 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.179
 exposed in counting mines general I am 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.179
 more than 40,000 pages on standards 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.019
 published in the last 21 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.900
 years 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.520
 The book is a demonstration of the size of 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.880
 bureaucracy in Brazil 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.460
 expulsion of adolescents not to a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.369
 tourist spot any but the most 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.769
 new attraction of counting a book 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.290
 giant 45 thousand pages a mega collection 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.059
 of tax rules in Brazil 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.840
 last 21 years 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.340
 nearly two per hour there was tax 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.230
 revolted with this reason why both 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.950
 momentum so that we sometimes see 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.399
 No place each page has 270 grams 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.460
 the whole work weighs seven tons 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.989
 equivalent to 13 in the pile of 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.890
 papers are no less than one meter and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.870
 sixty -one tall the reader 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.159
 excited to devote 10 hours all 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.210
 The days will take 35 years to reach 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.570
 last page 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.250
 someone is applying for the grandeur of 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.670
 work impresses even the most experienced 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.049
 in the branch has one day imagined publishing the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.390
 book greater than the lady never is 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.490
 a work so huge that it had to be 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.880
 written on huge sheets 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 if the page size were to be decreased 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.060
 it would give numerous volumes about 1000 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.490
 1200 books 1 200 volumes 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.579
 so that's why I opted for the page 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.579
 to be displayed on the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.649
 moment the advantage is that the reader will 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.850
 need glasses and do not need 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.220
 works in which place of the world the author 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.770
 need a ladder to climb in 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.380
 own creation Brazil with this 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.990
 became the largest exporter of 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.860
 The book's bureaucracy is not for 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.320
 to be sold 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.869
 will only be exposed as proof of the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.679
 size of the bureaucracy in the country 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.739
 if all the pages were rolled 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.750
 1 100 kilometers of paper the history of 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.480
 Giant book is already over 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.450
 others can still be written and 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.879
 maybe a happy ending we can 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.689
 see a world of other eyes that people 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.689
 you can change a
