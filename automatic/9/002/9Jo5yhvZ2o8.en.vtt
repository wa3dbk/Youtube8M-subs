00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
to Chandlers is mounted on the camera

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.279 
to Chandlers is mounted on the camera
itself<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:46.700> I'm<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> quick

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
itself so I'm just going to do a quick

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.330 
itself so I'm just going to do a quick
comparisons<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> size<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:53.010> see

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
comparisons of the size and you can see

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
comparisons of the size and you can see
here<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:54.570> quite<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> lot<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.110> difference

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
here it's quite a lot of difference

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.950 
here it's quite a lot of difference
actually<00:00:56.360> let<00:00:57.360> me<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.899> quickly<00:00:59.449> and<00:01:00.449> attach

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
actually let me just quickly and attach

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
actually let me just quickly and attach
this<00:01:01.230> first<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:05.750> quick<00:01:06.750> look<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.820> course

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
this first and quick look and of course

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.469 
this first and quick look and of course
I<00:01:10.909> think<00:01:11.909> both<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.930> plastic<00:01:13.560> beaut

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
I think both of this is a plastic beaut

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.539 
I think both of this is a plastic beaut
beauty<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.320> obviously<00:01:16.560> has<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> much

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
beauty but this obviously has a much

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.200 
beauty but this obviously has a much
better<00:01:17.820> quality<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.710> lot<00:01:19.979> heavier<00:01:20.729> I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
better quality and it's a lot heavier I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.649 
better quality and it's a lot heavier I
would<00:01:21.810> say<00:01:21.930> about<00:01:22.110> 400<00:01:22.439> gram<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.390> this<00:01:24.390> is

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
would say about 400 gram and this is

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
would say about 400 gram and this is
probably<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.259> 100<00:01:25.979> gram<00:01:26.159> or<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.689> then<00:01:29.000> here

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
probably like 100 gram or so then here

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.960 
probably like 100 gram or so then here
as<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.259> see<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.770> almost<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:33.860> modern

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
as you can see it's almost like a modern

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.440 
as you can see it's almost like a modern
half<00:01:36.619> more<00:01:37.619> than<00:01:38.689> 1/2<00:01:39.689> times<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.229> size<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:42.000> 18

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
half more than 1/2 times the size the 18

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.710 
half more than 1/2 times the size the 18
to<00:01:42.600> turn<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.079> more<00:01:43.110> than<00:01:44.119> two<00:01:45.119> times<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.479> size

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
to turn is more than two times the size

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.069 
to turn is more than two times the size
of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.560> kit<00:01:46.799> lens<00:01:48.170> for<00:01:49.170> Bob<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:51.479> has<00:01:51.780> a

zoom<00:03:32.890> which<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.400> times<00:03:33.760> 2<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.870> there's<00:03:41.769> the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
zoom which is times 2 and there's the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.530 
zoom which is times 2 and there's the
close<00:03:42.190> as<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.459> can<00:03:42.580> get<00:03:42.790> on<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:44.019> Claire<00:03:44.260> zoom

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
close as you can get on the Claire zoom

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:57.509 
close as you can get on the Claire zoom
also<00:03:46.890> switch<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:48.069> off<00:03:49.440> press<00:03:50.440> back<00:03:50.709> on<00:03:56.519> and

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
also switch it off press back on and

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.150 
also switch it off press back on and
then<00:03:57.819> we'll<00:03:57.850> take<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.510> look<00:03:59.489> with<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:01.950> 18<00:04:02.950> to

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
then we'll take a look with the 18 to

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.990 
then we'll take a look with the 18 to
200<00:04:03.819> L<00:04:04.500> versions<00:04:06.930> let's<00:04:07.930> see<00:04:08.910> what<00:04:09.910> the

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
200 L versions let's see what the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.890 
200 L versions let's see what the
closest<00:04:10.450> we<00:04:10.569> can<00:04:10.750> get

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.939 

all<00:04:15.440> right<00:04:15.530> so<00:04:15.680> this<00:04:15.890> is<00:04:17.109> okay<00:04:18.109> so<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:18.620> can<00:04:18.799> see

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
all right so this is okay so you can see

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:27.760 
all right so this is okay so you can see
here<00:04:19.160> this<00:04:19.340> at<00:04:19.669> 200<00:04:20.329> millimeter<00:04:20.750> oh<00:04:26.680> there's<00:04:27.680> a

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
here this at 200 millimeter oh there's a

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.850 
here this at 200 millimeter oh there's a
lot<00:04:30.880> there's<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:32.000> lot<00:04:32.030> longer<00:04:32.510> when<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:33.620> zoom

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
lot there's a lot longer when you zoom

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.379 
lot there's a lot longer when you zoom
in<00:04:34.040> in<00:04:34.220> all<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.460> way<00:04:34.639> to<00:04:34.699> 200<00:04:35.500> sideway<00:04:36.530> 200<00:04:37.430> was

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
in in all the way to 200 sideway 200 was

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:45.189 
in in all the way to 200 sideway 200 was
the<00:04:38.540> closest<00:04:42.760> all<00:04:43.760> right<00:04:43.880> so<00:04:44.060> this<00:04:44.300> is<00:04:44.600> the

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
the closest all right so this is the

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.230 
the closest all right so this is the
closest<00:04:45.710> at<00:04:45.949> 200<00:04:46.550> millimeter<00:04:46.940> on<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.180> fan<00:04:48.940> if<00:04:49.940> we

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
closest at 200 millimeter on a fan if we

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:59.170 
closest at 200 millimeter on a fan if we
clear<00:04:50.570> zoom<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:52.070> can<00:04:52.100> replace<00:04:52.639> them<00:04:52.850> though<00:04:58.180> I

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
clear zoom you can replace them though I

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.909 
clear zoom you can replace them though I
don't<00:04:59.539> think<00:04:59.780> I<00:05:00.850> did<00:05:01.850> say<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.389> reason<00:05:03.229> yeah

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
don't think I did say the reason yeah

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.070 
don't think I did say the reason yeah
anyway<00:05:04.630> doesn't<00:05:05.630> matter

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
anyway doesn't matter

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.060 
anyway doesn't matter
I<00:05:07.270> guess<00:05:08.270> there's<00:05:08.630> pretty<00:05:09.080> much<00:05:09.199> it<00:05:09.380> it's<00:05:09.949> a

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
I guess there's pretty much it it's a

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.219 
I guess there's pretty much it it's a
very<00:05:10.310> quick<00:05:10.520> and<00:05:10.789> short<00:05:11.000> comparison<00:05:11.660> of<00:05:11.870> a

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
very quick and short comparison of a

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.020 
very quick and short comparison of a
kick<00:05:13.100> lens<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.639> new<00:05:14.630> kids<00:05:14.900> learn<00:05:15.139> with<00:05:15.320> ponzu
