00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.739
 good afternoon hello maria you have 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.230
 returned to childhood to three 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.050
 generations already if we are lucky enough to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.430
 have grandpa the father who was the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.140
 we saw on television and has 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.300
 on of those songs and the boy 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.460
 small you already know the songs and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.019
 now he comes to know us theater yes 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.239
 because they come to the theater from 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.460
 this Saturday we're going to see the musical 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.650
 of the TV clowns how are they 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.140
 you counting a little roll by 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.229
 example of what this good musical is about 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.120
 this musical is such a novelty so 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.530
 great that we believe that up 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.549
 that we do not finish the first function 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.750
 we are going to believe what we are 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.420
 doing 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.150
 the mix of the great ones is fantastic 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.800
 hits the big sketches that have 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.170
 marked the trajectory of the 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.360
 family all that well brought to how there is 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.910
 than to bring it today with agility 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.520
 that the child has is not the same 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.720
 so many years ago but well I think that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.880
 that is currently of all the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.580
 computer theme we have this in mind 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.320
 the very complete scenario is a is something 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.300
 different than what we have done all the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.509
 life and that you should not miss or parents 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.490
 no children nobody will enjoy it I am 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.320
 saying really the child is going to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.600
 Bieber has a lot going to know a 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.540
 new fofito a new roller a new 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.670
 Monica 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.760
 and the father is going to fall 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.600
 tears because there are very moments 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.490
 sentimental that they will remember 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.290
 those programs that they watched but all 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.810
 this the important thing is that they know that they are going 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.490
 to see something different, good, Monica 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.220
 I want you to incite these two clowns 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.530
 to get fired in a way that 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.510
 you will love all the children you 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.370
 you know how in the only way that 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.890
 we know how to make a vein but we 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.890
 everyone looking over there and it's like
