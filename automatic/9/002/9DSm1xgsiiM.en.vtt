00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.860 
thing is kind of stuck behind that now
so<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.840> really<00:02:33.170> isn't<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.440> good<00:02:33.620> sign<00:02:34.870> motor

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
so that really isn't a good sign motor

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.940 
so that really isn't a good sign motor
could<00:02:36.110> be<00:02:36.290> stuffed

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
could be stuffed

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.110 
could be stuffed
I<00:02:38.200> hope<00:02:39.200> not<00:02:39.440> though<00:02:39.709> is<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:40.549> used<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:40.970> be

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
I hope not though is this used to be

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.960 
I hope not though is this used to be
like<00:02:41.150> down<00:02:41.569> maybe<00:02:41.900> it's<00:02:42.080> just<00:02:42.170> because<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.970> mean

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
like down maybe it's just because I mean

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.339 
like down maybe it's just because I mean
I<00:02:44.090> don't<00:02:44.150> know<00:02:44.360> maybe<00:02:44.780> it's<00:02:45.049> just<00:02:45.140> because

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
I don't know maybe it's just because

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.520 
I don't know maybe it's just because
this<00:02:46.090> intake<00:02:47.090> box<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.720> tweaked<00:02:48.080> up<00:02:48.260> or

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
this intake box is tweaked up or

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.020 
this intake box is tweaked up or
something<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:48.980> hope<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.280> motor<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.670> stuff

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
something I hope the motor is the stuff

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.280 
something I hope the motor is the stuff
back<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:51.760> know<00:02:52.760> hope<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.239> truck<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.810> hope

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
back you know hope the truck is and hope

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.589 
back you know hope the truck is and hope
the<00:02:54.440> motor<00:02:54.650> isn't<00:02:54.890> tweaked<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.390> motor

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
the motor isn't tweaked like the motor

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.259 
the motor isn't tweaked like the motor
mounts<00:02:56.989> or<00:02:57.110> anything<00:02:57.319> I<00:02:57.910> mean<00:02:58.910> looks<00:02:59.090> like

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
mounts or anything I mean looks like

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.319 
mounts or anything I mean looks like
it's<00:02:59.450> sitting<00:02:59.569> straight<00:03:00.049> with<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.829> truck

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
it's sitting straight with the truck

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.890 
it's sitting straight with the truck
can't<00:03:02.329> really<00:03:02.510> tell<00:03:02.660> though<00:03:02.780> because

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
can't really tell though because

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.830 
can't really tell though because
everything's<00:03:03.260> been<00:03:03.560> but<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:05.660> sucks<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.500> know
