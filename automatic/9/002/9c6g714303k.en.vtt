00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.549
 hello to all of you people spoonful of cream and 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.709
 today I would like to do for you 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:16.400
 review i want to share my opinion on 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:19.070
 new products from sigma new onliner i 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.720
 I know that very rarely do I review 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.419
 I try to make a review of exactly those 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.880
 products that surprised me exactly on 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.770
 those products about which you have 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.390
 I really hope to tell you 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.890
 today will be equally interesting and useful 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.290
 so let's get down to 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.780
 I probably would like to note that 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.629
 sigma recently actively pro 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.820
 mattes your makeup as many brushes 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.640
 how many cosmetics they have is huge 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.489
 line of colors and shadows because 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.429
 now they have released oh liners this 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.499
 pencils and in fact I think that 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.699
 it is great for them that 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:57.170
 the pencils came out excellent bright and 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.940
 probably the needs of many girls who 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.159
 use bright color pencils 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.649
 for the eyes they state that 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.500
 pencils on the texture is very rich 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.110
 cream and they are long playing i can 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.250
 say about not very very saturated they 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.290
 pleasant and creamy textures and they 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.900
 long-playing but only those who team 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.270
 hands features for these on the hell liner and those 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.400
 faster he will dismount and run away from your 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.380
 Makeup Sasha eye on you liners 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.930
 which is dark here is dark brown 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.360
 I tried to put black on his arm 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.910
 then I grind my hand when i wake up 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.560
 i had such a slight shade then 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.110
 I understood everything where was on my hand 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.390
 pencil meaning they are really long 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.480
 playing they really long 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.640
 hold onto your makeup and so now 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.530
 probably want to tell a little bit 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.230
 how do they present their 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.170
 pencils and if you will be ordered 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.600
 it is a set of pencils they have three 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.120
 the set there are three colors it 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.480
 neutral warm and cold here to me 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.210
 got so cold add everyone 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.680
 to ours they have a brush in the cold 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.330
 gamma is a pencil pencil 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.460
 warm comet is so small 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.410
 short brush for shading my 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.560
 mad darling adore and brush and 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.810
 neutral komi more rounded too 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.390
 thick brush to the tournament on creativity 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.430
 caps but i don't really use in general 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.099
 In principle, this is such a good bonus by 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.920
 about the price of one pencil is worth 9 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.079
 dollars and a set costs 33 dollars per 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.510
 Basically it's not so cheap but I think 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.150
 what a worthwhile price now I will tell a bunch 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.060
 degrees look like this 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.819
 special but what's the main plus which 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.889
 he noticed very heavy meaning you 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.389
 you will not have a feeling in your hands that you 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.969
 hold something weightless 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:46.430
 and the harder the pencil seems to me 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.829
 easier to understand where you lead your 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.780
 pencil arrow and don't look as if 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.760
 would they be wooden but nevertheless can 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.459
 even be made with plastic but 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.739
 under sharpening their very, very easily the most 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.959
 a big plus that I see in these 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.489
 pencils it their shade it them 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.069
 saturation is what they really are 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.810
 very beautiful shades 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.870
 fit it seems to me absolutely under any 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.969
 appearance let me show you some 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.430
 swatches you yourself will understand you need these 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.560
 Reni pencils and at first pencil without 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.269
 which of course is called boost anywhere 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.180
 this is a regular black pencil 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.129
 very saturated very bright that is to them 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.900
 need to work carefully enough 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.540
 because I have days and you can 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.760
 if there is not a very clever and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.620
 very cleverly paints arrows either 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.790
 bring your eyes then you can a little bit 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.859
 use your makeup 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.629
 but a huge plus will become a pencil and 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.510
 In general, all these pencils that they 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.489
 very easy to shade 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.360
 shade balance i would call it not beat 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.100
 he is associated with 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.880
 on his chocolate that is natural 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.950
 such deep milk chocolate is very 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.900
 beautiful will look great on 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.930
 brunettes will look very nice 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.640
 on blonde his malaga can 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.190
 use as the bottom line of growth 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.380

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.910

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.740
 use also for summer makeup 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.740
 along the upper lash line 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:10.070
 very cool this little shimmer gives 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.320
 this shade of intelligence next 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.810

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.600

 very deep in it is present 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.580

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.400
 shade to sum up the bottom line 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.320

 the color will suit perfectly the next shade 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.000
 which is called alpha one of my 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.180
 most loved he bright saturated he

 It will look very nice on 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:44.909
 the lower lash line seems to me 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.889
 will bind absolutely any makeup if you 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.439

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.300

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.009
 from sigma 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.419
 they promise that this collection will be 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:24.240
 constantly it on their website can 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:27.120
 I will probably look at studying 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.069
 many videos appear about these 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.020
 oh liners i'll absolutely them 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.449
 use your make up something 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.729
 new something interesting beautiful 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.419
 very rich colors i like very much 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.319
 when 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:43.020
 both shadows and time catchers say how 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:45.029
 shadows and pencil unsaturated they 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.009
 very pigmented immediately see what

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.870
 buy should he not buy 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.969
 it follows that he will fit more what he 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.219
 fit less if you have some 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:01.050
