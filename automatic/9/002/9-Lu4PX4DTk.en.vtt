actually when I was drafted back in 2001
they<00:00:32.669> were<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.940> team<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.329> thought<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> was

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
they were the team that I thought I was

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.540

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
going to be drafted by with I think it

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.160 
going to be drafted by with I think it
was<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> 26th<00:00:36.329> pick<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> draft<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
was the 26th pick in the draft at the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.740 
was the 26th pick in the draft at the
time<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:38.160> passed<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.610> me<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.120> who

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
time and they passed on me then and who

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.360 
time and they passed on me then and who
would<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:39.989> thought<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.829> five

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
would have thought that you know five

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.619 
would have thought that you know five
years<00:00:41.579> later<00:00:41.670> they'd<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.180> another<00:00:42.420> chance

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
years later they'd have another chance

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.150 
years later they'd have another chance
for<00:00:42.750> free<00:00:42.960> agency<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.040> all

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

you<00:03:43.000> know<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.209> was<00:03:43.299> probably<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.600> best<00:03:43.840> thing

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930
