00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.470 

critical<00:00:10.889> focus<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.490> play<00:00:11.670> there's<00:00:12.059> lots

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
critical focus is in play there's lots

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.600 
critical focus is in play there's lots
of<00:00:12.750> different<00:00:13.170> pieces<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:13.950> might<00:00:14.429> need

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
of different pieces that you might need

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.550 
of different pieces that you might need
to<00:00:14.670> integrate<00:00:15.030> into<00:00:15.540> your<00:00:15.570> kit<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.139> into<00:00:16.440> your

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
to integrate into your kit and into your

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.859 
to integrate into your kit and into your
technique<00:00:17.039> but<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:17.970> my<00:00:18.210> favorite

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
technique but one of my favorite

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.240 
technique but one of my favorite
techniques<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.590> getting<00:00:19.650> critical<00:00:20.039> focus

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
techniques for getting critical focus

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.500 
techniques for getting critical focus
rich<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.760> actually<00:00:21.060> probably<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> most

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
rich is actually probably the most

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.870 
rich is actually probably the most
simple<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.170> simply<00:00:22.920> zooming<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
simple and that simply zooming in on the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.939 
simple and that simply zooming in on the
sensor<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> 1<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.289> 1<00:00:25.320> pixel<00:00:25.710> display

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
sensor so I get a 1 to 1 pixel display

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.220 
sensor so I get a 1 to 1 pixel display
back<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.000> my<00:00:27.090> LCD<00:00:27.449> or<00:00:27.480> back<00:00:27.869> out<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.170> my

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
back here on my LCD or back out to my

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.960 
back here on my LCD or back out to my
external<00:00:28.439> monitoring<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.519> you've<00:00:29.760> used

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
external monitoring now if you've used

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.120 
external monitoring now if you've used
professional<00:00:30.689> video<00:00:30.960> lenses<00:00:31.470> you're<00:00:31.800> kind<00:00:32.040> of

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
professional video lenses you're kind of

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.280 
professional video lenses you're kind of
used<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.430> zooming<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> lens<00:00:33.750> setting

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
used to zooming in the lens setting

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.170 
used to zooming in the lens setting
focus<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.860> zooming<00:00:35.160> back<00:00:35.309> out<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.149> that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
focus and zooming back out but that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.299 
focus and zooming back out but that
doesn't<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.719> work<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.230> DSLR<00:00:37.680> lenses<00:00:38.129> right

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
doesn't really work on DSLR lenses right

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.580 
doesn't really work on DSLR lenses right
right<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> cameras<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.440> going

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
right and so a lot of cameras are going

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.590 
right and so a lot of cameras are going
to<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> zoom<00:00:41.160> function<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
to have a zoom function when what this

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.479 
to have a zoom function when what this
allows<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.500> sort<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.950> crop<00:00:44.250> into

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
allows you to do is sort of crop into

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.770 
allows you to do is sort of crop into
the<00:00:44.670> sensor<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.180> you're<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.570> much

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the sensor so you're going to get a much

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.229 
the sensor so you're going to get a much
more<00:00:46.680> zoomed<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.280> view<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> more<00:00:47.910> one-to-one

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
more zoomed in view a more one-to-one

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.029 
more zoomed in view a more one-to-one
pixelview<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.710> help<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
pixelview and that's going to help you

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.529 
pixelview and that's going to help you
set<00:00:50.280> critical<00:00:50.640> focus<00:00:50.760> let<00:00:51.090> me<00:00:51.180> show<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.420> what

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
set critical focus let me show you what

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
set critical focus let me show you what
I<00:00:51.570> mean<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> shot<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
I mean so here on the shot we have it

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.040 
I mean so here on the shot we have it
sort<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.879> set<00:00:54.090> normally<00:00:54.480> right<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.809> kind<00:00:55.020> of

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
sort of set normally right it's kind of

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.720 
sort of set normally right it's kind of
a<00:00:55.140> medium<00:00:55.469> close-up<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.370> want<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.610> make

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
a medium close-up but I want to make

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.549 
a medium close-up but I want to make
sure<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.000> i<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.239> actually<00:00:57.600> type<00:00:58.140> focus

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
sure that i have actually type focus

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.830 
sure that i have actually type focus
well<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.309> looked<00:00:59.699> good<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.180> well<00:01:00.600> yeah<00:01:00.809> of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
click on the zoom in button here on my

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
click on the zoom in button here on my
canon<00:01:06.780> 7d<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.040> do<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.430> you'll

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
canon 7d and when I do that you'll

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.030 
canon 7d and when I do that you'll
notice<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:09.630> zoomed<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.500> one

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
notice that I get zoomed in here and one

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.530 
notice that I get zoomed in here and one
of<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> things<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.000> find

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
of the things I like to do is find

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.780 
of the things I like to do is find
features<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> person<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> nose<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
features of the person like the nose the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
features of the person like the nose the
mouth<00:01:15.000> maybe<00:01:15.840> we'll<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> talent<00:01:16.470> smile

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
mouth maybe we'll have the talent smile

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
mouth maybe we'll have the talent smile
a<00:01:16.770> little<00:01:17.130> bit<00:01:17.250> right<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.240> get<00:01:18.420> some<00:01:18.600> sharp

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
a little bit right and get some sharp

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.380 
a little bit right and get some sharp
defined<00:01:19.590> edges<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.640> once<00:01:20.909> you've<00:01:21.030> gotten<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
defined edges and once you've gotten to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.999 
defined edges and once you've gotten to
those<00:01:21.540> points<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.500> when<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:22.950> start

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
those points that's when you can start

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.429 
those points that's when you can start
playing<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.670> focus<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.360> making<00:01:25.170> sure<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
playing with focus and making sure that

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.980 
playing with focus and making sure that
you<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.220> spot<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.700> something<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you have it spot on something like that

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.050 
you have it spot on something like that
kind<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.320> works<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:29.070> right<00:01:29.280> now<00:01:29.460> you'll

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
kind of works now right now you'll

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.300 
kind of works now right now you'll
notice<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.390> I'm<00:01:30.600> zoomed<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:31.020> times<00:01:31.500> 5<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
notice that I'm zoomed in times 5 I

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.149 
notice that I'm zoomed in times 5 I
click<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.119> again<00:01:33.420> okay<00:01:34.350> well<00:01:34.619> now<00:01:34.950> I'm

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
click on that again okay well now I'm
