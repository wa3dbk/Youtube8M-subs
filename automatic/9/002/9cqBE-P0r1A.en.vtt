00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
a video for you about the new boost

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.240 
a video for you about the new boost
gauge<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.290> have<00:00:10.469> installed<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:12.980> his<00:00:13.980> high

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
gauge that I have installed and his high

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.519 
gauge that I have installed and his high
goes<00:00:14.580> my<00:00:15.059> problem<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.900> don't<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.170> enough

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
goes my problem is I don't have enough

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.150 
goes my problem is I don't have enough
pressure<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:17.720> in<00:00:18.720> my<00:00:18.930> turbo<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:21.080> apparently

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
pressure in in my turbo and apparently

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.230 
pressure in in my turbo and apparently
my<00:00:23.160> boost<00:00:23.400> gauge<00:00:23.580> goes<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.300> me<00:00:25.910> maximum<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.800> 0.5

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
my boost gauge goes on me maximum to 0.5

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.970 
my boost gauge goes on me maximum to 0.5

I'm<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.430> tonight<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:33.870> tasting<00:00:34.200> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
I'm just so tonight as I was tasting it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.020 
I'm just so tonight as I was tasting it
so<00:00:34.590> before<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> want<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:36.110> tell<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.230> anything<00:00:38.030> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
show you how I did so here's my pipes

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.530 
show you how I did so here's my pipes
connected<00:00:59.030> this<00:01:03.210> thing<00:01:03.449> was<00:01:03.930> cold

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
connected this thing was cold

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.740 
connected this thing was cold
yeah<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.869> here's<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:08.280> original<00:01:08.580> pipe<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
yeah and here's the original pipe that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.719 
yeah and here's the original pipe that
goes<00:01:09.780> from<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> smart<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.340> see<00:01:11.549> it's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
goes from the smart as you can see it's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.880 
goes from the smart as you can see it's
all<00:01:11.909> connected<00:01:12.090> HP's<00:01:12.720> GPS<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.710> have

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
all connected HP's GPS and I have

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.030 
all connected HP's GPS and I have
secured<00:01:14.369> everything<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.090> there's<00:01:15.270> no<00:01:15.479> leaks

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
secured everything so there's no leaks

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.969 
secured everything so there's no leaks
here's<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.220> same<00:01:17.460> thing<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.880> well<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.479> this

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
here's the same thing as well but this

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
here's the same thing as well but this
this<00:01:19.979> cable<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.549> connected<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:24.150> vacuum

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
this cable is connected to this vacuum

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.200 
this cable is connected to this vacuum
hose<00:01:24.960> connected<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> boost<00:01:26.790> gauge<00:01:27.020> that's

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.550 

its<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> wires<00:01:36.560> connected

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
its this is just the wires connected

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.490 
its this is just the wires connected
heads<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.520> saw<00:01:38.670> your<00:01:38.850> email<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.450> now<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
heads as I saw your email just now so

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.800 
heads as I saw your email just now so
yep<00:01:41.070> okay<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:41.880> go<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.210> here's<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.630> boost

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
yep okay here we go and here's the boost

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.660 
yep okay here we go and here's the boost
gauge<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:45.420> problem<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.670> something

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
gauge the problem is I have something

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.530 
gauge the problem is I have something
about<00:01:48.560> I've<00:01:49.560> seen<00:01:49.799> two<00:01:50.270> two<00:01:51.270> or<00:01:52.130> three<00:01:53.540> maybe

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
about I've seen two two or three maybe

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.200 
about I've seen two two or three maybe
five<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.530> don't<00:01:56.040> know<00:01:57.680> first<00:01:58.680> gear<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.759> was<00:01:59.969> give

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
five I don't know first gear it was give

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.999 
five I don't know first gear it was give
me<00:02:00.390> he<00:02:00.869> was<00:02:01.020> giving<00:02:01.200> me<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:02.009> down<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.740> all<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
me he was giving me just down to all the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.000 
me he was giving me just down to all the
time<00:02:05.250> below<00:02:05.610> zero<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.590> if<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.759> it's

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
turbo leaks where is the vacuum leaks

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.700 
turbo leaks where is the vacuum leaks
over<00:02:14.230> let's<00:02:14.590> call<00:02:14.860> over<00:02:15.640> pressure<00:02:16.060> leaks<00:02:18.210> and

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
over let's call over pressure leaks and

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.710 
over let's call over pressure leaks and
yeah<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:21.070> don't<00:02:21.310> know<00:02:21.490> if<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.240> help<00:02:22.390> me<00:02:22.600> yes
