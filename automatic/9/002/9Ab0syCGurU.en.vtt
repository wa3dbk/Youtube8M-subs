00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.639 
we're not going to get into all that now
let's<00:01:51.540> actually<00:01:51.720> look<00:01:51.930> at<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.200> camera<00:01:52.560> itself

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
let's actually look at the camera itself

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.499 
let's actually look at the camera itself
so<00:01:53.250> here's<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> camera<00:01:53.939> let's<00:01:54.090> take<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.390> out

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
so here's the camera let's take it out

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.819 
so here's the camera let's take it out
of<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:56.070> box<00:01:56.310> slides<00:01:57.119> right<00:01:57.240> over<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:57.829> and

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
of the box slides right over there and

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.020 
of the box slides right over there and
let's<00:01:59.130> take<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> plastic<00:01:59.579> off<00:01:59.850> either

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
let's take the plastic off either

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.270 
let's take the plastic off either
there's<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.509> front<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
there's the front of it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.080 
there's the front of it
looks<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.520> got<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> lot<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.850> buttons

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
looks like it's got a lot of buttons

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.090 
looks like it's got a lot of buttons
actually<00:02:03.540> no<00:02:04.410> no<00:02:04.470> that's<00:02:04.680> water<00:02:04.950> droplets

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
actually no no that's water droplets

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.650 
actually no no that's water droplets
flutter<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.460> of<00:02:08.550> there<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.540> got

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
flutter it out of there and it's got

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.260 
flutter it out of there and it's got
some<00:02:09.810> plastic<00:02:10.260> over<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> screen<00:02:11.060> all<00:02:12.060> right

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
some plastic over the screen all right

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.510 
some plastic over the screen all right
so<00:02:12.450> there<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.230> kodak<00:02:13.590> playsport<00:02:13.710> looks

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
so there is the kodak playsport looks

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.420 
so there is the kodak playsport looks
pretty<00:02:14.730> nice<00:02:15.170> let's<00:02:16.170> go<00:02:16.320> ahead<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.950> look<00:02:17.370> at

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
pretty nice let's go ahead and look at

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.670 
pretty nice let's go ahead and look at
some<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.880> buttons<00:02:18.200> let's<00:02:19.200> say<00:02:19.320> we<00:02:19.470> got<00:02:19.650> a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
some of the buttons let's say we got a

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
that is where the battery goes so let's

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.530 
that is where the battery goes so let's
go<00:02:55.890> ahead<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.160> put<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.700> battery<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.330> turn

this thing on okay so it's right in walk

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.479 
this thing on okay so it's right in walk
and<00:03:02.610> then<00:03:02.940> close<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.570> up<00:03:03.600> lock<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:04.920> there

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
and then close that up lock it and there

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.280 
and then close that up lock it and there
we<00:03:05.580> go<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:06.180> as<00:03:06.300> returning<00:03:06.630> someone<00:03:07.050> wants<00:03:07.230> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
we go so as returning someone wants to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.870 
we go so as returning someone wants to
read<00:03:07.410> off<00:03:07.560> some<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.890> specs<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.610> thing

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
read off some of the specs of this thing

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.180 
read off some of the specs of this thing
I<00:03:09.120> first<00:03:09.750> off<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.200> underwater<00:03:10.440> camera<00:03:10.680> or

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
I first off is the underwater camera or

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.100 
I first off is the underwater camera or
waterproof<00:03:11.550> camera<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.300> can<00:03:12.330> go<00:03:12.570> up<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.840> 10

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
waterproof camera it can go up to 10

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.800 
waterproof camera it can go up to 10
feet<00:03:13.140> into<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.770> water<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.610> got<00:03:14.850> full<00:03:15.209> 1080p

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
feet into the water it's got full 1080p

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.009 
feet into the water it's got full 1080p
HD<00:03:15.989> video<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.459> also<00:03:17.610> takes<00:03:17.970> 5<00:03:18.300> megapixel

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
HD video and it also takes 5 megapixel

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.620 
HD video and it also takes 5 megapixel
still<00:03:19.350> images<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.310> i<00:03:20.340> guess<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.209> video<00:03:21.480> will

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
still images so i guess the video will

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.110 
still images so i guess the video will
be<00:03:21.720> somewhat<00:03:22.140> around<00:03:22.800> five<00:03:23.010> megapixels<00:03:23.700> also

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
be somewhat around five megapixels also

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.270 
be somewhat around five megapixels also
good<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.140> hit<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.410> on<00:03:25.560> button<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.040> turn<00:03:26.160> it

it<00:03:38.850> set<00:03:39.090> up<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.330> everything<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.870> don't<00:03:40.110> really

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
it set up and everything I don't really

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.509 
it set up and everything I don't really
have<00:03:40.290> much<00:03:40.530> time<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.860> show<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.040> as<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.340> see

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
the battery's low on it so the battery

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.259 
the battery's low on it so the battery
wasn't<00:03:44.070> pre-charged<00:03:44.730> but<00:03:44.910> I'm<00:03:45.000> going<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.180> go
