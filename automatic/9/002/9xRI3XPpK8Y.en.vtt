00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.240 

in<00:02:09.470> my<00:02:09.709> case<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:10.250> will<00:02:10.399> control<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.890> volume<00:02:13.099> and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
in my case I will control the volume and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.600 
in my case I will control the volume and
probe<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:17.150> channels<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.720> my<00:02:17.930> TV<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:22.340> from

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
probe and the channels of my TV so from
