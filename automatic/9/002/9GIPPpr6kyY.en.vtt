00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.370
 America in a stadium of such tradition 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.100
 awesome as is the stadium 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.079
 Aztec so there was no better way than 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.360

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.219

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.890
 fast that three years ago goes up 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.110

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.850

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.149

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.520

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.120

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.570
 well we have also had to pass 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.170
 difficult moments but I think what 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.780
 It has been essential to take those moments 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.390
 in a positive way accept the mistakes 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.760
 have self-criticism and turn the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.020
 page work for the institution and 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.940

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.350
 title as it is a liberating cup 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.530

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.320

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.550

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.940
 have a meeting with gustavo that 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.250
 really he has done a job 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.800
 impressive inside the club is a great 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.000
 idol thread inside the city and we're going to 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.950
 see what 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.930
 which is coming for us next year 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.670
 with this campus since it's going to 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.800
 keep 90 percent of the campus and 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.080
 four or five reinforcements this Monday is 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.540
 to fight the liberators cup yes I 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.220
 I think this team have seen great 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.260
 performances we have seen that plays well 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.709
 to football that is a vertical team that 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.020
 is fast attacking likes the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.180
 people without a doubt that is to fight this 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.790
 cup is complicated we know that the 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.260
 trips the rivals but in the end I have 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.360
 a lot of confidence that we can do 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.770
 well things I have a lot of confidence and 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.840
 gustavo matosas and in the coaching staff 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.360
 it will be a complicated semester for everything 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.610
 this not tournament liberators and the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.660
 calls yes so you have to plan 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.430
 very well 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.220
 those who come have to plan very well 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.610
 the goals that we have to draw 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.860
 and work based on that and finally 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.900
 Jesus does good in the nineties can 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.910
 that little was done was the same pachuca 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.160
 teams that made history maybe 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.989
 dynasties within Mexican football this 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.209
 lion you see it ready to make a 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.440
 dynasty in the next few years and I think 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.320
 that you are missing a lot what you mention 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.120
 necaxa since they were ten incredible years 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.739
 Pachuca Toluca 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.799
 with many titles this is our 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.690
 first that is the most important that I 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.220
 leave quiet but certainly not 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.709
 work for that so your team 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.840
 always be in the first places I 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.610
 I think that this hobby deserves it too 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.459
 say that after ten years of 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.049
 suffering being in the league of promotion 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.449
 filling the stadiums always supporting 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.940
 it's good that now they have this kind of 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.070
 achievements and really we owe ourselves 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.040
 that hobby but what you mention there is 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.900
 that work hard so that for 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.280
 leave this club footprint good that that is 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.139
 well I thank you very much friends of 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.130
