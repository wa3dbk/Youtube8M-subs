right<00:03:56.080> here<00:03:56.380> this<00:03:56.980> is<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.280> fly<00:03:57.820> bar<00:03:58.290> 911<00:03:59.290> where

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
right here this is a fly bar 911 where

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.070 
right here this is a fly bar 911 where
it<00:03:59.560> has<00:03:59.740> the<00:04:00.700> fly<00:04:01.570> bar<00:04:01.810> right<00:04:02.110> here<00:04:03.930> so<00:04:04.930> that's

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
it has the fly bar right here so that's

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.080 
it has the fly bar right here so that's
a<00:04:05.170> pretty<00:04:05.380> nice-looking<00:04:05.740> little<00:04:06.280> helicopter

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
a pretty nice-looking little helicopter

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.970 
a pretty nice-looking little helicopter
there<00:04:09.300> now<00:04:10.300> let's<00:04:10.600> compare<00:04:10.900> sizes<00:04:11.230> between

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
there now let's compare sizes between

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:19.800 
there now let's compare sizes between
the<00:04:12.630> 911<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:15.520> 912

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.740 

and<00:04:20.380> they<00:04:20.620> look<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.829> be<00:04:20.950> exact<00:04:21.489> almost<00:04:22.270> exactly

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
and they look to be exact almost exactly

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.400 
and they look to be exact almost exactly
the<00:04:22.960> same<00:04:23.230> length<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:25.810> one<00:04:25.990> has<00:04:26.139> a<00:04:26.170> much

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
the same length this one has a much

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.080 
the same length this one has a much
bigger<00:04:26.740> motor<00:04:27.130> okay<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:29.169> body<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.620> bigger

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
bigger motor okay and the body is bigger

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.430 
bigger motor okay and the body is bigger
it<00:04:31.090> looks<00:04:31.120> like<00:04:31.419> it's<00:04:31.570> about<00:04:31.690> an<00:04:31.870> inch<00:04:32.020> longer

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
it looks like it's about an inch longer

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.200 
it looks like it's about an inch longer
not<00:04:33.370> very<00:04:33.669> much<00:04:33.940> at<00:04:34.150> all<00:04:35.610> we<00:04:36.610> put<00:04:36.910> a<00:04:36.940> tape

there's a switch flip right here for

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.660 
there's a switch flip right here for
when<00:07:08.390> you<00:07:08.510> want<00:07:08.720> to<00:07:08.810> fly<00:07:09.380> upside<00:07:09.830> down<00:07:10.130> so<00:07:10.490> that

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:10.670 
when you want to fly upside down so that

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.490 
when you want to fly upside down so that
you<00:07:10.820> can<00:07:11.060> control<00:07:11.540> it<00:07:11.780> just<00:07:12.050> like<00:07:12.260> it<00:07:12.470> was

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
you can control it just like it was

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.800 
you can control it just like it was
right-side<00:07:13.130> up<00:07:13.370> because<00:07:14.120> when<00:07:14.330> you're<00:07:14.480> upside

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
right-side up because when you're upside

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.800 
right-side up because when you're upside
down<00:07:15.190> it<00:07:16.190> will<00:07:16.430> turn<00:07:16.700> the<00:07:16.910> opposite<00:07:17.450> direction

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
down it will turn the opposite direction

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.190 
down it will turn the opposite direction
so<00:07:18.050> there<00:07:18.440> is<00:07:18.560> a<00:07:18.590> a<00:07:19.010> switch<00:07:19.820> right<00:07:20.120> here<00:07:20.480> that

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.200 
so there is a a switch right here that

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.070 
so there is a a switch right here that
will<00:07:21.380> allow<00:07:21.710> you<00:07:21.770> to<00:07:22.370> fly<00:07:23.060> upside<00:07:23.540> down<00:07:23.780> just

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 
will allow you to fly upside down just

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.400 
will allow you to fly upside down just
like<00:07:24.260> you're<00:07:24.410> flying<00:07:24.650> normally<00:07:25.400> okay<00:07:26.230> so<00:07:27.230> this

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.410 
like you're flying normally okay so this

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.990

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 
looks like a pretty good package right

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.850 
looks like a pretty good package right
