 hello friends we follow our videos 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.730
 return reports chile we are in the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.260
 ViÃ±a Santa Ema to analyze the turn of 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.330
 italy we meet carlos 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 Oyarzun who is our guest and who 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.610
 will give us details of this third 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.370
 week and end tell us Carlos who 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.070
 comes in this third week that you see in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
 the design of the third week and how 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.640
 as how relationship can you compare 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.339
 regarding the turn of Italy that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.690
 you participated from last year good 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.600
 good morning everyone 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.070
 again good the truth is that this 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.920
 third week only consists of 50 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.290
 5 5 stages then the truth is that already 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.060
 the turn is already quite reduced 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.600
 we are facing the part 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.850
 the most important part now begins to 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.960
 add one thing that really is the most 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.880
 relevant are the strengths of each 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.430
 runner for what they have prepared 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.460
 for three months during to be in 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.250
 this week the leaders of your team to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.549
 not 100% but not having lost 80% 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.549
 of your ability 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.620
 this year the focus has been more on the 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.510
 organizer in doing double sessions of 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.600
 hard covers 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.460
 that do not exceed the altitude or 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.990
 altimetry that took shape the year 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.300
 past they go through much more land 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.150
 bearable but this week it was obvious 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.180
 a lot more than the cumulative level that is 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.070
 as we call us 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.380
 I believe that a key day starts with the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.000
 day 17 the top and 7 where is the top and 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.520
 although I have already uploaded the truth is 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.230
 that there is a lot of climbing here that I do not know 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.960
 but the top was already one of those 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.570
 they really put it like last year 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.920
 like the top coppi 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.350
 is 20 km from the arrival of the day and the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.850
 day 17 so there you are going to go 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.850
 defining how the general 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.100
 and then the next day comes on the 18th 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.410
 again the sprint to the ball is like this 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.150
 that helps them rest for 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.340
 recover for the last two days of 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.890
 really strenuous and hard mountain 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.360
 Obviously uploading andean that has more 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.090
 or less from the accumulated level I think 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.160
 that 900 meters a little less would go up 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.320
 four or five or six times like that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.850
 at least to concretize the 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.530
 four times more to specify a 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.720
 unevenness of those who will accumulate these 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.190
 two days in a row of stage and the other 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.540
 they rise important that is usually the tonic 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.910
 also that the last week of the turn 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.420
 it usually rains 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.520
 last year the truth is that they were but 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.190
 past breathtaking water steps i 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.060
 I remember at a stage of 240 kilometers 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.710
 facing the top of the turn remember 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.680
 Anton told me that I was looking and I 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.420
 says this inhuman and it has already been this 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.220
 last effort and spend less until the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.180
 which to the car caravan for 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.440
 to rest a moment because the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.000
 true that the climatic conditions 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.800
 they can also be adverse because 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.780
 when it's cold there it's cold then 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.320
 even if it's even a month ago it stopped 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.490
 May is complicated and usually makes 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.230
 colder because the north italy 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.940
 it truly closes good to Milan 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.610
 who are the organizers always 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.590
 Milanese protagÃ³nicos shooting and there is another 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.030
 interesting thing that that ends 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.710
 it has always been very smart has 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.570
 Italy ending in the rubber 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.280
 because football championship ends this 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.200
 week and that week is free in the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.000
 television broadcast is protagonist in 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.300
 italy too and the fans the typhois 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.100
 like that that passion that vibrates that they have 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.480
 Italians with cycling especially 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.220
 in this last week in the north of 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.670
 italy this sector that has a lot 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.709
 many cyclists and protagonists 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.520
 squad agonists that are from that 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.800
 sector the truth is that cycling in 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.370
 milan the last day about everything is lived 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.360
 but they are are 20 are 30 kilometers away 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.680
 time trial are really in one there 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.870
 people who already finished their turn the day 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.640
 previous or two days ago I think that 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.459
 really those who are going to dispute this 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.049
 stage only the specialists that you lope 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.900
 and two or three days before the turn 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.400
 climbing pine nuts and taking the grupeta the 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.410
 last comment the sprint's is 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.880
 trying to figure out the time for 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.940
 spend as little as possible and dispute is 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.620
 this stage the duomo the duomo of a sea 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.510
 of people I think to say people have 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.380
 seen images of last year of the year 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.810
 previous 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.840
 the duo mode is dressed in pink like that 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.370
 better is really pink and everyone who 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.380
 it becomes a turn around the dome of 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.060
 arriving from the time trial and good 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.900
 they are saying your name is going up a 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.270
 podium and firing t 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.570
 then the people already the tifosi of a 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.970
 madness will not let you out not an autograph 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.470
 they really adore you and thank you 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.509
 that he has been in his land enjoying 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.860
 of his civics and I find that the book 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.190
 ends in one of the races as 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.470
 they should finish many other 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.440
 well we are closing then this 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.720
