 Together we start the tour and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:54.809
 When asked what does wing mean 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:57.449
 flat mood of love or one 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.360
 financial situation is relaxing 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.830

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.430

 share the audience because it's a lot to us 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.640
 The joy made them happy 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.950
 people seem to be 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.430

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.320
 to the concert as the people with 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.030
 to get wet eyes and we the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.160

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.869
 Thank you for your return home

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.429
 close 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.950
 this quality these musical sounds 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.319
 full of energy that we both discovered 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.470
 have done so very much 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.569
 as with other for example to the 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.850
 preparation and heart I noticed 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.950
 yourself must be in this joy and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.799
 to heart his otherwise it is not 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.990
 authentic and chemist and i have 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.170
 a lot of processes if you keep going 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.630
 in these innovations have come and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.180
 then things have come that were so 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.610
 I have never experienced it before 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.560
 such as one day was in the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.980
 through and then comes these melodies 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.010
 his 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.900
 what is my god thinking what is that and am 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.800
 quickly added to the study 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.360
 Everything was still done after I have a lot 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.019
 sent as an e-mail 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.000
 a short time later I caught that and was 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.280
 so much that I believe - and one 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.260
 hour came the tears and 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.430
 Herbert the most beautiful thing I find 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.890
 have each heard and the most beautiful for 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.489
 Of course I'm horny played it is 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.000
 so beautiful there is no violinist 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.760
 Of course, the games can be improvised 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.530
 wonderful haydn and mozart tours like 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.799
 sees also perfectly can the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.620
 wonderful orchestra vienna but she can 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.340
 that is the emergency stop it 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.379
 sensational and developed 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.629
 thus avoid commission make a 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.730
 she sounded alone in agreement with the 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.550
 nature and these are beautiful things 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.950
 they too, I have to say 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:19.720
 you are really wonderful from the sky 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.879
 or heard and heard 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.069
 discovered that we both are a big one 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:29.200
 Love for the ideas stood 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.290
 It was first a name complaining about it 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.530
 that as an input for me and my mine 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.650
 desire and my idea was the duck 's 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.760
 four elements to bring along with 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.680
 music with improvisation and what 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.220
 particularly close to my heart is also 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.860
 rather go to games or 1 heart 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:57.879
 to take to 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:04:02.260
 what if they are the daily ones today 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:05.290
 decision to go in joy love 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.670
 actually wake up after waking up 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.549
 make aware that this is about today 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.989
 through the day 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.419
 there is so much fear i have too 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.820
 said in my teacher you or friend 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.799
 These two templates were and must 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.840
 We learn nothing and their religions 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.160
 and gave it to my well-being too 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.320
 experienced but it goes the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.860
 decision which of the energy or for 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.210
 when it's scary or 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.370
 church window love this high is the 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.760
 joy this childlike soul the 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.690
 Armor remains the offense is 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.190
 probably lose and I became 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.530
 rated that it is not so good 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.780
 and for us this decision is in 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.330
 the frequencies and in concerts want 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.650
 we do it with the people because of this 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.410
 create transformation 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.690
 the decision at least concerns that 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:01.340
 you can decide he can understand 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.980
 what is the audience allowed on yours? 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.380
 look forward to concerts 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.940
 We will all be happy because we 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.270
 Try his different and different ones 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.370
 people can tell me that singing 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:19.760
 sacred local of the antique used to be there 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:23.480
 much to surprise 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.840
 we will be beautiful and we will be with you 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:31.190
 already share a country to dance yes 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.950
 cool between latin and pop stuff 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:39.440
 and a lot of meditative music too 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:41.120
 For example, if you produce that is that 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.860
 is a country originate 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.800
 relaxation we can together 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.950
 we will experience something together and 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.650
 must remind one more of us remember who 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.540

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.639
 are in this invitation to the joy and 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.880
 to be common that it all 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.289
 we probably forgot 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.400
 can thank the fight 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:11.300
