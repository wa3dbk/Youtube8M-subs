00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.459
 what is it made of 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.530
 Now in the Austrian Alps doomsday 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.070
 Moscow Metro departs 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.170
 rest for a few hours 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.310
 street fish in muddy, he as always hopes 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.759
 catch a big baby and 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.509
 traveling lightly anticipating 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:23.480
 how to come back 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.480
 with a substantial catch for dinner 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.369
 all his equipment consists of bishkek 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.460
 small bag and quite convenient 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.000
 operative knife 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.430
 but it's not just some old legs 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.080
 probably the most popular knife 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.080
 swiss army knife 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.960
 in this little dodgy 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.590
 The tool has all sorts of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.590
 priborchiki that will be required so that 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.749
 during the travelling 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.709
 not to mention some that him 

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:53.370
 will not need 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.879
 posting all these skillful stuff 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.710
 such a compact design 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.399
 made a swiss army knife 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.770
 design classics 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.770
 nothing is done 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.630
 Switzerland 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.510
 it is famous for its beautiful mountains 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.290
 Byrd Cheese Bills 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.290
 and a cuckoo clock 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.340
 but in towns and bang 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.539
 there is own reason for glory so 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.359
 how are the companies located here 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.390
 and Victoria Knox 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.979
 the company began to produce on 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.840
 resident of swiss army thousand 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.100
 eight hundred and ninety first year 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.530
 more than a hundred years have passed and now in this factory 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.510
 make 28 thousand of such knives every day 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.740
 saying about 90 thousand other knives 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.290
 and tools 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.299
 urs weiss 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.049
 engaged in marketing these 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.580
 famous products 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.800
 all sport is the first model if she 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.440
 patented june twelve 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.850
 thousand 800 90 the seventh year with her 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.550
 look at l knife until today 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.330
 avenues of stars changed and very 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.170
 little play such a smaller bet size a little 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.760
 others refuse but it is more or less 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 but also the school that stand back 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.009
 Now there are models with a lot 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.349
 tools up to forty one pieces 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.069
 including screwdriver scissors and it seems 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.879
 turn off 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.879
 other models even have a memory card 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.790
 so do you practice 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.719
 Do you go fishing in 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.799
 scout trip or do not 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.680
 long flight into space is quite 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.739
 it is possible that some kind of useful to you 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.739
 of these tools 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.599
 only problem for workers 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.980
 factory quiz societies 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.019
 it will make these things pretty 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.709
 quickly 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.079
 it all starts on Monday morning from 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.079
 delivery steel for a week 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:48.980
 leads her in huge rolls 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.299
 weight per ton 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.459
 they are ready for processing isstra 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.040
 mentally accounts yorg haider proceeds to 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.040
 making 100 thousand on live blades 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.839
 I worked in the company for 10 years 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.539
 I like it 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.359
 I made millions of tools 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.359
 I don't know exactly how much 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.249
 about two hundred and fifty different 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.169
 devices including the main 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:19.839
 blades stamp 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:22.729
 on each machine hourly do about 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.579
 twenty thousand items 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.980
 exerting pressure 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.739
 160 tons 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.139
 to society ward form history 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.139
 new rolls 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.719
 but after stamping remain serrated 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.719
 on the edges of the blades 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.869
 it is reasonable to assume that they are simply polished 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.949
 but in fact they use unusual ones 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.799
 adaptations so-called 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.299
 drum grinding 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.549
 centrifuge 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.569
 in third place with bears 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.319
 drawn by a multitude of tyrannical pebbles and 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.299
 thanks to the energetic shake-up perched on 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.299
 metal is gradually removed 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.259
 then a movable magnetic envelope 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.709
 polished parts move easily 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.709
 from the tank 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.569
 but now I only know 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.799
 economy to cut something 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.199
 besides warm oil so they are like 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.020
 recruits of swiss armenia 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.400
 need some hardening 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.880
 heat treatment is performed 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.880
 called quenching 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.860
 two thousand years now 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.860
 passes the baptism of fire in the furnace 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.400
 it's skillful balanced 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.000
 process 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.060
 the stronger the steel becomes 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.340
 more fragile it is made therefore it is necessary 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.290
 heat it infused 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.460
 temperature to make perfect or 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.469
 track 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.889
 then you need to feel the blade for 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.510
 strictly defined thickness 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.810
 otherwise the knife will be ready 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.810
 open or close 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.070
 on this and slow moving carousel 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.110
 they are pumped out exactly to thickness two and three 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.409
 tenths of a millimeter 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.679
 now it is very important to make a believer 

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:15.770
 edge 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.080
 unfortunately it seems that this is part 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.990
 the process is still carefully 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.990
 guarded firm 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.909
 I can not tell you 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.669
 perhaps this is one of our secrets 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.409
 but everyone knows that we do it well 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.529
 because in the end 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.529
 they are really sharp 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.729
 two o'clock blade from stamped 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.680
 yorgom morning sharpened and end up 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.680
 python pepper picker 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.069
 singer need to cleverly collect 64 different 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.379
 components including various blades 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.309
 tools and numerous 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.900
 washer 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.289
 and pins 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.740
 and of course everything must be done exactly 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.740
 order 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.099
 in order to properly assemble on 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:09.990
 Well m 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.759
 need attention 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.759
 and patience 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.310
 but singer 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.750
 skillfully completes the assembly of a new knife 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.159
 every two minutes 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.159
 and this only comes with experience 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.549
 now there are only final details 

00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:30.560
 including 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.919
 characteristic red code card with emblem 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.270
 swiss armenia 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.889
 and on future chips 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.889
 and extremely important body cleanings 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.089
 and last but not least the stage 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:45.509
 each knife is cleaned and manually checked 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:48.219
 before you pull off the plum even 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:49.629
 meticulous serviceman 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:52.960
 swiss armenia 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.419
 or of course hoping for a trick 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:56.389
 fisherman 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:57.819
 four hundred kilometers from here 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:06:59.689
 young thomas gets the opportunity 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:02.189
 at 5 use a knife when 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:05.599
 pulls out a hook 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.659
 with this knife he needs 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:09.869
 do something else 

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:12.369
 that he loves even more than fishing
