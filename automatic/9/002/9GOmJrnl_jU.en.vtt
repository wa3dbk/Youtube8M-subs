00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
hammer it to half the thickness so you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.510 
hammer it to half the thickness so you
can<00:01:25.770> see<00:01:26.750> three<00:01:27.750> mil<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.440> this<00:01:28.620> should<00:01:28.830> be<00:01:28.980> one

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
can see three mil so this should be one

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.390 
can see three mil so this should be one
and<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.760> half<00:01:29.940> mil<00:01:30.300> hi
