00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.290
 is it not surprising that the most 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.550
 powerful man in the world becomes 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:22.300
 the subject of discussion we are residents of this 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.119
 the planets were looking for a savior we are talking about 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.910
 form of life with existence itself which 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.670
 defies our feeling 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.070
 superiority in the universe 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.420
 humanity has a sad experience 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.200
 obedience to people with tremendous power 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.660
 corrupts 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.850
 absolute power corrupts absolutely 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.360

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.719
 correctly we know the land does not crawl out 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.940
 hell and they come down from heaven world 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.410
 so carried away by the fact that he can that 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.410
 nobody asked what he should 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:07.970
 year how everything happens fever 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:10.479
 anger is a feeling of helplessness which 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.479
 makes good people 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.479
 cruel 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.140
 what do you flow ? 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.909
 she will spill
