the breaking of the Trenton gharana this
is<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:18.900> only<00:00:19.260> way<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.740> cut<00:00:20.310> such<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> genius<00:00:21.590> if

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
is the only way to cut such a genius if

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.769 
is the only way to cut such a genius if
I<00:00:23.039> will<00:00:23.580> cut<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:25.519> don't<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:27.060> understand

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
I will cut so you don't can understand

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.139 
I will cut so you don't can understand
how<00:00:28.230> he<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:29.420> produced<00:00:30.560> which<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.149> texture

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
how he is produced which is the texture

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.840 
how he is produced which is the texture
of<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.480> cheese<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.020> now<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:35.070> will<00:00:35.219> cut<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
of the cheese and now we will cut a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.540 
of the cheese and now we will cut a
typical<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.690> more<00:00:36.960> small<00:00:37.500> small<00:00:37.950> small<00:00:40.550> the

typical of more small small small the
way<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.090> always<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.780> same<00:00:43.640> always<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.940> this

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
way is always the same always in this

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.369 
way is always the same always in this
point<00:00:49.219> do<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.820> understand<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
point do you do you understand here is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.689 
point do you do you understand here is
the<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.699> place<00:00:54.030> where<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.170> wheel<00:00:55.699> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the the place where in the wheel the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
the the place where in the wheel the
cheese<00:00:57.000> makes<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.989> higher<00:00:59.510> resistance<00:01:00.510> now

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
cheese makes is higher resistance now

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.969 
cheese makes is higher resistance now
you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:02.100> help<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.940> cheese<00:01:03.210> why<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.559> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
you can help the cheese why here is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.190 
you can help the cheese why here is
fragile<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.330> milk<00:01:07.340> 80%<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.880> water<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:10.320> 20%<00:01:11.220> fat

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
fragile in milk 80% is water the 20% fat

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.600 
fragile in milk 80% is water the 20% fat
protein<00:01:13.549> sugar<00:01:15.439> this<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.920> reason<00:01:17.340> why<00:01:17.549> you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
protein sugar this is the reason why you

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.410 
protein sugar this is the reason why you
need<00:01:18.150> some<00:01:18.810> salt<00:01:21.259> working<00:01:23.060> producing<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
need some salt working producing the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.140 
need some salt working producing the
cheese<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.140> made<00:01:25.920> an<00:01:26.070> example<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.759> when

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
cheese I made an example is like when

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.080 
cheese I made an example is like when
it's<00:01:27.689> very<00:01:27.990> windy<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.369> problems<00:01:29.909> or

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it's very windy and you have problems or

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.319 
it's very windy and you have problems or
your<00:01:30.329> hands<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.439> oil<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.579> cream<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
your hands the oil is the cream that you

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.819 
your hands the oil is the cream that you
put<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:33.869> hands<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.380> oil<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
put on your hands the oil of the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.210 
put on your hands the oil of the
function<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.820> keep<00:01:36.689> elasticity<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.100> skin

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
function to keep elasticity to the skin

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.910 
function to keep elasticity to the skin
of<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.970> cheese<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.780> why<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.290> use<00:01:40.320> water

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
of this cheese this is why we use water

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520 
of this cheese this is why we use water
oil<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.610> salt<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.119> manage<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:43.020> these

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
oil and salt for manage all these

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.219 
oil and salt for manage all these
cheese's<00:01:44.130> obviously<00:01:45.060> ditches<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.869> are

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
cheese's obviously ditches that are

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.270 
cheese's obviously ditches that are
younger<00:01:46.979> needs<00:01:47.759> more<00:01:48.570> time<00:01:49.100> dedicated<00:01:50.100> on

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
younger needs more time dedicated on

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.450 
younger needs more time dedicated on
this<00:01:50.549> way<00:01:50.759> cheese<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.659> are<00:01:51.869> more<00:01:52.259> aged<00:01:52.530> needs

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this way cheese that are more aged needs

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.719 
this way cheese that are more aged needs
less<00:01:53.970> time<00:01:54.329> dedicated<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.649> way<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
less time dedicated on this way but this

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.620 
less time dedicated on this way but this
is<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.810> need<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.520> this<00:02:00.180> is

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
is what you need to do and this is

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.410 
is what you need to do and this is
the<00:02:00.689> place<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.409> need<00:02:01.619> for<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:03.060> age

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the place that you need for really age

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
the place that you need for really age
and<00:02:03.930> make<00:02:04.229> Latinas<00:02:05.149> for<00:02:06.149> each<00:02:06.479> single<00:02:07.289> cheese

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
and make Latinas for each single cheese

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.900 
and make Latinas for each single cheese
and<00:02:08.220> now<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:09.420> catch<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> typical

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
and now we catch so this is the typical

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.410 
and now we catch so this is the typical
earth<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:13.200> cut<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.250> cheese<00:02:14.550> there<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.180> no

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
earth to cut the cheese there is no

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
earth to cut the cheese there is no
another<00:02:15.900> way<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:18.260> classic<00:02:19.260> way<00:02:21.950> making

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
another way this is a classic way making

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.479 
another way this is a classic way making
so<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.670> cheese<00:02:23.940> understand<00:02:24.599> alone<00:02:25.040> where<00:02:26.040> he

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
so the cheese understand alone where he

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.680 
so the cheese understand alone where he
must<00:02:27.500> broken<00:02:28.500> do<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.010> see<00:02:31.519> do<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.580> see<00:02:32.670> if<00:02:33.390> I

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
must broken do you see do you see if I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.650 
must broken do you see do you see if I
let<00:02:34.019> go<00:02:34.260> alone<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.220> cheese<00:02:35.489> he<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.180> cut<00:02:36.540> I

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
let go alone the cheese he will cut I

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:50.509 
let go alone the cheese he will cut I
will<00:02:48.140> another<00:02:49.140> thing<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:49.799> would<00:02:50.340> like<00:02:50.489> to

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
will another thing that I would like to

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.150 
will another thing that I would like to
underline<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.560> we<00:02:52.560> follow<00:02:52.860> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
underline is that we follow the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.850 
underline is that we follow the
seasonality<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.090> cheese's<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.230> when<00:02:55.829> I

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
seasonality of the cheese's so when I

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.960 
seasonality of the cheese's so when I
say<00:02:56.130> 250<00:02:57.140> 250<00:02:58.140> different<00:02:58.530> Italian<00:02:59.280> cheeses<00:02:59.730> in

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
say 250 250 different Italian cheeses in

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.250 
say 250 250 different Italian cheeses in
this<00:03:00.180> case<00:03:00.450> in<00:03:01.079> this<00:03:01.290> cave<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:02.190> means<00:03:02.640> that

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
this case in this cave it means that

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.039 
this case in this cave it means that
there's<00:03:04.260> no<00:03:04.500> one<00:03:05.069> day<00:03:05.370> when<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.510> year<00:03:06.750> when

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
there's no one day when in the year when

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.229 
there's no one day when in the year when
you<00:03:07.260> can<00:03:07.470> see<00:03:07.650> all<00:03:07.890> these<00:03:08.430> cheese's<00:03:09.030> all
