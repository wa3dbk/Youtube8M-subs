00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.269 
for recording a time-lapse here's an
example<00:00:19.579> I<00:00:19.880> set<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.869> camera<00:00:21.079> to<00:00:21.439> record<00:00:21.740> one

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
example I set the camera to record one

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.359 
example I set the camera to record one
photo<00:00:22.640> every<00:00:22.880> 5<00:00:23.509> seconds<00:00:24.020> for<00:00:24.380> 15<00:00:24.800> minutes<00:00:25.189> and

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
photo every 5 seconds for 15 minutes and

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.570 
photo every 5 seconds for 15 minutes and
then<00:00:26.240> I<00:00:26.509> use<00:00:26.810> my<00:00:27.019> computer<00:00:27.470> to<00:00:27.769> put<00:00:28.189> them<00:00:28.400> all

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
then I use my computer to put them all

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.870 
then I use my computer to put them all
together<00:00:28.759> as<00:00:29.210> a<00:00:29.269> time-lapse<00:00:30.170> movie<00:00:30.880> shooting

on a nice sturdy tripod that won't move
now<00:00:48.530> I<00:00:48.589> always<00:00:49.010> shoot<00:00:49.369> a<00:00:49.519> test<00:00:49.850> shot<00:00:50.059> to<00:00:50.299> make

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
now I always shoot a test shot to make

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.149 
now I always shoot a test shot to make
sure<00:00:50.510> everything<00:00:51.110> looks<00:00:51.260> good<00:00:51.409> and<00:00:54.010> if<00:00:55.010> it

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
sure everything looks good and if it

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.399 
sure everything looks good and if it
does<00:00:55.400> then<00:00:55.970> I<00:00:56.030> take<00:00:56.479> note<00:00:56.780> of<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:57.140> shutter

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
does then I take note of the shutter

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.799 
does then I take note of the shutter
speed<00:00:57.619> and<00:00:57.830> aperture<00:00:58.610> that<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.119> camera<00:00:59.540> used

speed and aperture that the camera used

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.350 
speed and aperture that the camera used
and<00:01:00.049> then<00:01:00.470> switch<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.280> manual<00:01:01.850> exposure

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
and then switch to the manual exposure

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.320 
and then switch to the manual exposure
mode<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:03.019> dial<00:01:03.710> in<00:01:03.979> those<00:01:04.220> exact<00:01:04.820> settings

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
mode and dial in those exact settings

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.620 
mode and dial in those exact settings
manually<00:01:05.840> why<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:07.729> camera<00:01:08.210> doesn't

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
manually why so the camera doesn't

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.109 
manually why so the camera doesn't
change<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.170> exposure<00:01:09.680> settings<00:01:10.310> during<00:01:10.820> the

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
change the exposure settings during the

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:11.859 
change the exposure settings during the
time<00:01:11.390> lapse

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
time lapse

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.830

even<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.770> slight<00:01:13.010> shutter<00:01:13.550> speed<00:01:13.970> change<00:01:14.360> or<00:01:14.570> an

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
even a slight shutter speed change or an

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.750 
even a slight shutter speed change or an

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.360 
aperture change in the middle of the
time-lapse<00:01:17.270> will<00:01:17.810> ruin<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.380> effect<00:01:18.500> so

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
time-lapse will ruin the effect so

second<00:01:58.880> for<00:01:59.000> this<00:01:59.180> example<00:02:00.190> now<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.250> have<00:02:01.610> to

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
second for this example now you have to

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.149 
second for this example now you have to
decide<00:02:01.940> how<00:02:02.720> many<00:02:02.780> photos<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.770> want<00:02:03.950> the

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
decide how many photos you want the

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.469 
decide how many photos you want the

camera to take during the time-lapse 999

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.080 
camera to take during the time-lapse 999
is<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.899> maximum<00:02:09.549> some<00:02:10.549> things<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.940> consider

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
is the maximum some things to consider

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.899 
is the maximum some things to consider
when<00:02:11.720> setting<00:02:11.959> up<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.349> time-lapse<00:02:12.680> are<00:02:13.280> how

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
when setting up a time-lapse are how

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.910 
when setting up a time-lapse are how
much<00:02:14.180> time<00:02:14.540> do<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.840> want<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.170> wait<00:02:15.379> around<00:02:15.530> for

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
much time do you want to wait around for

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.489 
much time do you want to wait around for
the<00:02:16.159> time-lapse<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.879> finish<00:02:17.239> how<00:02:18.079> long<00:02:18.319> will

the time-lapse to finish how long will
your<00:02:18.590> battery<00:02:18.980> last<00:02:19.269> you<00:02:20.269> don't<00:02:20.420> want<00:02:20.659> it<00:02:20.749> to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
your battery last you don't want it to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.750 
your battery last you don't want it to
die<00:02:21.079> in<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.439> middle<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.769> your<00:02:21.859> time-lapse

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
die in the middle of your time-lapse

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.479 
die in the middle of your time-lapse
and<00:02:22.849> is<00:02:23.569> your<00:02:23.780> memory<00:02:24.260> card<00:02:24.620> going<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.980> fill<00:02:25.310> up

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
and is your memory card going to fill up

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.009 
and is your memory card going to fill up
before<00:02:25.849> all<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.420> pictures<00:02:26.810> have<00:02:26.840> been

before all the pictures have been

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.699 
before all the pictures have been
recorded<00:02:28.030> I'm<00:02:29.030> going<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.569> choose<00:02:29.810> 10<00:02:30.260> frames

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
recorded I'm going to choose 10 frames

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.100 
recorded I'm going to choose 10 frames
for<00:02:31.040> this<00:02:31.190> example<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.239> finishes<00:02:32.420> quickly

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
for this example so it finishes quickly

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.009 
for this example so it finishes quickly
but<00:02:33.769> in<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.980> real<00:02:34.220> situation<00:02:34.629> 10<00:02:35.629> frames

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.199 
but in a real situation 10 frames
probably<00:02:36.769> wouldn't<00:02:37.069> be<00:02:37.159> enough<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.819> create<00:02:38.060> a

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
probably wouldn't be enough to create a

probably wouldn't be enough to create a
very<00:02:38.480> interesting<00:02:38.750> time-lapse<00:02:40.120> now<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.150> select

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
very interesting time-lapse now I select

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.759 
very interesting time-lapse now I select
on<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:43.690> step<00:02:44.690> away<00:02:44.870> from<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.290> camera

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
on and step away from the camera

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.460 
on and step away from the camera

and let it do its thing now for any
reason<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.099> want<00:02:49.129> to<00:02:49.400> cancel<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.910> time-lapse

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540

in<00:02:50.870> midstream<00:02:51.349> you'll<00:02:52.069> have<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.579> turn<00:02:52.819> the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
in midstream you'll have to turn the

in midstream you'll have to turn the
camera<00:02:53.420> off<00:02:53.890> when<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.010> camera<00:02:55.340> is<00:02:55.370> finished

taking<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.450> time-lapse<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.410> will<00:02:57.620> revert

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
taking the time-lapse it will revert

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.460
