that pot of water I'll set it on top of
there<00:01:26.240> let's<00:01:26.720> see<00:01:26.899> how<00:01:27.020> long<00:01:27.050> it<00:01:27.259> takes<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:27.590> to

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
there let's see how long it takes it to

bowl anybody that is ever used an
alcohol<00:01:30.649> stove<00:01:30.950> out<00:01:31.610> enough<00:01:32.000> I<00:01:32.179> don't<00:01:32.390> know

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
alcohol stove out enough I don't know

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.790 
alcohol stove out enough I don't know
how<00:01:32.599> can<00:01:32.840> our<00:01:32.929> camping<00:01:33.289> trip<00:01:33.410> knows<00:01:33.619> two

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
how can our camping trip knows two

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.699 
how can our camping trip knows two
things<00:01:34.209> one<00:01:35.209> is<00:01:35.479> that<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.080> wind<00:01:36.289> will<00:01:36.590> blow

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
things one is that the wind will blow

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.040 
things one is that the wind will blow
the<00:01:36.979> flame<00:01:37.220> out<00:01:37.459> that's<00:01:37.819> just<00:01:38.179> it<00:01:38.509> just

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
the flame out that's just it just

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.070 
the flame out that's just it just
happens<00:01:39.500> good<00:01:39.890> wind<00:01:40.099> comes<00:01:40.369> along<00:01:40.959> flame<00:01:41.959> is

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
happens good wind comes along flame is

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.469 
happens good wind comes along flame is
blown<00:01:42.289> out<00:01:42.500> so<00:01:43.459> this<00:01:43.700> also<00:01:43.910> acts<00:01:44.300> as<00:01:44.420> a

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
blown out so this also acts as a

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.930 
blown out so this also acts as a
windshield<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.619> second<00:01:46.160> problem<00:01:46.340> being<00:01:46.670> is

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
windshield the second problem being is

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.120 
windshield the second problem being is
at<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.420> top<00:01:47.599> of<00:01:47.660> this<00:01:47.869> is<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:48.289> narrow<00:01:48.679> that

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
at the top of this is so narrow that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.729 
at the top of this is so narrow that
pots<00:01:49.970> if<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.390> bump<00:01:50.690> them<00:01:50.899> or<00:01:51.080> if<00:01:51.590> they're

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:51.739 
pots if you bump them or if they're

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.410 
pots if you bump them or if they're
sitting<00:01:51.979> a<00:01:52.009> little<00:01:52.069> bit<00:01:52.280> off<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:53.090> they<00:01:53.270> could

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
sitting a little bit off that they could

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.940 
sitting a little bit off that they could
fall<00:01:53.630> off<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.140> spill<00:01:54.500> your<00:01:54.619> food<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:56.090> having<00:01:56.360> a

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
fall off and spill your food so having a

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.080 
fall off and spill your food so having a
something<00:01:57.950> like<00:01:58.069> this<00:01:58.220> hexagon<00:01:58.700> wood<00:01:58.880> stove

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
something like this hexagon wood stove

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.600 
something like this hexagon wood stove
solves<00:01:59.450> two<00:01:59.479> problems<00:01:59.599> one<00:02:00.289> it<00:02:01.130> provides<00:02:01.489> a

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
solves two problems one it provides a

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.510 
solves two problems one it provides a
windshield<00:02:01.910> for<00:02:02.239> your<00:02:02.300> flame<00:02:02.739> to<00:02:03.739> it<00:02:04.009> provides

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
windshield for your flame to it provides

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
top of so while we're going to is we're

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.990 
top of so while we're going to is we're
on<00:02:09.289> test<00:02:09.500> set<00:02:09.679> out<00:02:09.860> right<00:02:10.069> now<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.640> see<00:02:10.940> how

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
on test set out right now and see how

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.350 
on test set out right now and see how
things<00:02:11.180> how<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.900> works<00:02:12.110> out<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:13.640> have<00:02:13.849> this

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
things how this works out we have this

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.980 
things how this works out we have this
is<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.920> heat<00:02:16.220> gasoline<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.210> freezers<00:02:17.690> four

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
is that heat gasoline and freezers four

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.700 
is that heat gasoline and freezers four
ounces<00:02:18.290> inside<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.830> bottle<00:02:18.980> right<00:02:19.280> now

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
ounces inside of the bottle right now

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:28.860 
ounces inside of the bottle right now
I<00:02:25.650> want<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.710> put<00:02:26.830> one<00:02:27.210> liquid<00:02:28.210> ounce<00:02:28.360> inside<00:02:28.750> of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
I want to put one liquid ounce inside of

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:41.270 
I want to put one liquid ounce inside of
there

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:50.370 

okay<00:02:42.280> we're<00:02:42.520> down<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.760> three<00:02:42.790> ounces<00:02:43.270> now

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.230 

it's<00:02:50.950> lit<00:02:51.420> now<00:02:52.420> we're<00:02:52.570> going<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.720> give<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:52.930> up

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
it's lit now we're going to give it up

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.390 
it's lit now we're going to give it up
and<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:55.360> time<00:02:55.570> we<00:02:55.750> let<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:57.540> close<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.720> door

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
and the time we let it close that door

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.750 
and the time we let it close that door
so<00:03:00.400> our<00:03:00.520> flame<00:03:00.760> doesn't<00:03:00.910> get<00:03:01.180> blown<00:03:01.330> out<00:03:02.760> now

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
so our flame doesn't get blown out now

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.620 
so our flame doesn't get blown out now
we've<00:03:04.060> started<00:03:04.330> our<00:03:05.940> methanol<00:03:06.940> gel<00:03:07.270> test

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
we've started our methanol gel test

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.690 
we've started our methanol gel test
right<00:03:08.470> when<00:03:08.620> we<00:03:08.710> lit<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:08.950> so<00:03:09.370> we're<00:03:09.520> going<00:03:09.580> to

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
right when we lit it so we're going to

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.210 
right when we lit it so we're going to
the<00:03:09.790> same<00:03:09.970> thing<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:11.500> about<00:03:11.620> two<00:03:12.010> minutes

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
the same thing it's about two minutes

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.250 
the same thing it's about two minutes
after<00:03:14.010> say<00:03:15.010> 1257<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.720> we're<00:03:16.870> going<00:03:16.960> to<00:03:17.050> go<00:03:17.080> and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
after say 1257 so we're going to go and

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.400 
after say 1257 so we're going to go and
put<00:03:17.380> our<00:03:17.470> water<00:03:17.680> on<00:03:18.450> at<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.600> same<00:03:19.840> time<00:03:20.050> just

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
put our water on at the same time just

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.570 
put our water on at the same time just
like<00:03:20.500> with<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.740> methanol<00:03:21.100> test<00:03:21.340> we're<00:03:21.490> not

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
like with the methanol test we're not

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.790 
like with the methanol test we're not
going<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.820> make<00:03:22.120> any<00:03:22.180> exceptions<00:03:22.680> for<00:03:23.680> this

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
going to make any exceptions for this

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.410 
going to make any exceptions for this
stove<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.250> prime<00:03:24.490> because<00:03:24.790> we<00:03:24.940> did<00:03:25.060> not<00:03:25.090> have

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
stove to prime because we did not have

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.710 
stove to prime because we did not have
to<00:03:25.570> list<00:03:25.720> methanol<00:03:26.170> prime<00:03:27.480> one<00:03:28.480> thing<00:03:28.630> I'm

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
to list methanol prime one thing I'm

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.150 
to list methanol prime one thing I'm
noticing<00:03:28.870> right<00:03:29.140> off<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.500> bat<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:30.040> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
noticing right off the bat is that the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.300 
noticing right off the bat is that the
alcohol<00:03:30.340> stove<00:03:30.880> is<00:03:31.030> putting<00:03:31.360> out<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> much

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
alcohol stove is putting out a much

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.640 
alcohol stove is putting out a much
larger<00:03:33.310> flame<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.120> it's<00:03:34.810> like<00:03:34.990> it's<00:03:35.230> coming

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
larger flame and it's like it's coming

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.790 
larger flame and it's like it's coming
around<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.540> notches<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:39.430> stove<00:03:40.800> get

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
around the the notches of the stove get

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.100 
around the the notches of the stove get
this<00:03:41.920> off<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.130> tripod<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:42.820> take<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:42.970> look<00:03:43.180> and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
this off the tripod and take a look and

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.280 
this off the tripod and take a look and
I<00:03:44.170> can<00:03:44.500> see<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:44.800> or<00:03:44.950> not<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.810> flame<00:03:47.170> is

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
I can see that or not the flame is

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.660 
I can see that or not the flame is
coming<00:03:47.620> through<00:03:47.710> the<00:03:47.890> notches<00:03:48.070> of<00:03:48.490> the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
coming through the notches of the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.370 
coming through the notches of the
hexagon<00:03:49.090> wood<00:03:49.420> stove<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.990> see<00:03:50.170> how<00:03:50.260> is

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
hexagon wood stove you see how is

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.290 
hexagon wood stove you see how is
starting<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.650> change<00:03:50.830> colors<00:03:53.610> so<00:03:54.610> I<00:03:54.670> suspect

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
starting to change colors so I suspect

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.180 
starting to change colors so I suspect
that<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.960> alcohol<00:03:56.110> stove<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:56.830> going<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.070> bring

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
that the alcohol stove is going to bring

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.420 
that the alcohol stove is going to bring
this<00:03:57.340> up<00:03:57.520> to<00:03:57.750> falling<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:58.840> no<00:03:59.020> time<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.530> suspect

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
this up to falling in no time I suspect

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.130 
this up to falling in no time I suspect
that<00:04:00.520> we'll<00:04:00.730> see

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.699 

we've<00:04:08.140> come<00:04:08.380> up<00:04:08.500> on<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:09.480> 5-minute<00:04:10.480> mark<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:11.230> I

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
we've come up on the 5-minute mark and I

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.750 
we've come up on the 5-minute mark and I
think<00:04:12.040> we<00:04:12.220> just<00:04:13.590> ran<00:04:14.590> out<00:04:14.709> of<00:04:14.739> water<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.310> mean

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
think we just ran out of water I mean

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.090 
think we just ran out of water I mean
ran<00:04:15.940> out<00:04:16.090> of<00:04:16.120> fuel<00:04:18.090> we've<00:04:19.090> got<00:04:19.269> a<00:04:19.299> steam<00:04:20.100> which

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
ran out of fuel we've got a steam which

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.400 
ran out of fuel we've got a steam which
is<00:04:21.280> about<00:04:21.579> like<00:04:21.880> what<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.419> sternal<00:04:22.840> was<00:04:23.050> maybe

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
is about like what the sternal was maybe

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.080 
is about like what the sternal was maybe
a<00:04:23.500> little<00:04:23.650> bit<00:04:23.830> more<00:04:23.980> maybe<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.850> little<00:04:24.940> bit

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
a little bit more maybe a little bit

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.640 
a little bit more maybe a little bit
more<00:04:25.210> well<00:04:25.360> may<00:04:25.450> have<00:04:25.600> I'd<00:04:25.780> notice<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.260> more

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
more well may have I'd notice a more

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.590 
more well may have I'd notice a more
accumulation<00:04:26.950> of<00:04:27.340> bubbles<00:04:27.730> up<00:04:28.360> on<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.660> side

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
accumulation of bubbles up on the side

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:38.670 
accumulation of bubbles up on the side
but<00:04:33.180> it's<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.300> little<00:04:34.540> bit<00:04:34.630> hot<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:37.350> had<00:04:38.350> to<00:04:38.440> go<00:04:38.560> on

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
but it's a little bit hot I had to go on

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.810 
but it's a little bit hot I had to go on
in<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.860> house<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.520> get<00:04:39.880> a<00:04:40.210> rag<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.610> yes<00:04:42.610> we

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
in the house and get a rag and yes we

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.390 
in the house and get a rag and yes we
are<00:04:42.940> out<00:04:43.150> of<00:04:43.180> fuel<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:43.750> one<00:04:44.260> ounce<00:04:44.440> of

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.060 

denatured<00:04:48.400> alcohol<00:04:48.490> or<00:04:49.270> that<00:04:49.419> heat<00:04:50.070> gasoline

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
denatured alcohol or that heat gasoline

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.190 
denatured alcohol or that heat gasoline
antifreeze<00:04:51.550> was<00:04:52.090> just<00:04:52.419> enough<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.750> bring<00:04:53.080> it

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
antifreeze was just enough to bring it

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.820 
antifreeze was just enough to bring it
up<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:54.790> a<00:04:54.820> nice<00:04:55.060> little<00:04:55.300> steam<00:04:55.780> but<00:04:56.410> not<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:56.800> a

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
up to a nice little steam but not to a

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.100 
up to a nice little steam but not to a
rolling<00:04:57.310> ball<00:04:57.660> so<00:04:58.660> we'll<00:04:58.780> let<00:04:58.900> everything

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
rolling ball so we'll let everything

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.350 
rolling ball so we'll let everything
cool<00:04:59.440> down<00:04:59.650> and<00:05:00.130> we'll<00:05:00.280> put<00:05:00.490> like<00:05:00.639> two<00:05:00.880> ounces

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
cool down and we'll put like two ounces

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.530 
cool down and we'll put like two ounces
of<00:05:01.590> heat<00:05:02.590> in<00:05:02.770> it<00:05:02.889> and<00:05:03.610> we're<00:05:04.120> going<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.270> give<00:05:04.450> it

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
of heat in it and we're going to give it

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.360 
of heat in it and we're going to give it
another<00:05:04.630> try<00:05:04.979> first<00:05:05.979> and<00:05:06.190> we'll<00:05:06.280> let

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
another try first and we'll let

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.000 
another try first and we'll let
everything<00:05:06.610> cool<00:05:06.880> down<00:05:07.030> real<00:05:07.240> nice<00:05:08.010> so

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
everything cool down real nice so

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:19.030 
everything cool down real nice so
there's<00:05:09.190> no<00:05:09.310> danger<00:05:09.520> of<00:05:09.700> flash<00:05:09.910> fire

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.910 

what<00:05:20.040> we<00:05:20.160> have<00:05:20.310> here<00:05:20.520> is<00:05:20.550> two<00:05:21.050> fluid<00:05:22.050> ounces<00:05:22.650> of

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
what we have here is two fluid ounces of

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.810 

we<00:05:35.280> did<00:05:35.430> not<00:05:35.580> allow<00:05:36.000> for<00:05:36.270> any<00:05:36.710> prime<00:05:37.710> time<00:05:38.040> with

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:29.380 
we've got I don't know how many minutes

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.080 
we've got I don't know how many minutes
of<00:07:29.590> all<00:07:29.770> time<00:07:30.540> probably<00:07:31.540> three<00:07:31.750> minutes<00:07:32.020> or<00:07:32.140> so

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.090 
of all time probably three minutes or so

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.210 
of all time probably three minutes or so
so<00:07:34.090> I<00:07:34.450> would<00:07:35.140> probably<00:07:35.290> have<00:07:35.590> to<00:07:35.710> use<00:07:35.890> two<00:07:36.100> and

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:36.220 
so I would probably have to use two and

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.990 
so I would probably have to use two and
a<00:07:36.280> half<00:07:36.490> ounces<00:07:36.640> of<00:07:37.090> alcohol<00:07:37.180> in<00:07:37.540> my<00:07:37.720> stove<00:07:39.000> to

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 
a half ounces of alcohol in my stove to

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.520 
a half ounces of alcohol in my stove to
get<00:07:40.120> it<00:07:40.240> to<00:07:40.330> cook<00:07:40.480> all<00:07:40.660> the<00:07:40.750> way<00:07:40.780> but<00:07:41.230> anyway

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.530 
get it to cook all the way but anyway

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:53.750 
get it to cook all the way but anyway
that<00:07:41.830> should<00:07:42.010> give<00:07:42.130> you<00:07:42.250> an<00:07:42.340> idea

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:53.760 

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.820
