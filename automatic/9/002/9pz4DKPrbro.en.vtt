you and you take a strip and make it as
long<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.649> need<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.360> put<00:00:36.360> my<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.940> strip<00:00:38.940> over

long as you need I put my the strip over

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.160 
long as you need I put my the strip over
the<00:00:39.989> bottom<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.780> under<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> bottom<00:00:42.989> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the bottom of the under the bottom of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.410 
the bottom of the under the bottom of
the<00:00:43.230> blade<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.760> think<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> gives<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.270> little

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the blade I think it gives it a little

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.319 
the blade I think it gives it a little
bit<00:00:45.629> more<00:00:45.840> protection<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.469> guess<00:00:47.329> protecting

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
bit more protection I guess protecting

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.959 
bit more protection I guess protecting
the<00:00:48.450> blade<00:00:48.890> from<00:00:49.890> getting<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:50.460> messed<00:00:50.760> up

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the blade from getting really messed up

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.160 
the blade from getting really messed up
like<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.510> right<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.870> then<00:00:54.870> when<00:00:55.079> you

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
like it is right now so then when you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.619 
like it is right now so then when you
get<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.010> put<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> little<00:00:56.760> grip<00:00:57.449> so

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
get like that you put a little grip so

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.639 
get like that you put a little grip so
it'll<00:00:57.809> hold<00:00:57.960> itself<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> blade<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.969> then

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
it'll hold itself to the blade and then

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.700 
it'll hold itself to the blade and then
you<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.890> pull<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.840> you<00:01:03.840> make<00:01:04.140> sure<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
you just pull and you make sure that it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.270 
you just pull and you make sure that it
goes<00:01:05.479> all<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> way<00:01:07.080> around<00:01:07.200> all<00:01:07.619> over<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.040> toe

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
goes all the way around all over the toe

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.270 
goes all the way around all over the toe
and<00:01:09.380> then<00:01:10.380> after<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:12.799> get<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> little<00:01:14.130> bit

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
and then after that get a little bit

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
and then after that get a little bit
farther<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:16.200> tear<00:01:17.270> let's<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.720> get

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
farther and tear let's see if we can get

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.750 
farther and tear let's see if we can get
that<00:01:18.930> too

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
anyway so i'll just tape it oh my so

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.460 
anyway so i'll just tape it oh my so
when<00:02:35.890> i<00:02:35.920> first<00:02:36.220> did<00:02:36.459> this<00:02:36.670> i<00:02:36.970> found<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.170> at

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
when i first did this i found that at

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.259 
when i first did this i found that at
the<00:02:39.010> very<00:02:39.040> end<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:40.780> have<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.850> it's<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:43.000> little

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
the very end you have to it's a little

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.170 
the very end you have to it's a little
bit<00:02:43.420> sloppy<00:02:43.780> at<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.080> very<00:02:44.290> end<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.769> i<00:02:45.730> just

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
bit sloppy at the very end so i just

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.100 
bit sloppy at the very end so i just
start<00:02:46.450> at<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.570> very<00:02:46.660> end<00:02:47.380> now<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:49.269> know<00:02:49.959> it's

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
start at the very end now so I know it's

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.780 
start at the very end now so I know it's
not<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.320> way<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.620> usually<00:02:50.769> tape<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.190> stick<00:02:51.549> but

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
not the way you usually tape a stick but

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.789 
not the way you usually tape a stick but
it's<00:02:52.600> how<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.780> make<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:53.110> work<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.709> put

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
it's how I make it work so you just put

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.460 
it's how I make it work so you just put
it<00:02:57.100> at<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.489> very<00:02:57.640> end<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.930> reason<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.320> do

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
it at the very end and the reason you do

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.640 
it at the very end and the reason you do
that<00:02:59.500> bottom<00:03:00.010> part<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:02.230> start

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
that bottom part is so you can start

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.440 
that bottom part is so you can start
close<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.549> edge<00:03:03.670> we<00:03:03.940> don't<00:03:04.120> have<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.330> be

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
close to the edge we don't have to be

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.080 
close to the edge we don't have to be
exactly<00:03:05.290> on<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.470> edge<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.670> will<00:03:06.880> still

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
exactly on the edge and it will still

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.630 
exactly on the edge and it will still
have<00:03:07.239> tape<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.980> edge<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.430> toes<00:03:09.610> you

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
have tape on the edge of the toes you

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.729 
have tape on the edge of the toes you
see<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.810> that's<00:03:10.930> why<00:03:11.110> you<00:03:11.170> put<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.470> bottom

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
see so that's why you put the bottom

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.740 
see so that's why you put the bottom
part<00:03:11.890> on<00:03:12.100> there<00:03:12.269> if<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.540> were<00:03:13.690> wondering<00:03:15.750> then

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
part on there if you were wondering then

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.940 
part on there if you were wondering then
after<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:18.150> tape<00:03:19.150> over<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.720> end<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.739> tone

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
after that tape over the end of the tone

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
after that tape over the end of the tone
again<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:25.080> right<00:03:26.080> now

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
again and right now

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.600 
again and right now
and<00:03:27.660> then<00:03:28.110> yeah<00:03:28.980> right<00:03:29.190> now<00:03:29.340> I'm<00:03:29.430> just<00:03:29.460> going

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
and then yeah right now I'm just going

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:46.100 
and then yeah right now I'm just going
to<00:03:29.730> tear<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:40.100> all<00:03:41.100> right<00:03:42.110> so<00:03:43.550> now<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:45.000> have<00:03:45.840> this

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
to tear it all right so now I have this

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.350 
to tear it all right so now I have this
here<00:03:47.180> upside<00:03:48.180> down<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.600> have<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:50.180> right<00:03:51.180> now

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
here upside down I have this right now

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.800 
here upside down I have this right now
and<00:03:53.660> I'm<00:03:54.660> just<00:03:54.720> gonna<00:03:55.020> tape<00:03:55.800> from<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.780> heel<00:03:57.780> to

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
and I'm just gonna tape from the heel to

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.330 
and I'm just gonna tape from the heel to
the<00:03:58.080> toe<00:03:58.760> like<00:03:59.760> normal<00:04:00.740> because<00:04:01.740> I<00:04:01.830> think<00:04:01.920> it

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
the toe like normal because I think it

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.140 
the toe like normal because I think it
might<00:04:02.820> just<00:04:02.850> come<00:04:03.600> out<00:04:03.780> better<00:04:04.050> is<00:04:04.910> it's<00:04:05.910> like

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
might just come out better is it's like

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.910 
might just come out better is it's like
this<00:04:06.420> it's<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.900> straight<00:04:07.230> line<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:07.800> it's

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
this it's a straight line so it's

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.010 
this it's a straight line so it's
basically<00:04:08.160> like<00:04:08.640> you're<00:04:08.880> starting<00:04:09.510> off<00:04:09.690> a

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
basically like you're starting off a

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.480 
basically like you're starting off a
straight<00:04:10.980> line<00:04:11.160> if<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.490> have<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:12.470> straight<00:04:13.490> toe

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
straight line if you have a straight toe

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.910 
straight line if you have a straight toe
instead<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.570> a<00:04:15.630> rounded<00:04:15.959> one<00:04:16.170> you<00:04:16.769> have<00:04:16.890> a

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
instead of a rounded one you have a

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.440 
instead of a rounded one you have a
straight<00:04:17.190> toe<00:04:17.340> it's<00:04:17.519> basically<00:04:17.850> like<00:04:18.030> taping

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
straight toe it's basically like taping

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.110 
straight toe it's basically like taping
just<00:04:18.630> like<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.959> or<00:04:19.230> if<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:20.010> don't<00:04:20.669> tip<00:04:20.970> the

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
just like that or if you don't tip the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.580 
just like that or if you don't tip the
end<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.480> toe<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.780> basically<00:04:22.169> taping<00:04:22.470> like

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
end of the toe is basically taping like

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.380 
end of the toe is basically taping like
that<00:04:22.800> just<00:04:23.640> thought<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.500> so<00:04:26.330> sorry<00:04:27.330> if
