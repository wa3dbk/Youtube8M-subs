00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
by well I don't know the answer to the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.209 
by well I don't know the answer to the
question<00:00:32.700> but<00:00:32.910> clearly<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.480> war<00:00:34.040> weapons<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
question but clearly in a war weapons of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.760 
question but clearly in a war weapons of
war<00:00:35.399> do<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.910> captured<00:00:36.210> by<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:36.930> side<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.649> then

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
war do get captured by one side and then

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.950 
war do get captured by one side and then
used<00:00:38.070> against<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> other<00:00:38.790> side<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
used against the other side so it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.650 
used against the other side so it
wouldn't<00:00:40.230> surprise<00:00:40.410> me<00:00:40.680> if<00:00:41.340> British<00:00:42.239> weapons

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
wouldn't surprise me if British weapons

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.630 
wouldn't surprise me if British weapons
had<00:00:42.870> fallen<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.680> hands<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> Taliban

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
they say that casual the truth is the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.060 
they say that casual the truth is the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.910 
first casualty in war when you go to war
truth<00:01:02.940> ceases<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> factor<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
truth ceases to be a factor in the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.500 
truth ceases to be a factor in the
thinking<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.400> anybody<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
thinking of anybody they just want to

undoubtedly<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.840> are<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.140> doing<00:01:43.500> very<00:01:43.530> well

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
undoubtedly we are not doing very well

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.340 
undoubtedly we are not doing very well
in<00:01:44.250> Afghanistan<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.180> think<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.990> Afghans

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
in Afghanistan and I I think the Afghans

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.130 
in Afghanistan and I I think the Afghans
are<00:01:46.560> entitled<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.159> their<00:01:47.369> independence<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
are entitled to their independence and I

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.450 
are entitled to their independence and I
take<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.649> view<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.890> Britain<00:01:50.430> should

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
take the view that Britain should

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.260 
take the view that Britain should
withdraw<00:01:50.939> from<00:01:51.149> Afghanistan<00:01:51.890> but<00:01:53.090> in<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
withdraw from Afghanistan but in the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.450 
withdraw from Afghanistan but in the
circumstances<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.229> which<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.380> find<00:01:55.770> ourselves

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
circumstances in which we find ourselves

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.179 
circumstances in which we find ourselves
I<00:01:57.360> don't<00:01:57.659> always<00:01:57.840> believe<00:01:58.170> what<00:01:58.530> I'm<00:01:58.710> told<00:01:58.950> by

anybody because I try to get down to the
root<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> matter<00:02:02.280> why<00:02:02.700> are<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.270> there<00:02:03.570> and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
root of the matter why are we there and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.490

I<00:02:09.479> believe<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:10.080> should<00:02:10.110> withdraw<00:02:10.500> if<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.489> do

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
I believe we should withdraw if we do

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.869 
I believe we should withdraw if we do
withdraw<00:02:12.150> then<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> risk<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.989> mention<00:02:13.470> about

withdraw then the risk you mention about

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.920 
withdraw then the risk you mention about
terrorists<00:02:14.879> being<00:02:15.120> released<00:02:15.390> from<00:02:15.569> prison

question why we're there I believe it's

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.699 
question why we're there I believe it's
been<00:02:21.360> suggested<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.840> British<00:02:22.170> MPs<00:02:22.500> could

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
been suggested that British MPs could

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.170 
been suggested that British MPs could
soon<00:02:22.920> be<00:02:23.069> voting<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.849> country's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
deployment there in Afghanistan what do

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.620 
deployment there in Afghanistan what do
you<00:02:26.790> think<00:02:26.940> if<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.150> vote<00:02:27.330> didn't<00:02:27.540> actually

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630

happen what would it achieve anything

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.540 
happen what would it achieve anything
well<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.200> think<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.739> vote<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> House<00:02:32.340> of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.229 
Commons this week is a very important
one<00:02:34.620> because<00:02:34.980> it's<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.250> first<00:02:35.430> opportunity

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
one because it's the first opportunity

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.780 
one because it's the first opportunity
that<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.349> House<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.680> Commons<00:02:37.860> has<00:02:38.250> had<00:02:38.519> to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
that the House of Commons has had to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.390 
that the House of Commons has had to
have<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> vote<00:02:39.299> on<00:02:39.569> whether<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:40.799> should<00:02:40.830> be<00:02:41.220> in

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
Afghanistan or not and if there was a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
substantial vote against the war then it

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.250 
substantial vote against the war then it
would<00:02:47.610> alter<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.090> whole<00:02:48.390> argument<00:02:48.630> about

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
would alter the whole argument about

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.740 
would alter the whole argument about
British<00:02:49.650> policy<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.760> naturally<00:02:51.239> hurt

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
British policy so I naturally hurt

so much of what we read in the media
there<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:58.380> mounting<00:02:58.590> opposition<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.400> war

sure but are you fairly optimistic that

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.080 
sure but are you fairly optimistic that
there<00:03:03.959> could<00:03:04.170> be<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.290> very<00:03:04.590> heavy<00:03:04.799> vote<00:03:05.090> against

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
there could be a very heavy vote against

think<00:03:10.530> what's<00:03:10.890> really<00:03:10.980> interesting<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:12.239> that

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
think what's really interesting is that

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.420 
think what's really interesting is that
over<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.780> years<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.349> stop<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.889> war<00:03:14.069> movement
