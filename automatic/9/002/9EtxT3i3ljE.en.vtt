00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
repercussions of what you're doing so we

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.420 
repercussions of what you're doing so we
kind<00:02:46.439> of<00:02:46.500> stopped<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:46.919> we<00:02:47.069> slowed<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.280> down

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
