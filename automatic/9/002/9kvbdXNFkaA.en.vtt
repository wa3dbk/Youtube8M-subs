00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
bottom I recorded it via the speakers on

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.819 
bottom I recorded it via the speakers on
a<00:00:31.619> microphone<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.570> me<00:00:33.810> playing<00:00:34.470> over

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
a microphone and this is me playing over

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.069 
a microphone and this is me playing over
the<00:00:34.949> top<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.699> again<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.300> isn't<00:00:36.539> this

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the top of it so again this isn't this

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.740 
the top of it so again this isn't this
is<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.620> camera<00:00:38.160> microphone<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.210> I'll<00:00:39.300> do<00:00:39.539> this

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
is the camera microphone so I'll do this

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.990 
is the camera microphone so I'll do this
again<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.469> little<00:00:40.710> later<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.460> show<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
again a little later to show you the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.560 
again a little later to show you the
sound<00:00:42.210> difference<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.429> an<00:00:44.550> example

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.389 

no<00:00:48.570> that's<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:49.769> own<00:00:49.949> on<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> top<00:00:52.219> because<00:00:53.219> this

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
no that's my own on the top because this

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.340 
no that's my own on the top because this
part<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.999> song<00:00:54.269> doesn't<00:00:54.870> actually<00:00:54.989> have

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
part of the song doesn't actually have

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.829 
part of the song doesn't actually have
any<00:00:55.530> drum<00:00:55.859> click<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.089> so<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
any drum click to it so it's just on the

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.020 
any drum click to it so it's just on the
snare<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.530> rim<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.550> what's<00:00:59.760> nice<00:00:59.999> about

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
snare on the rim and what's nice about

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.260 
snare on the rim and what's nice about
this<00:01:00.510> oh<00:01:01.670> yeah<00:01:02.839> moved<00:01:03.839> out<00:01:04.050> what<00:01:04.739> I'm<00:01:04.890> playing

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
this oh yeah moved out what I'm playing

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.310 
this oh yeah moved out what I'm playing
or<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:08.100> move<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.479> song<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> listen<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
or I can move out the song and listen to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.830 
or I can move out the song and listen to
myself<00:01:10.470> playing<00:01:11.009> there<00:01:14.299> just<00:01:15.299> let<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.630> run<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
myself playing there just let it run a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.690 
myself playing there just let it run a
second<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> go

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.740 

again<00:01:23.570> I<00:01:24.610> was<00:01:25.610> good<00:01:25.909> about<00:01:26.030> recording

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
again I was good about recording

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:37.130 
again I was good about recording
yourself<00:01:26.869> now

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.450 

so<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.230> good<00:01:38.440> thing<00:01:38.470> about<00:01:38.680> recording

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
so the good thing about recording

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.310 
so the good thing about recording
yourself<00:01:39.850> over<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.420> top<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.870> song<00:01:41.080> like

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
yourself over the top of a song like

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.380 
yourself over the top of a song like
this<00:01:41.500> as<00:01:41.800> I'm<00:01:42.340> saying<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:42.760> can<00:01:42.910> do<00:01:43.030> this<00:01:43.210> with

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
this as I'm saying you can do this with

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.900 
this as I'm saying you can do this with
one<00:01:43.420> microphone<00:01:44.080> if<00:01:44.290> it's<00:01:44.500> just<00:01:44.800> for<00:01:45.550> yourself

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
one microphone if it's just for yourself

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.480 
one microphone if it's just for yourself
to<00:01:46.120> learn<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.630> tighten<00:01:47.020> up<00:01:47.080> as<00:01:47.260> a<00:01:47.290> drummer<00:01:47.620> you

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.580 
to learn to tighten up as a drummer you
play<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:49.000> song<00:01:49.240> in<00:01:49.510> your<00:01:49.780> earphones<00:01:50.290> you

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
draw them together that's a little

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.700 
draw them together that's a little
difficult<00:01:55.150> pulling<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.200> weight<00:01:56.350> bands

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
difficult pulling the weight bands

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.240 
difficult pulling the weight bands
together<00:01:56.980> to<00:01:57.280> line<00:01:57.580> up<00:01:57.790> correct<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.530> then<00:02:00.100> you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
together to line up correct and then you

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.910 
together to line up correct and then you
listen<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.730> yourself<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.360> see<00:02:01.570> if<00:02:02.560> there<00:02:02.800> are

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
listen to yourself and see if there are

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.340 
listen to yourself and see if there are
things<00:02:03.130> that<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:03.400> can<00:02:03.580> improve<00:02:03.910> an<00:02:04.630> example

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
things that you can improve an example

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.970 
things that you can improve an example
is<00:02:05.560> making<00:02:06.490> sure<00:02:06.730> that<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:07.570> sound<00:02:07.840> waves<00:02:08.140> look

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
is making sure that the sound waves look

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.760 
is making sure that the sound waves look
pretty<00:02:09.490> proportional<00:02:10.300> as<00:02:10.480> you<00:02:11.290> go<00:02:11.500> along

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
pretty proportional as you go along

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.710 
pretty proportional as you go along
unless<00:02:12.190> obviously<00:02:12.640> your<00:02:12.790> accent<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.510> and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
unless obviously your accent in and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.530 
unless obviously your accent in and
change<00:02:13.990> in<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.230> mood<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:15.100> music<00:02:15.550> but<00:02:16.390> in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
change in the mood of the music but in

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.470 
change in the mood of the music but in
general<00:02:16.990> it<00:02:17.170> should<00:02:17.200> be<00:02:17.620> fairly<00:02:18.010> consistent

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
general it should be fairly consistent

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.350 
general it should be fairly consistent
with<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.600> beatitude<00:02:20.140> you're<00:02:20.380> doing<00:02:20.740> um<00:02:21.360> you

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
with the beatitude you're doing um you

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.820 
with the beatitude you're doing um you
can<00:02:22.510> listen<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.780> yourself<00:02:23.080> put<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.530> over<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
can listen to yourself put it over the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.770 
can listen to yourself put it over the
music<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.430> then<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.060> could<00:02:25.240> tell<00:02:25.420> if<00:02:25.630> your

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
music and then you could tell if your

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
I like as I said in in other videos I

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.090 
I like as I said in in other videos I
like<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:55.190> snare<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.700> snaps<00:03:56.800> but<00:03:57.800> I<00:03:57.830> actually

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
like a snare that snaps but I actually

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.400 
like a snare that snaps but I actually
prefer<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.580> snare<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.300> mine<00:03:59.510> and<00:03:59.840> then<00:04:00.140> on<00:04:00.290> the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
prefer the snare of mine and then on the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.680 
prefer the snare of mine and then on the
record<00:04:01.480> okay<00:04:05.320> that's<00:04:06.320> it

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
record okay that's it

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:16.010 
record okay that's it
last<00:04:08.290> night

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.570 

and<00:04:16.590> then<00:04:16.739> at<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.550> end<00:04:17.580> of<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.850> song<00:04:19.580> so

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.280 
and then at the end of the song so
hopefully<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:21.510> that<00:04:21.980> was<00:04:23.000> acceptable<00:04:24.000> for
