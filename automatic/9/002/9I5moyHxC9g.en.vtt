00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
last one I basically had a little glitch

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.609 
last one I basically had a little glitch
in<00:01:12.150> my<00:01:12.210> back<00:01:12.390> arm<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> come<00:01:13.260> down<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
in my back arm so if you come down and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.630 
in my back arm so if you come down and
you<00:01:13.680> go<00:01:13.799> straight<00:01:14.010> through<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> shell<00:01:14.490> like

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
you go straight through the shell like

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.770 
you go straight through the shell like
this<00:01:14.790> basically<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.360> come<00:01:15.479> through<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.720> you

this basically you come through and you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.170 
this basically you come through and you
make<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> bank<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.549> reason<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.030> was

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
make the bank so the reason I was

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.670 
make the bank so the reason I was
sharing<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.720> little<00:01:18.960> thing<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.350> starting

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
sharing that little thing and starting

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.289 
sharing that little thing and starting
out<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:19.830> by<00:01:20.130> baking<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.640> call<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.970> sight

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
out just by baking we call this a sight

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.929 
out just by baking we call this a sight
and<00:01:21.420> shoot<00:01:21.600> banking<00:01:22.020> system<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:23.040> did<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
and shoot banking system I did that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.789 
and shoot banking system I did that
pretty<00:01:24.060> much<00:01:24.330> automatically<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.170> made<00:01:25.409> seven

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
pretty much automatically I made seven

pretty<00:01:34.350> much<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.710> beat<00:01:34.860> everybody<00:01:35.189> when

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
pretty much going to beat everybody when

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you start to shoot those bank shots I

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.050 
you start to shoot those bank shots I
did<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> notice<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> was

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
did this as you notice what I was

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.670 
did this as you notice what I was
talking<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.689> reason<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.079> was<00:01:40.200> doing<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
talking now the reason I was doing that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
talking now the reason I was doing that
it<00:01:40.799> goes<00:01:40.890> back<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.250> some<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.490> our<00:01:41.520> mental<00:01:41.850> tips

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it goes back to some of our mental tips

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.569 
it goes back to some of our mental tips
I<00:01:42.360> was<00:01:42.990> trying<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> keep<00:01:43.560> my<00:01:43.770> left<00:01:43.979> brain<00:01:44.189> busy

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
I was trying to keep my left brain busy

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.090 
I was trying to keep my left brain busy
by<00:01:44.759> talking<00:01:45.350> focusing<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> talking<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
by talking focusing on the talking the

story I was trying to tell you about the
banks<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.590> then<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.549> basically<00:01:51.119> my<00:01:51.509> right

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
banks and then I basically my right

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.819 
banks and then I basically my right
brain<00:01:51.899> was<00:01:52.049> releasing<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.619> shot

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
brain was releasing the shot

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.350 
brain was releasing the shot
automatically<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.820> when<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.149> release

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
automatically and when you can release

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.609 
automatically and when you can release
the<00:01:54.509> Scheldt<00:01:54.750> automatically<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> right

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
the Scheldt automatically the right

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.039 
the Scheldt automatically the right
brain<00:01:55.890> takes<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.759> M&amp;M<00:01:57.210> principle<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:58.020> has

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
brain takes that M&amp;M principle which has

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.420 
brain takes that M&amp;M principle which has
been<00:01:58.320> ingrained<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.040> from<00:01:59.189> prior

been ingrained in there from prior

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.160 
been ingrained in there from prior
segments<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.540> releases<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
segments and it releases it

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.660 
segments and it releases it
automatically<00:02:01.680> called<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.100> death<00:02:02.280> stroke<00:02:02.490> of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
automatically called the death stroke of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.520 
automatically called the death stroke of
banking<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> want<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.170> aware<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
better not leave you a bank shot so this

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.160 
better not leave you a bank shot so this
