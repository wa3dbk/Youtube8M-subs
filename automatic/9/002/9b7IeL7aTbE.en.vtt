we needed very very safely but I wanted
to<00:00:47.129> talk<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:47.399> something<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.690> idea<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
to talk about something a idea for a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.709 
to talk about something a idea for a
series<00:00:50.640> i<00:00:50.789> wanted<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.270> everyone's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719

series i wanted to get everyone's
thoughts<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.739> i<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.309> people<00:00:53.940> will

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
thoughts on it and i think people will

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.470 
thoughts on it and i think people will
enjoy<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.480> basically<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.739> idea<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.760> we

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
enjoy it basically my idea is that we

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360 
enjoy it basically my idea is that we
have<00:00:57.690> some<00:00:57.989> kind<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.500> random<00:00:59.070> number

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
have some kind of random number

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.510 
have some kind of random number
generator<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.090> amp<00:01:00.780> 15<00:01:01.260> 20<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:02.399> would

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
generator and amp 15 20 and I we would

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.570 
generator and amp 15 20 and I we would
basically<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> live<00:01:03.799> commentary<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
basically do a live commentary of the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.000 
basically do a live commentary of the
two<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.880> us<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.299> having<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.990> random<00:01:07.470> class<00:01:07.740> we

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
two of us just having a random class we

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.130 
two of us just having a random class we
pick<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> class<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.670> random<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.600> both<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.930> us

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
pick a class at random that both of us

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620 
pick a class at random that both of us
use<00:01:10.470> whether<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.490> might<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.909> same<00:01:12.330> class

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
use whether that might be the same class

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
use whether that might be the same class
or<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> different<00:01:13.320> class<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.460> we

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
or a different class and then we

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
or a different class and then we
basically<00:01:14.970> try<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> top<00:01:15.930> 10<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
basically try to get in the top 10 and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.920 
basically try to get in the top 10 and
for<00:01:17.159> every<00:01:17.369> point<00:01:17.700> where<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.810> it's

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
for every point where we have like it's

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.080 
for every point where we have like it's
some<00:01:19.049> kind<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.350> point<00:01:19.680> system<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.369> for

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
some kind of like point system and for

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.539 
some kind of like point system and for
every<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:21.840> position<00:01:22.409> past<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.040> top<00:01:23.220> 10

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
every you know position past the top 10

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
every you know position past the top 10
that<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> two<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> us<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.290> an

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that the two of us get we get like an

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.350 
that the two of us get we get like an
extra<00:01:25.650> point<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.040> something<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:27.150> every

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
extra point or something and for every

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.630 
extra point or something and for every
kill<00:01:27.630> past<00:01:27.990> say<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.530> seven<00:01:28.829> or<00:01:29.130> something<00:01:29.310> we

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
kill past say like seven or something we

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.340 
kill past say like seven or something we
get<00:01:29.729> an<00:01:29.820> extra<00:01:29.939> point<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.780> basically<00:01:31.140> it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
get an extra point and basically it

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.830 
get an extra point and basically it
would<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> 10<00:01:32.310> game<00:01:33.090> series<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
would just be a 10 game series a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
would just be a 10 game series a
10-episode<00:01:34.320> series<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.549> try<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.790> see

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
10-episode series and we just try to see

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.760 
10-episode series and we just try to see
how<00:01:36.240> many<00:01:36.390> points<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.560> those

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
how many points we can get with those

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
how many points we can get with those
random<00:01:38.130> classes<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:39.090> might<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.479> some<00:01:39.780> you

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
random classes we might have some you

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.410 
random classes we might have some you
know<00:01:40.110> good<00:01:40.530> classes<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.310> might<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.640> some<00:01:41.850> bad

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
know good classes we might have some bad

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.990 
know good classes we might have some bad
classes<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.979> would<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.189> basically<00:01:44.399> test

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
classes but it would just basically test

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120 
classes but it would just basically test
our<00:01:45.180> skills<00:01:45.360> at<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.750> game<00:01:45.990> test<00:01:46.350> our<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.100> know

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
our skills at the game test our you know

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
our skills at the game test our you know
our<00:01:47.280> patients<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.240> stuff<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:49.020> well

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
our patients and stuff like that as well

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.190 
our patients and stuff like that as well
as<00:01:49.350> our<00:01:49.500> skill<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.579> will<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.930> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
as our skill if you will and that's I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.600 
as our skill if you will and that's I
think<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.530> would<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.710> pretty<00:01:52.890> cool<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.220> think

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
think it would be pretty cool I think

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.130 
think it would be pretty cool I think
would<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.000> would<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.119> live<00:01:54.390> commentary<00:01:54.990> but

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
would be it would be live commentary but

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.170 
would be it would be live commentary but
we<00:01:55.290> cut<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> lot<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.829> parts<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.969> think

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
we cut a lot of parts out and I think

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.120 
we cut a lot of parts out and I think
that'd<00:01:57.329> be<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.960> fun<00:01:58.259> idea<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that'd be a really fun idea for a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.190 
that'd be a really fun idea for a
serious<00:01:59.640> let<00:01:59.939> me<00:02:00.030> know<00:02:00.149> your<00:02:00.299> thoughts<00:02:00.329> back

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
serious let me know your thoughts back

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200 
serious let me know your thoughts back
to<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.439> gameplay<00:02:01.680> really<00:02:02.189> quickly<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:03.090> can

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
to the gameplay really quickly you can

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.230 
to the gameplay really quickly you can
see<00:02:03.479> amp<00:02:03.960> actually<00:02:04.560> timed<00:02:05.009> out<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.939> server

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
see amp actually timed out the server

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.869 
see amp actually timed out the server
was<00:02:06.600> being<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.320> little<00:02:07.350> laggy<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.759> was<00:02:08.849> a

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
was being a little laggy and that was a

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.969 
was being a little laggy and that was a
huge<00:02:09.209> deal<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:09.720> game<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.709> over<00:02:10.890> I

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
huge deal in this game but I go over I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.890 
huge deal in this game but I go over I
kill<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> chicken<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.030> that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
kill the chicken and that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.589 
kill the chicken and that
episerver<00:02:13.439> boost<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.250> then<00:02:14.549> I<00:02:14.790> actually<00:02:15.090> end

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
episerver boost and then I actually end

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.990 
episerver boost and then I actually end
up<00:02:15.989> killing<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.379> guy<00:02:16.560> very<00:02:16.860> very<00:02:17.069> easily<00:02:17.280> we

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
up killing that guy very very easily we

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.429 
up killing that guy very very easily we
go<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.360> feast<00:02:18.599> no<00:02:18.900> one<00:02:19.049> else<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.319> around

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
go to the feast no one else is around

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.410 
go to the feast no one else is around
and<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.310> think<00:02:20.370> people<00:02:20.670> were<00:02:20.939> really<00:02:21.120> having

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
and I think people were really having

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.479 
and I think people were really having
some<00:02:21.810> connection<00:02:22.349> problems<00:02:22.829> the<00:02:23.310> entire

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
some connection problems the entire

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.490 
some connection problems the entire
server<00:02:23.879> was<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.420> fist<00:02:24.930> deep<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.319> actually

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
server was a fist deep and I actually

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.380 
server was a fist deep and I actually
got<00:02:25.799> really<00:02:26.010> lucky<00:02:26.189> we<00:02:26.849> didn't<00:02:27.060> really<00:02:27.180> have

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
got really lucky we didn't really have

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.059 
got really lucky we didn't really have
any<00:02:27.569> I<00:02:27.750> mean<00:02:27.930> have<00:02:28.140> too<00:02:28.349> many<00:02:28.470> too<00:02:28.920> much

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
any I mean have too many too much

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.759 
any I mean have too many too much
problems<00:02:29.579> but<00:02:30.120> we<00:02:30.450> do<00:02:30.599> blow<00:02:30.870> up<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.079> feast<00:02:31.379> and

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
problems but we do blow up the feast and

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.099

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
and you can see these guys are lagging

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.140 
and you can see these guys are lagging
out<00:03:07.769> left<00:03:08.129> and<00:03:08.250> right<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.849> kind<00:03:09.090> of

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
out left and right it's kind of

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.059 
out left and right it's kind of
unfortunate<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.379> don't<00:03:10.530> really<00:03:10.650> think<00:03:10.920> we

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
unfortunate and I don't really think we

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.339 
unfortunate and I don't really think we
would<00:03:11.189> have<00:03:11.280> had<00:03:11.400> too<00:03:11.579> much<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.939> hard<00:03:12.150> time

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
would have had too much of a hard time

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.839 
would have had too much of a hard time
