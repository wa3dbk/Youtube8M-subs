00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.830 
it's better if you're consistent anyway
because<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.400> can<00:04:51.550> land<00:04:51.759> stuff<00:04:52.570> when<00:04:52.720> you're

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
because you can land stuff when you're

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.529 
because you can land stuff when you're
filming<00:04:53.110> or<00:04:53.650> taking<00:04:53.680> pictures<00:04:54.360> or<00:04:55.360> anything

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
filming or taking pictures or anything

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.770 
filming or taking pictures or anything
like<00:04:55.750> that<00:04:55.810> it's<00:04:56.139> way<00:04:56.259> easier<00:04:57.210> but<00:04:58.210> at<00:04:58.240> EDD<00:04:58.509> it

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
like that it's way easier but at EDD it

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.550 
like that it's way easier but at EDD it
definitely<00:04:59.229> takes<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.620> lot<00:05:00.009> of<00:05:00.039> time<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:01.560> like

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
definitely takes a lot of time and like

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.430 
definitely takes a lot of time and like
hardware<00:05:03.070> it<00:05:03.160> to<00:05:03.250> be<00:05:03.370> consistent<00:05:03.729> like<00:05:04.030> that

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
hardware it to be consistent like that

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.600 
hardware it to be consistent like that
