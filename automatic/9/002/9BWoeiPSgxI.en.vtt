00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.290 

well<00:00:01.050> I<00:00:01.079> did<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.469> few<00:00:02.210> circuitry<00:00:03.210> and

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
well I did a few circuitry and

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.260 
well I did a few circuitry and
continuity<00:00:03.899> tests<00:00:04.290> on<00:00:04.440> this<00:00:04.589> 1990<00:00:05.580> Mercury

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
continuity tests on this 1990 Mercury

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.540 
continuity tests on this 1990 Mercury
Grand<00:00:06.330> Marquis<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.230> found<00:00:07.919> out<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.220> the

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
Grand Marquis and found out that the

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.640 
Grand Marquis and found out that the
problem<00:00:08.910> with<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.090> was<00:00:09.420> not<00:00:09.599> because<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.019> mice

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
problem with it was not because of mice

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.030 
problem with it was not because of mice
and<00:00:10.980> rodents<00:00:11.309> not<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.500> wiring<00:00:13.500> which<00:00:13.799> may

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
and rodents not on the wiring which may

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.039 
and rodents not on the wiring which may
have<00:00:14.160> also<00:00:14.519> included<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.089> fuel<00:00:15.360> pump<00:00:15.570> wiring

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
have also included the fuel pump wiring

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.650 
have also included the fuel pump wiring
but<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.250> was<00:00:17.400> making<00:00:18.359> perfect

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
but that it was making perfect

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.179 
but that it was making perfect
continuity<00:00:19.500> from<00:00:20.390> from<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> relayed<00:00:21.840> point

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
continuity from from the relayed point

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.950 
continuity from from the relayed point
over<00:00:23.189> all<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> way<00:00:23.850> over<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.529> fuel<00:00:25.529> pump

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
over all the way over to the fuel pump

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.040 
over all the way over to the fuel pump
so<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:27.990> meant<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.380> had<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> look<00:00:28.830> elsewhere

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
so that meant I had to look elsewhere

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.490 
so that meant I had to look elsewhere
the<00:00:31.050> problem<00:00:32.059> was<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.090> before<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.809> car<00:00:34.140> was

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the problem was that before this car was

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.350 
the problem was that before this car was
actually<00:00:34.890> towed<00:00:35.160> here<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:37.430> decided<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.790> try<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
actually towed here I decided to try to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.260 
actually towed here I decided to try to
swap<00:00:39.750> out<00:00:40.070> this<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:43.260> big<00:00:43.590> cable<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.550> big

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
swap out this this big cable this big

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.170 
swap out this this big cable this big
high<00:00:45.750> power<00:00:46.140> cable<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.710> swap<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.000> that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
high power cable to swap the one that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.930 
high power cable to swap the one that
came<00:00:48.450> out<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.629> here<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.260> put<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.739> into<00:00:49.980> my<00:00:50.129> 1982

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
came out of here and put it into my 1982

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.840 
came out of here and put it into my 1982
Mustang<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:52.020> which<00:00:52.890> had<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> pretty<00:00:53.610> badly

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
Mustang that which had a pretty badly

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.479 
Mustang that which had a pretty badly
corroded<00:00:54.120> wire<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.600> process<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.489> had

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
corroded wire and in the process I had

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.029 
corroded wire and in the process I had
to<00:00:59.609> disconnect<00:01:00.090> all<00:01:00.359> these<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:01.199> cables

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
to disconnect all these little cables

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.810 
to disconnect all these little cables
and<00:01:02.190> wirings<00:01:03.650> from<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> main<00:01:04.949> battery<00:01:05.280> point

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and wirings from the main battery point

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.170 
and wirings from the main battery point
and<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> process<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.470> disconnected<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
and in the process I disconnected the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.160 
and in the process I disconnected the
fuel<00:01:09.479> pump<00:01:10.070> connection<00:01:11.070> which<00:01:11.900> was<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
fuel pump connection which was in the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
fuel pump connection which was in the
first<00:01:13.409> place<00:01:13.740> connected<00:01:14.460> by<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> tiny<00:01:15.060> little

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
first place connected by a tiny little

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.100 
first place connected by a tiny little
wire<00:01:16.520> which<00:01:17.520> was<00:01:17.670> no<00:01:17.850> no<00:01:18.509> more<00:01:18.840> no<00:01:19.080> less

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
wire which was no no more no less

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
wire which was no no more no less
actually<00:01:19.920> then<00:01:20.360> then<00:01:21.360> 16<00:01:21.990> maybe<00:01:22.380> 18<00:01:22.860> gauge<00:01:23.189> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
actually then then 16 maybe 18 gauge and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.850 
actually then then 16 maybe 18 gauge and
it<00:01:24.270> had<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> little<00:01:24.750> connector<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.619> which

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
it had a little connector on which

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.679 
it had a little connector on which
looked<00:01:26.189> looked<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.119> these<00:01:27.330> only

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
looked looked like one of these only

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.620 
looked looked like one of these only
smaller<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.939> thought<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> was<00:01:30.329> supposed<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
smaller and I thought it was supposed to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.210 
smaller and I thought it was supposed to
be<00:01:30.750> bigger<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.650> supposed<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.950> go<00:01:32.100> on

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
be bigger because it's supposed to go on

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.679 
be bigger because it's supposed to go on
them

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
them

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.569 
them
that<00:01:33.689> post<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.310> had<00:01:35.430> that

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that post but because it had that

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.120 
that post but because it had that
smaller<00:01:35.880> connector<00:01:36.390> I'm<00:01:36.570> thinking<00:01:36.990> well<00:01:37.950> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
smaller connector I'm thinking well it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.890 
smaller connector I'm thinking well it
doesn't<00:01:38.340> really<00:01:38.460> go<00:01:38.850> there<00:01:39.090> because<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
doesn't really go there because it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.710 
doesn't really go there because it
obviously<00:01:40.110> has<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.590> go<00:01:40.829> somewhere<00:01:41.070> else<00:01:41.720> what

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
obviously has to go somewhere else what

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.630 
obviously has to go somewhere else what
just<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.110> turned<00:01:43.320> out<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> last<00:01:44.159> guy<00:01:44.280> who

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.450 

put<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.299> intended<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.220> wedge<00:01:50.220> it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
put that in there intended to wedge it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.190 
put that in there intended to wedge it
between<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:51.090> those<00:01:51.270> connectors<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.049> that

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
between all those connectors in that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.789 
between all those connectors in that
point

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
point

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.249 
point
so<00:01:53.369> now<00:01:53.579> I'd<00:01:53.820> answer<00:01:54.060> my<00:01:54.299> question<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> what

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
so now I'd answer my question as to what

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.100 
so now I'd answer my question as to what
that<00:01:55.439> what<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.219> piece<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.549> wire<00:01:56.759> was<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.479> why

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that what that piece of wire was and why

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.450 
that what that piece of wire was and why
the<00:01:58.170> car<00:01:58.439> wouldn't<00:01:58.649> even<00:01:58.950> run<00:01:59.659> so<00:02:00.659> now<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.460> just

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the car wouldn't even run so now I just

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.179 
the car wouldn't even run so now I just
got<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.850> install<00:02:03.329> another<00:02:03.719> piece<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.740> wiring

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
got to install another piece of wiring

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.670 
got to install another piece of wiring
with<00:02:05.340> some<00:02:05.549> thick<00:02:05.790> 12<00:02:06.210> gauge<00:02:06.509> wire<00:02:06.560> with<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
with some thick 12 gauge wire with the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.710 
with some thick 12 gauge wire with the
proper<00:02:08.069> size<00:02:08.280> connection<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:09.000> it

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
proper size connection on it

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.200 
proper size connection on it
-<00:02:11.230> those<00:02:11.410> two<00:02:11.440> yellow<00:02:11.830> wires<00:02:12.160> exposed<00:02:12.670> out

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
- those two yellow wires exposed out

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.300 
- those two yellow wires exposed out
there<00:02:13.240> one<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:13.870> which<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.440> fuel<00:02:14.830> pump<00:02:15.070> wire

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
there one of which is the fuel pump wire

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.450 
there one of which is the fuel pump wire
I<00:02:15.340> don't<00:02:15.730> know<00:02:15.820> what<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.180> other<00:02:16.330> one<00:02:16.540> was<00:02:17.460> but

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
I don't know what the other one was but

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.000 
I don't know what the other one was but
it<00:02:19.770> connects<00:02:20.770> with<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.940> same<00:02:22.090> circuit

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
it connects with it in the same circuit

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.740 
it connects with it in the same circuit
-<00:02:24.010> into<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.430> mystery<00:02:24.910> circuit<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.540> don't

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
- into a mystery circuit that I don't

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.870 
- into a mystery circuit that I don't
know<00:02:25.870> what<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.410> probably<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.370> fuel<00:02:27.730> pump

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
know what it is probably a fuel pump

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.290 
know what it is probably a fuel pump
regulator<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.570> them<00:02:28.810> I'm<00:02:28.990> not<00:02:29.470> sure<00:02:30.300> but

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
regulator on them I'm not sure but

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.120 
regulator on them I'm not sure but
whatever<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:31.780> if<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.200> connect<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:32.620> up<00:02:32.950> it

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
whatever it is if I connect that up it

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.790 
whatever it is if I connect that up it
should<00:02:33.370> run<00:02:35.220> okay<00:02:36.220> I'm<00:02:36.340> all<00:02:36.490> set

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
should run okay I'm all set

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.320 
should run okay I'm all set
hope<00:02:38.800> this<00:02:38.950> battery<00:02:39.340> holds<00:02:39.760> out<00:02:39.880> because<00:02:40.180> it

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
hope this battery holds out because it

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.590 
hope this battery holds out because it
just<00:02:40.510> came<00:02:40.690> out<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.140> car<00:02:41.440> no<00:02:42.160> not<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.390> long
