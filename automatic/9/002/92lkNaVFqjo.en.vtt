00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.990
 nest of common linnets in the garden 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.620
 is 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.410
 here you see a nest built on top of 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.869
 a trellis that was in the area more 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.810
 frequented from the garden because we 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.280
 we were usually below the 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.529
 trellis in the shelter of the sun 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.170
 here you see a chick outside the nest 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.140
 Well, maybe I'm not so good 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.000
 and the parents when they are out of the nest 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.000
 many times they watch from above 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.409
 so we realized that it could be a 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.409
 match 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.020
 enough actions 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.100
 We were not sure of the age 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.400
 but he looks like an adult 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.600
 and that is a jerk watch the tail 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.600
 one 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.899
 and the party also flies like 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.899
 vitamins the minimums below 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:38.229
 we discussed if it could be a red color 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.490
 which like the Linnet flies a 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.280
 little by little 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.579
 here you see some nest boxes for 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.090
 insectivores distributed by the rest 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.090
 of the garden 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.530
 here you see the female opening her beak 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.530
 because that day was very hot 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.479
 and one of the differences between the holy 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.390
 reds and the linnet in the absence of the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.120
 red cop is much darker is that the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.390
 hallway usually makes the kilos to lower 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.390
 height 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.349
 usually done almost level with the ground in 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.349
 some bushes 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.140
 with that missed them at first that 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.140
 out a toothpick 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.330
 parents usually watched from 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.330
 the rooftop 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.380
 here we see a chick outside the nest 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.970
 and josh from the hies the bower 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:15.140
 very hollow and it's dangerous for them 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.160
 can be dropped by any of the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.830
 holes and this is what happened a chick 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.000
 finally it fell and we were 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:29.020
 because right next to it he remained immobile 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.470
 subject to one of the stems of the vine and 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:36.260
 We opted to leave him he did not know how to fly but 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.830
 as soon as we approached he ran away and 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.000
 he hid among some flower boxes and 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.000
 it was impossible to catch them 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.090
 now 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.950
 he came back 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.090
 and all he got was to hide 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.600
 in us the mother is watching is 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.600
 seeing everything 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.239
 goodbye 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.810
 this has been all 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.940
 I hope you liked it
