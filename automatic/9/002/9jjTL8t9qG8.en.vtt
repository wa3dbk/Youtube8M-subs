00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.610
 I welcome viewers of my channel to me 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.880
 Often correspondence in messages set 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.490
 questions and the crux of the matter is that those 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.890
 technologies that I show too much 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.820
 are complex 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.410
 what to repeat them 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.710
 equipment needed 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.010
 today I want to show the most 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.359
 primitive lathe 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.559
 well, more primitive 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:39.360
 it is only a hand-held machine with a beam 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.469
 driven this will become assembled engine from 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.750
 homemade wooden washing machine 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.550
 faceplates 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.190
 plywood bracket in which is inserted 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.180
 turning center from lathe 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.420
 surely somebody will say 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.289
 rotating center also need to have 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:06.030
 you can use a non-rotating center 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:09.119
 can take screwed piece 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.909
 studs sharpen it on a cone 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:18.659
 electro sharpened same and use in 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.280
 as a center the machine can be very 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.280
 simple 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:28.740
 but reach the point of absurdity in primitiveness 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:32.520
 he also doesnâ€™t want i am demonstrating 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.140
 very simple methods on the elementary 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.009
 equipment can start 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:44.280
 Well, then the choice is yours or you will 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:50.240
 I will do it myself either buy it 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.240
 desire now I will show in work 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.640
 and here is such a way with 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.640
 steel wire 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.640
 is done 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.430
 decorative fit 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:42.870
 and that's what I did and now 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:45.720
 very briefly about the machine itself 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.370
 machine is a pine board sorokovka 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:54.500
 which is cut at an angle of 30 degrees 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.650
 up and cut two slots for clamps 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.380
 back grandma 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.750
 it is a collection of three 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.349
 plywood plates and inserts in between 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.220
 such a structure that is screwed 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:14.459
 I changed the height of the board because 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.970
 I was changing the engine however I did not 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:21.109
 hit the same height so i 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.840
 just put this design on 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.460
 wagon carriage 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.970
 here I have used rotating 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.550
 Centre 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.550
 but as I said you can do without it 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:40.950
 self-made plywood faceplate 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:45.389
 a piece of bakelite plywood here inside 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:49.940
 plate with clamping bolt and 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:53.220
 on 3 screws here is such a trident 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.970
 everything is elementary everything is simple even 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.090
 primitive 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:01.110
 but by no means products are far from 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:05.330
 primitive such simple technology 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:08.400
 and that 's all thank you all for your attention 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.150
 subscribe to my channel 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.560
 read the description of the video and see you in 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.560
