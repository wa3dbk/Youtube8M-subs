difficult to quickscope there whenever

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.160 
difficult to quickscope there whenever
we<00:01:58.710> get<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> new<00:01:59.310> game<00:01:59.579> they<00:02:00.509> complain<00:02:00.930> and

we get to the new game they complain and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.440 
we get to the new game they complain and
the<00:02:01.890> game<00:02:02.100> hasn't<00:02:02.310> even<00:02:02.460> come<00:02:02.670> out<00:02:02.820> yet<00:02:02.880> have

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the game hasn't even come out yet have

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.770 
the game hasn't even come out yet have
you<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.590> able<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.159> try<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.600> game

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
you you have to be able to try the game

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.150 
you you have to be able to try the game
first<00:02:07.049> before<00:02:07.409> you're<00:02:07.530> able<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.890> complain

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
first before you're able to complain

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.990 
first before you're able to complain
about<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
about it

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.600 
about it
that's<00:02:09.390> my<00:02:09.600> theory<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.310> look<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.460> God

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that's my theory and look to God

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.550 
that's my theory and look to God
remember<00:02:12.030> don't<00:02:12.630> find<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.930> way<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.080> do<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.380> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
remember don't find a way to do it and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.960 
remember don't find a way to do it and
they<00:02:13.950> didn't<00:02:14.190> have<00:02:14.310> aim<00:02:14.490> assist<00:02:14.760> at<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
they didn't have aim assist at the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.730 
they didn't have aim assist at the
reveal<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:15.930> probably<00:02:16.110> gonna<00:02:16.320> be<00:02:16.380> easier

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
reveal so it's probably gonna be easier

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.290 
reveal so it's probably gonna be easier
for<00:02:16.770> them<00:02:17.010> once<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.400> game<00:02:17.580> actually<00:02:17.790> comes

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
for them once the game actually comes

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.540 
for them once the game actually comes
out<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:19.350> let<00:02:19.890> me<00:02:19.920> know<00:02:20.040> what<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.220> guys<00:02:20.310> think

should<00:02:20.940> they<00:02:21.090> make<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.960> easier<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.350> quickscope

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
should they make it easier to quickscope

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.680 
should they make it easier to quickscope
