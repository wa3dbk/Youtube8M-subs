village<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:01.770> in<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:01.920> clip<00:00:02.070> I'm<00:00:02.460> going<00:00:02.490> to

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
village and in this clip I'm going to

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.050 
village and in this clip I'm going to
show<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.060> throw<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.419> loop<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.959> head<00:00:04.230> loop

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
show you how to throw a loop a head loop

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.330 
show you how to throw a loop a head loop
to<00:00:06.060> make<00:00:06.089> your<00:00:06.359> head<00:00:06.509> loop<00:00:06.750> you<00:00:06.960> just<00:00:07.189> like<00:00:08.189> I'm

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
to make your head loop you just like I'm

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.060 
to make your head loop you just like I'm
structured<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:08.970> previous<00:00:09.360> clip<00:00:10.070> you

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
structured in the previous clip you

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.589 
structured in the previous clip you
start<00:00:11.370> out<00:00:11.550> with<00:00:11.639> your<00:00:11.790> loop<00:00:11.940> regular<00:00:12.450> and

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
start out with your loop regular and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.150 
start out with your loop regular and
just<00:00:12.750> kind<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.019> whirl<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.410> around<00:00:13.469> there<00:00:13.920> when

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
just kind of whirl it around there when

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.110 
just kind of whirl it around there when
you<00:00:14.250> run<00:00:14.400> out<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.580> room

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
you run out of room

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.720 
you run out of room
take<00:00:15.389> another<00:00:15.660> coil<00:00:16.220> your<00:00:17.220> head<00:00:17.369> loops<00:00:17.580> are

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
take another coil your head loops are

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.580 
take another coil your head loops are
going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.910> be<00:00:18.029> quite<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> bit<00:00:18.750> smaller<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.500> you

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
going to be quite a bit smaller so you

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.720 
going to be quite a bit smaller so you
want<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.830> shorten<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.250> up<00:00:20.990> and<00:00:22.279> then<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> swing

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
want to shorten it up and then the swing

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.410 
want to shorten it up and then the swing
you<00:00:23.760> rope

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
you rope

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.950 
you rope
you<00:00:25.380> come<00:00:25.590> through<00:00:25.800> from<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.580> left<00:00:26.960> when

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
you come through from right to left when

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.450 
you come through from right to left when
you<00:00:27.990> swing<00:00:28.380> over<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.890> want<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.250> able<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
you swing over you want to be able to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.370 
you swing over you want to be able to
kiss<00:00:29.640> your<00:00:29.849> hand<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.840> you're<00:00:30.960> swinging<00:00:31.349> your

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
kiss your hand and you're swinging your

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.030 
kiss your hand and you're swinging your
rope<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.570> swinging<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.710> pretend

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
rope so I just swinging it just pretend

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.410 
rope so I just swinging it just pretend
you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.280> kiss<00:00:35.489> your<00:00:35.670> hand<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.120> that's<00:00:36.210> going

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
you can kiss your hand and that's going

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420 
you can kiss your hand and that's going
to<00:00:36.480> keep<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:36.870> loop<00:00:37.140> open<00:00:37.770> that's<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> most

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
to keep your loop open that's the most

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.069 
to keep your loop open that's the most
important<00:00:38.940> thing<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.300> having<00:00:39.510> an<00:00:39.690> open<00:00:39.750> loop

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
important thing is having an open loop

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.440 
important thing is having an open loop
whenever<00:00:40.410> you're<00:00:40.590> roping<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.180> when<00:00:42.329> you're

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
whenever you're roping so when you're

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.299 
whenever you're roping so when you're
practicing<00:00:42.629> at<00:00:43.020> home<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.410> practice<00:00:43.950> coming

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
practicing at home just practice coming

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.310 
practicing at home just practice coming
around<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:44.820> hand<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.870> kissing<00:00:46.110> your

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
around with your hand and kissing your

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.350 
around with your hand and kissing your
hand<00:00:46.440> every<00:00:46.770> time<00:00:46.820> whatever<00:00:47.820> you're<00:00:48.059> coming

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
hand every time whatever you're coming

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.350 
hand every time whatever you're coming
around<00:00:48.570> not<00:00:48.719> really<00:00:49.910> overdoes<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:50.940> quite<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
around not really overdoes it quite a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.540 
around not really overdoes it quite a
bit<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.829> principle<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.399> just

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
bit but it's the principle is just

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.299 
bit but it's the principle is just
keeping<00:00:53.879> your<00:00:53.940> loop<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.420> open<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.309> then

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
keeping your loop really open and then

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.350 
keeping your loop really open and then
when<00:00:56.399> you're<00:00:56.520> ahead<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.879> whatever<00:00:57.090> you're

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
when you're ahead and whatever you're

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.450 
when you're ahead and whatever you're
throwing<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.690> hand<00:00:57.899> loop<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.980> come<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
throwing a hand loop you come out of the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.330 
throwing a hand loop you come out of the
box<00:00:59.640> whenever<00:01:00.210> your<00:01:00.420> horses<00:01:00.989> shoulder<00:01:01.410> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
box whenever your horses shoulder is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.060 
box whenever your horses shoulder is
parallel<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.270> steers<00:01:03.600> hip<00:01:03.960> you'll<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.979> on

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
parallel to the steers hip you'll be on

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.120 
parallel to the steers hip you'll be on
the<00:01:05.159> left<00:01:05.400> side<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> steer<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:07.500> start<00:01:07.830> you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
the left side of the steer you start you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.469 
the left side of the steer you start you
start<00:01:08.159> swinging<00:01:08.670> your<00:01:08.939> rope<00:01:09.119> as<00:01:09.330> you're

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
start swinging your rope as you're

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.600 
start swinging your rope as you're
riding<00:01:09.659> up<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> steer<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.460> head

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
riding up to the steer then as your head

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.490 
riding up to the steer then as your head
horse<00:01:11.820> gets<00:01:12.210> right<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.720> steer<00:01:13.110> where<00:01:13.380> his

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
horse gets right to the steer where his

horse gets right to the steer where his
shoulders<00:01:13.920> parallel<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> steers<00:01:14.909> help

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
shoulders parallel with the steers help

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.480 
shoulders parallel with the steers help
you<00:01:15.960> deliver<00:01:16.350> your<00:01:16.560> loop

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you deliver your loop

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.430 
you deliver your loop
swinging<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> head<00:01:18.630> rope<00:01:18.840> you're<00:01:19.049> swinging

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
swinging the head rope you're swinging

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.109 
swinging the head rope you're swinging
out<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.890> front<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.760> pointing

out here in front and kind of pointing
towards<00:01:21.390> your<00:01:21.479> target<00:01:22.010> then<00:01:23.010> when<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.250> get<00:01:23.400> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
towards your target then when you get to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.830 
towards your target then when you get to
your<00:01:23.790> delivery<00:01:24.299> point<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.890> release<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
your delivery point you just release and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.540 
your delivery point you just release and
point<00:01:27.840> your<00:01:28.020> point<00:01:28.530> your<00:01:28.710> finger<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
steers bottom ride home and this will

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.830 
steers bottom ride home and this will
just<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.909> send<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> rope<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.630> around

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
just kind of send you to rope one around

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.499 
just kind of send you to rope one around
your<00:01:34.080> right<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.770> left<00:01:34.979> motion<00:01:35.580> will<00:01:36.330> naturally

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
your right to left motion will naturally

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.570 
your right to left motion will naturally
send<00:01:37.050> that<00:01:37.170> rope<00:01:37.350> around<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.800> steers<00:01:38.070> horns

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580
