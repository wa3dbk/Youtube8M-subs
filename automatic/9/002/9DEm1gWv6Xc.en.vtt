00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Erwan!

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:02.700
Erwan, wake up!

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.500
Let's go, the camera's rolling!

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.000
Hi everybody, welcome to Color My Skin

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.400
After the World Tattoo Convention, we're now at French Graffiti

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.520
Boris and Elie will tell us about their art and passion

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.580
So come with me, let's meet them!

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.280
Boris, thanks for inviting us here,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.580
We're inside French Graffiti

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.520
We opened the shop almost 4 years ago

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.880
You started working in Meaux (77)

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.440
You were an apprentice there

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.660
So why did you choose to settle in Paris?

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.020
Because it was the rightest choice

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.740
According to what we wanted to do and where we lived

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.260
and Paris is a nice city

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.820
Regarding the customers and the variety of demands

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.466
Why the name "French Graffiti"?

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.140
Because we love the american 50's culture

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.220
and it's an obvious reference to the movie "American Graffiti"

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.120
But of course, being french, we adapted the name

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.260
and because Mathy works on nail art.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.020
it's often called "french manucure"

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.380
Why did you decide to create two separate atmospheres?

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.580
Because I love the diner-like furniture

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.760
but also the "Tiki-pop" culture

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.640
The Hawaiian culture as seen in the USA during the 1950's

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.620
So the diner atmosphere goes well with the tattoo world

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.840
also with the hygiene and the general aspect

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.680
and the more relaxing part on the other side

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.603
for the nail art room

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.240
So you buy pens and markers there?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.060
Yes, markers and pens

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.940
Some personal stuff as well, they have many products.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.520
I get my framing equipment there.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.180
I like tinkering, I have rebuilt a few motorcycles.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.400
Frame, engine and everything.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500
I have built a chopper as well.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.320
It's a different way to express myself,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.060
I love the idea of creating something  from scratch

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.440
How did you get the envy to go from the food industry to being a tattoo artist?

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.320
It's a long introspection that led me there.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.940
I think; the main idea was to customize things,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.060
Drawing is great but on a piece of paper; it's not alive.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.600
Whereas on the skin it will be part of a living body

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.780
That's where it came from.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.240
Also I felt unfulfilled in my old job

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.120
I didn't like the perspectives it could offer me.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.780
If you give yourself a chance and seize the right opportunities, eventually it all works out.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.820
You took the plunge and hoped for the best.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.180
Unfortunately, not many people can say that,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.420
But to me; finding your way is...

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.640
You're a lot more fulfilled now than before

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.280
Absolutely

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.540
You know...

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.500
Being good at this without passion; that's just not possible.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.080
Yes, it seems obvious.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.620
That's not possible.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.260
My style is...

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.160
I like many different things,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.540
Often, people ask me

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.062
Do you prefer black and white or color?

00:03:38.062 --> 00:03:39.720
and I answer that I love color;

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.480
and I also love black and white.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.140
I like thick lines; I like thin lines as well.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.560
I like solid colored shapes and details.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.420
All of this is combined in my works,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.080
The thing that defines me the most;

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.260
and what I like to do,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.460
is making tattoos that fit perfectly the subject.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.780
After a first session, it looks nice!

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.660
It went well!

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.760
In my opinion,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.500
it's the most important thing.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.260
It's designed on paper but meant to be on a body.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.460
It has to live, breath and evolve with the movements.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.900
My best customers are the ones wearing tattoos that you can actually see "live".

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.880
My drawings are made for a particular person and spot

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.960
Not for anyone else.

00:04:33.212 --> 00:04:35.212
It's custom-made.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.640
If the person wants to change the spot,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.100
Almost every time, I have to re-do the drawing.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.480
Or if I have to change some part of the compostion,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.320
It can sometimes change everything because the balance is off and it doesn't look good anymore.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.840
I try my best to get people involved in the conception of their tattoos.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.300
This way; as years pass by

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.740
They'll still look at it with satisfaction.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.440
Because they helped creating it,

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.760
and it really means something to them.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.140
it doesn't always have to be a deep message or idea.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.760
Sometimes you can be lightly

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.660
You can do something serious without taking yourself seriously.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.620
The main objective is,

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.300
is esthetics.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.960
If you do something, you should do it well,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.360
so put everything in it.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.640
Have it all.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.740
Something you like, that looks good;

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.720
In the style that you want.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.740
I think, that's the spirit.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.700
So you can say my style is quite adaptive.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.760
Because I make it work for each person.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.680
And I put a lot of myself into it.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.400
And I try to have a recognizable style.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.240
By how I draw lines,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.820
or the way I color the skins.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.780
Knowing that Mathy does nail art, is she training on your fingers on sundays?

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.520
It actually happened a few times...

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.040
And I wore her creations with pride and joy.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.880
But it's something that can totally be adapted for guys as well.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.220
It's a fashion accessory like any other,

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.960
That could become a trend without being girly.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.080
and it can be the vector of cool messages.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.880
Are there any tattoo artists,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.700
that you liked working with on your own tattoos?

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.680
Of course. By being a tattoo artist myself,

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.460
I've been inked by people that I like and admire the work.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.820
But the human side is also important.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.000
Can you tell us which tattoo artists you like to follow ?

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.880
Some of the Actual celebrities; but they've earned it because their work is unbelievable.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.660
They roll at a level so high...

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.760
and create art that is so powerful,

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.320
you can only look up to them. And it's very inspiring.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.620
What kind of advice would you give to a beginner?

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.820
Something that is important in your opinion when you start this kind of job.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.880
Simply; work a lot.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.940
And never forget the person who's wearing your creation.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.160
My personal world is all about what you can see around here.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.840
It's more inspired by the spirit of,

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.580
surrealistic stuff.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.880
A bit absurd or offbeat and funny.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.360
This is my little friend,

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.120
I love these characters,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.400
They're part of an american underground culture.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.700
It actually takes a lot of space in my life,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.340
and goes perfectly well with the idea of the shop.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.280
You better watch the show buddy!

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.271
and you come visit us at French Graffiti!

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:48.469

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:50.160
and next time we'll meet Elie Hammond.
