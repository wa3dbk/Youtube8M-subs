00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
doing that already so it shouldn't in

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.279 
doing that already so it shouldn't in
the<00:00:46.980> long<00:00:47.219> run<00:00:47.520> limit<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.270> activity<00:00:48.480> however

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
in the short run soon after the the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.660

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
device has been implanted it takes time

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.299 
device has been implanted it takes time
for<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.030> body<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.930> heal<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.620> sort<00:00:56.190> of

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
for the body to heal and sort of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.700 
for the body to heal and sort of
solidify<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.120> device<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.870> place<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.469> sense

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
solidify the device in place in a sense

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.939 
solidify the device in place in a sense
so<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.280> there's<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.670> lot<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.739> healing<00:01:01.739> that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
so that there's a lot of of healing that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.960 
so that there's a lot of of healing that
takes<00:01:02.190> place<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.730> makes<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.710> stability<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
takes place that makes the stability of

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
takes place that makes the stability of
the<00:01:05.970> device<00:01:06.299> increase<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> course<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the device increase in the course of the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.620 
the device increase in the course of the
first<00:01:08.159> three<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.670> four<00:01:08.880> weeks<00:01:09.119> following<00:01:09.570> an

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.850 
shoulder to do so gently so for example
when<00:01:48.240> you're<00:01:48.329> putting<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> shirt<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.619> do

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
when you're putting on a shirt just do

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.330 
when you're putting on a shirt just do
so<00:01:50.070> slowly<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.290> being<00:01:52.290> aware<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:53.040> that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so slowly and being aware that that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.280 
so slowly and being aware that that
device<00:01:53.790> shouldn't<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.299> agitated<00:01:54.930> too<00:01:55.079> much

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
device shouldn't be agitated too much

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.289 
device shouldn't be agitated too much
that<00:01:55.890> should<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:56.280> sufficient<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.969> allow<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that should be sufficient to allow the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.080 
that should be sufficient to allow the
device<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.750> heal<00:01:58.200> completely<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.189> place<00:01:59.729> over

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
device to heal completely in place over

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.780 
device to heal completely in place over
the<00:02:00.360> course<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> next<00:02:01.049> month<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:02.340> another

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the course of the next month so another

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.639 
the course of the next month so another
thing<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.030> patients<00:02:03.689> often<00:02:04.170> want<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.469> know

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
thing that patients often want to know

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.459 
thing that patients often want to know
is<00:02:05.280> whether<00:02:05.670> or<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:06.030> their<00:02:06.689> device<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.320> at

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
is whether or not their device is at

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.199 
is whether or not their device is at
risk<00:02:07.710> with<00:02:07.890> interference<00:02:08.640> from<00:02:08.910> other

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
risk with interference from other

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.440 
risk with interference from other
electrical<00:02:09.959> systems<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.069> for<00:02:11.370> example

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
electrical systems so for example

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.180 
electrical systems so for example
the<00:02:12.599> most<00:02:12.810> common<00:02:13.380> far<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:13.890> away<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.040> most

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the most common far and away the most

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.760 
the most common far and away the most
common<00:02:14.610> thing<00:02:14.819> everyone<00:02:15.450> will<00:02:15.569> ask<00:02:15.720> me<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.170> doc

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
common thing everyone will ask me is doc

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.160 
common thing everyone will ask me is doc
what<00:02:17.459> about<00:02:17.489> microwaves<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.870> one<00:02:19.020> thing

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
what about microwaves and the one thing

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.470 
what about microwaves and the one thing
I<00:02:19.260> say<00:02:19.440> about<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.099> everybody<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:21.300> say

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
I say about that to everybody is I say

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.960 
I say about that to everybody is I say
just<00:02:21.959> don't<00:02:22.200> get<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.739> microwave<00:02:23.160> now<00:02:23.640> of

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
just don't get in the microwave now of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.120 
just don't get in the microwave now of
course<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.420> leads<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.440> great<00:02:25.950> deal<00:02:26.069> of

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
course this leads to a great deal of

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.070 
course this leads to a great deal of
laughing<00:02:26.489> at<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.640> time<00:02:26.849> but<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.870> truth

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
laughing at the time but but the truth

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.720 
laughing at the time but but the truth
of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> matter<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.800> these<00:02:29.100> systems<00:02:29.550> have

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
of the matter is that these systems have

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.270 
of the matter is that these systems have
become<00:02:29.850> very<00:02:30.840> sophisticated<00:02:31.230> over<00:02:31.590> time<00:02:31.739> so

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
become very sophisticated over time so

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.220 
become very sophisticated over time so
they're<00:02:32.430> very<00:02:32.459> well<00:02:32.850> shielded<00:02:33.750> from

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
they're very well shielded from

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.229 
they're very well shielded from
electrical<00:02:34.770> interference<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.910> doesn't

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
electrical interference that doesn't

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.640 
electrical interference that doesn't
mean<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.690> don't<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.110> be<00:02:37.230> cognizant

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
mean that you don't have to be cognizant

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.190 
mean that you don't have to be cognizant
of<00:02:37.920> certain<00:02:38.310> electrical<00:02:38.790> fields<00:02:39.180> very<00:02:39.900> high

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
of certain electrical fields very high

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.740 
of certain electrical fields very high
intensity<00:02:40.769> electrical<00:02:41.400> fields<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:42.360> have<00:02:42.660> an

intensity electrical fields can have an

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.790 
intensity electrical fields can have an
effect<00:02:43.019> on<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.290> device<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.250> for<00:02:44.489> example

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
effect on the device so for example

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.500 
effect on the device so for example
patients<00:02:46.800> who<00:02:47.069> use<00:02:47.510> electromagnetic

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510
