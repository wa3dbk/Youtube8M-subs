00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.100
 swimming is a complete sport that 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.040
 it requires concentration and much 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.700
 discipline like the one Daniela handle 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.010
 kings and matías riffo representatives of 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.170
 Italian stadiums and that also coexist 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.440
 daily hallways of the faculty 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.410
 of medicine at the University of Chile 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.080
 both showed off on pc daniela and 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.050
 Matías promised about 800 points 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.230
 and make studies compatible with 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.230
 sport 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.960
 the annotation of an organization 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.130
 I believe and a way of life that allows you 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.110
 at the university to have a pace of 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.770
 very different life then one arrives 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.700
 as with a different scheme then 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.950
 nothing to follow with the organization 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.000
 studying when using all 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.280
 the times when I have it at that 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.350
 to be able to do all the activity 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.660
 that make us be organized as 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.230
 said the danger 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.170
 you have to be very organized to know what 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.460
 time to swim in what time to study what 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.550
 rest time that is super 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.550
 important 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.380
 but as I say it's a race that if 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.230
 well the sport some believe it's more 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.930
 heavy in truth the sport helps you 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.670
 because it delivers a delivery order a 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.400
 rigor of knowing that you have to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.710
 do things always that you do not get 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.330
 You may be behind in the studies in 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.330
 the projects that you have to do 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.910
 if not 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.520
 how can they keep a good stride in 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.210
 the studies standing out the university 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.090
 and surrendering in the pool I mean 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.640
 I 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.460
 the two things help just because 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.960
 in the water that serves between shadows 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.840
 maybe longer like having a 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.610
 intelligence and how is it managing the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.050
 test in a way as adequate but 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.680
 It also serves a lot to studies as 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.330
 to clear up how to oxygenate the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.710
 brain even as in that sense 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.030
 also swimming helps a lot 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.170
 study I think the truth is that we 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.450
 he hears us a lot we continue 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.700
 and at least I think the two do not 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.230
 we are missing a lot or do not like 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.180
 we have a different schedule or nothing 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.750
 in the background we are like normal students in 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.920
 the university that 's what we expect 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.430
 maybe it 's like we're missing a test 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.250
 we can do them like this but not bigger 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.860
 as today, exceptions, we do not have 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.090
 I'm good and I have not had great 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.940
 problems 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.340
 I think that besides I love the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.040
 swimming I also love the theme of 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.680
 health of medicine then the bouquets 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.300
 that I have all the links in the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.700
 medicine and how there is something that I like 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.239
 as much as they can be heavy what 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.730
 Surrounded by the taste for the 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.099
 say it in some way for the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.459
 infatuated with the career then no 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.410
 it's not complex either and to close matías 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.300
 advises young people that in 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.980
 next months will give the psv test 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.340
 good those who are preparing to 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.340
 old age 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.780
 and there is little good and are already preparing and 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.260
 they studied what they should have 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.750
 studied and they have to concentrate 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.650
 just do not stay in foolishness in the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.030
 hard pc that is a work that if one is 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.700
 made for one to fall in frontiers 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.810
 no no it does not have a greater complexity than 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.450
 she 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.420
 for those who want to get into the 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.370
 university and keep doing sport 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.930
 Organize if you have a test in 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.739
 September they start studying from 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.490
 July since before do not leave everything up 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.200
 last minute 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.570
 that their work schedules are 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.500
 sacred that that is paramount 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.590
 order and have a head and concentrate 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.840
 in what one does and what one feels 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.300
 daniela reyes and matías riffo dos 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.820
 medical students who achieve 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:14.490
 perform in college and also 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.490
 grow athletically in the pool
