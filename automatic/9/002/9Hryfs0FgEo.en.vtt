00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hello
this is the presentation of the Lecher antenna EDD

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.000
It comes in an orange translucent plastic cover

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It comes with a mass and its connection wire

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and a short manual (not visible here)

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The antenna itself
- branches of 13,5 cm
- its basis is 6-6.5cm length
- 108gr

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The mass
- wire length is 54cm 
- 5.5cm diam 1.4cm height
- With 6 holes for 75gr

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Its branches are retractable
through a double screw system

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
unscrew the external 'nut', then the branch itself

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
finally, you move the branch to its final angle

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
then, screw the branch

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:56.000
and screw the 'nut'

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The branches are full (no hole in them)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The branches have a good length, 13.5cm, pratical for long hands

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The cursor moves well between the Lecher wires

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
There is no hole in the back of the plastic ruler (like Acmos)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The mass's wire get connected to the body of the antenne

00:01:52.001 --> 00:02:00.000
There is only one hole for this and it can be used in both direction

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:10.000
Branches are full, there is no room for a magnetized rod or a wire

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:16.000
Branches have a length of 13.5cm, 

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:23.000
The body has a length of 6-6.5cm

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:43.000
The weigth of the antenna is ~108gr

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:49.000
Global weight of the mass and its wire is 75gr
