00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
safety innovation for saving lives that

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.740 
safety innovation for saving lives that
we've<00:00:20.030> ever<00:00:20.210> seen

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.150 

it's<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.840> yoke<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.259> goes<00:00:25.439> over<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> drivers

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
it's a yoke that goes over the drivers

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.220 
it's a yoke that goes over the drivers
shoulders<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.820> their<00:00:27.390> straps<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.930> connect

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
shoulders and their straps that connect

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.689 
shoulders and their straps that connect
to<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.410> helmet<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.919> basically<00:00:29.430> it<00:00:29.580> helps

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
to the helmet and basically it helps

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.760 
to the helmet and basically it helps
protect<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.359> neck<00:00:30.599> during<00:00:30.840> an<00:00:31.020> impact<00:00:31.380> it's

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
protect the neck during an impact it's

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.950 
protect the neck during an impact it's
meant<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> take<00:00:32.369> away<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.790> snapping<00:00:33.270> forward

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
meant to take away that snapping forward

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.780 
meant to take away that snapping forward
and<00:00:34.110> trying<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> jerk<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.190> head<00:00:35.460> off<00:00:35.610> your

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
and trying to jerk the head off your

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.439

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
in 1981 Patrick Jacques Marg went off

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
in 1981 Patrick Jacques Marg went off
track<00:00:39.420> at<00:00:39.660> mid-ohio<00:00:39.900> and<00:00:40.350> hit<00:00:40.470> a<00:00:40.500> dirt<00:00:40.710> bank

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
track at mid-ohio and hit a dirt bank

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.100 
track at mid-ohio and hit a dirt bank
and<00:00:41.280> he<00:00:41.339> died<00:00:41.519> instantly<00:00:42.150> of<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.449> basilar<00:00:42.839> skull

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
and he died instantly of a basilar skull

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.579 
and he died instantly of a basilar skull
fracture

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
fracture

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.619 
fracture
clearly<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.339> was<00:00:44.370> an<00:00:44.640> injury<00:00:44.910> mechanism<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
clearly it was an injury mechanism that

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.290 
clearly it was an injury mechanism that
was<00:00:46.320> occurring<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:47.010> racing<00:00:47.610> elsewhere<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.210> we

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
was occurring in racing elsewhere and we

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
was occurring in racing elsewhere and we
were<00:00:48.420> worried<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.050> many<00:00:50.010> other<00:00:50.220> racers

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
were worried that many other racers

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.640 
were worried that many other racers
might<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.360> killed<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.750> way<00:00:51.900> so<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.170> came<00:00:52.320> up

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
might be killed this way so I came up

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.069 
might be killed this way so I came up
with<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> concept<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.519> a<00:00:53.610> Hans<00:00:53.820> device<00:00:54.079> from

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
with the concept of a Hans device from

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
with the concept of a Hans device from
the<00:00:55.140> very<00:00:55.410> beginning<00:00:55.890> testing<00:00:56.579> devices<00:00:57.030> in

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the very beginning testing devices in

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.900 
the very beginning testing devices in
lab<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:58.440> needed<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> get<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.219> pieces<00:00:59.489> of

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
lab we needed to get the right pieces of

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.250 
lab we needed to get the right pieces of
equipment<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> right<00:01:00.840> place<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
equipment at the right place at the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
equipment at the right place at the
right<00:01:01.350> time<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.090> logistics<00:01:03.090> has<00:01:03.210> always<00:01:03.390> been

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
right time so logistics has always been

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.650 
right time so logistics has always been
important<00:01:04.140> somewhere<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.160> 1990<00:01:06.030> they<00:01:06.330> started

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.910 
important somewhere on 1990 they started
a<00:01:06.720> company<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.170> they<00:01:07.229> started<00:01:07.560> selling<00:01:07.740> these

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
a company and they started selling these

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310 
a company and they started selling these
devices<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.149> nobody<00:01:09.929> bought<00:01:10.140> them

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
devices but nobody bought them

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
one of the big problems we had was

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.390 
one of the big problems we had was
getting<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> shape<00:01:28.350> rights<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:29.040> fit<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.469 
confined cockpits and we did a lot work
with<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> drivers<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> make<00:01:33.000> sure<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.299> they

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
with the drivers to make sure that they

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
could wear different sized drivers and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.039 
could wear different sized drivers and
