00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.650
 and with youtube people things because 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.060
 they are very, very good today, here your friend 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.589
 tarot cap commenting what a new 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.659
 video and as you can see today we are 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.419
 in theories about what possibly in you 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:14.489
 or meat died in batman arkham city ' and 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.740
 good to those who played harley dlc 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:19.500
 quinn revenge could appreciate that the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.480
 police officers said a bit curious 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.509
 which was that the joker's body 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.490
 disappeared and did not report it to 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.730
 avoid panic which does leave you 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.730
 thinking that as the body disappeared 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.590
 of the joker good one theory of mine is that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.660
 while Batman was rescuing the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.890
 police officers 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.649
 hurley could send thugs 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.540
 the corpse of the joker and the kidnapping 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.530
 it was just an alibi to call the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.590
 batman attention 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.960
 and good another fact that a friend told me 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.789
 called earth 26 infinite and that its 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.129
 channel will be in the description the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.050
 upload good content also from batman and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.360
 well what he told me was that 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.489
 once he heard the thugs say that 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.130
 It was never mud, it would not surprise me 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.500
 that there were two or three which also 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.700
 it may be true because mud face is 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.890
 can divide to create clones 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.259
 which is perhaps the joker we saw 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.740
 dying was just also a clone of it 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.920
 face beard 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.630
 another fact is that also to those who read 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 good comics I do not read comics but 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.340
 I also know from this that the joker could 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.130
 stop your heart at your own will 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.770
 to fake his death which also 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.140
 it may be true because the joker like 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.880
 you know attacked batman and well he I think 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.670
 he is not so stupid to drop the cure 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.670
 maybe all that was already planned for 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.240
 make batman feel like that with the guilt 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.930
 of the death of embocar 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.049
 and me but I just pretended that and could be 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.460
 preparing something bigger to destroy 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.030
 drop 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.220
 or another theory is that when the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.170
 joker corpse disappeared if 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.590
 the joker is really immune 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.450
 maybe they use the lanjarÃ³n pit and 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.209
 the pit of the waters for the prisoners 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.940
 ask with that they could revive the 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.950
 dead 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.070
 I could also heal someone 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.040
 I was dying so to speak 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.770
 because as you know, any race had a 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.950
 poor health in the middle of the campaign 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.580
 batman arkham city 'but then it 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.760
 submerges in the lacero and recovers its 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.500
 force and you have to beat 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.170
 and well that could also be a 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.970
 theory not to immerse the joker for 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.610
 relive it in the pit of lazarus 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.590
 those are some theories that I have and 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.460
 good if you liked the video please 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.470
 give him like that help too share 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.500
 the video to all the batman fans for 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.160
 that they find out and good soon such 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.350
 once I bring you a video about the good 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.380
 about possible indications of the sequel to 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.060
 arkham city ' and good subscribe to the channel 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.020
