00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
so I've got to make sure that gets right

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.489 
so I've got to make sure that gets right
what<00:01:45.569> I'm<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.929> is<00:01:46.049> put<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.289> old<00:01:46.439> one

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 
what I'm going to do is put the old one

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:49.160 
what I'm going to do is put the old one
back<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.889> place<00:01:47.100> temporarily<00:01:47.929> see<00:01:48.929> what<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
back in place temporarily see what the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289 
back in place temporarily see what the
clearance<00:01:49.499> was<00:01:49.679> measure<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.130> with<00:01:50.249> caliper<00:01:50.639> or

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
clearance was measure it with caliper or

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.920 
clearance was measure it with caliper or
the<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.170> logical<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.980 

Fila<00:01:56.930> gauges<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.000> figure<00:01:59.000> out<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.270> distance

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
Fila gauges and figure out the distance

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.630 
Fila gauges and figure out the distance
and<00:02:00.170> then<00:02:00.259> try<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.009> get<00:02:01.130> as<00:02:01.280> close<00:02:01.340> as

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
and then try and get as close as

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.639 
and then try and get as close as
possible<00:02:01.700> with<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.270> new<00:02:02.420> one<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:03.080> think<00:02:03.590> the

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
possible with the new one I think the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.899 
possible with the new one I think the
new<00:02:03.770> or<00:02:03.890> old<00:02:03.920> bearing<00:02:04.340> are<00:02:04.430> exactly<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.880> same

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
new or old bearing are exactly the same

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.639 
new or old bearing are exactly the same
because<00:02:05.240> they're<00:02:05.390> both<00:02:05.479> factory<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.530> that

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
because they're both factory so that

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:07.810 
because they're both factory so that
might<00:02:06.830> not<00:02:06.979> be<00:02:07.070> such<00:02:07.250> an<00:02:07.399> issue

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
might not be such an issue

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.669 
might not be such an issue
you<00:02:08.179> see<00:02:08.330> brains<00:02:08.599> gotten<00:02:08.929> into<00:02:09.080> everything<00:02:09.500> so

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
you see brains gotten into everything so

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.589 
you see brains gotten into everything so
if<00:02:09.860> we<00:02:09.950> give<00:02:10.069> everything<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.489> good<00:02:10.640> clean<00:02:10.910> and

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
if we give everything a good clean and

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.059 
if we give everything a good clean and
re<00:02:11.810> grease<00:02:12.050> before<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.500> goes<00:02:12.620> back<00:02:12.890> together

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
re grease before it goes back together

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.190 
re grease before it goes back together
some<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.030> parts<00:02:14.330> aren't<00:02:14.599> really<00:02:14.959> who

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
some of the parts aren't really who

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.259 
some of the parts aren't really who
fought<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.620> pin<00:02:15.830> but<00:02:16.819> was<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.120> other

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
fought the pin but was it the other

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.110 
fought the pin but was it the other
annoying<00:02:17.720> one<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:17.989> got<00:02:18.140> stuck<00:02:18.410> on<00:02:18.590> me<00:02:19.120> that's

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
annoying one that got stuck on me that's

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.220 
annoying one that got stuck on me that's
the<00:02:20.239> new<00:02:20.360> one<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:22.430> get<00:02:23.420> some<00:02:23.599> pieces<00:02:23.810> part

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
the new one and get some pieces part

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.840 
the new one and get some pieces part
seals<00:02:25.030> that's<00:02:26.030> one<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.390> top<00:02:26.599> caps<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:28.790> a

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
seals that's one of the top caps it's a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
seals that's one of the top caps it's a

here<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.110> let<00:02:33.319> grease<00:02:33.590> out<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.860> think<00:02:34.040> what<00:02:34.790> is

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
here to let grease out I think what is

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.190 
here to let grease out I think what is
that<00:02:34.910> Aaron<00:02:35.360> I'm<00:02:35.480> not<00:02:35.690> sure<00:02:35.840> I'm<00:02:35.959> gonna<00:02:36.110> have

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
that Aaron I'm not sure I'm gonna have

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.330 
that Aaron I'm not sure I'm gonna have
to<00:02:36.260> figure<00:02:36.410> out<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.739> how<00:02:36.860> goes<00:02:37.069> but<00:02:37.280> I'm

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
to figure out that how goes but I'm

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.670 
to figure out that how goes but I'm
going<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.549> replace<00:02:37.790> everything<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:39.140> should

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
going to replace everything and should

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.890 
going to replace everything and should
be<00:02:39.799> all<00:02:39.890> good<00:02:40.069> so<00:02:40.370> I'll<00:02:41.180> just<00:02:41.330> stop<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:41.690> for<00:02:41.810> a

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
be all good so I'll just stop this for a

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.640 
be all good so I'll just stop this for a
moment<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.350> keep<00:02:42.709> going<00:02:44.019> alright<00:02:45.019> I've<00:02:45.500> got<00:02:45.530> a

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
moment and keep going alright I've got a

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.030 
moment and keep going alright I've got a
little<00:02:45.860> bit<00:02:45.950> carried<00:02:46.130> away<00:02:46.720> we've<00:02:47.720> got<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
little bit carried away we've got the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.220 
little bit carried away we've got the
lock<00:02:49.040> pin<00:02:49.250> in<00:02:49.569> we<00:02:50.569> didn't<00:02:50.780> really<00:02:50.900> want<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.170> go

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
lock pin in we didn't really want to go

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.630 
lock pin in we didn't really want to go
in<00:02:51.380> too<00:02:51.530> well<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:51.860> it's<00:02:51.950> in<00:02:52.100> it's<00:02:52.370> locked

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
in too well but it's in it's locked

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.080 
in too well but it's in it's locked
everything<00:02:53.060> solid<00:02:54.640> I'm<00:02:55.640> going<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.849> do<00:02:55.940> now

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
everything solid I'm going to do now

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.339 
everything solid I'm going to do now
since<00:02:56.390> I'm<00:02:56.480> going<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.690> pump<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:56.959> up<00:02:57.080> full<00:02:57.260> of

grace until gray starts coming at the
top<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.090> bottle<00:02:59.299> and<00:02:59.769> make<00:03:00.769> sure<00:03:00.980> that

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
top of the bottle and make sure that

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.009 
top of the bottle and make sure that
it's<00:03:01.250> all<00:03:01.340> lubricated<00:03:01.970> properly<00:03:02.000> don't<00:03:02.810> want

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
it's all lubricated properly don't want

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:03.729 
it's all lubricated properly don't want
to<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.350> up

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
to that up

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.580 
to that up
make<00:03:04.370> sure<00:03:04.549> there's<00:03:04.760> no<00:03:05.049> sand<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.230> crap<00:03:06.440> in

make sure there's no sand and crap in

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.400 
make sure there's no sand and crap in
there<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:08.180> bearing<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.690> ended<00:03:08.900> up<00:03:08.959> having<00:03:09.170> to

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
there the bearing I ended up having to

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.240 
there the bearing I ended up having to
use<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:10.070> smallest<00:03:10.820> size<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.600> had<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:12.769> tried

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
use the smallest size that I had I tried

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.430 
use the smallest size that I had I tried
to<00:03:13.400> do<00:03:13.489> measurements<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.900> clearance<00:03:15.290> in

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
to do measurements and the clearance in

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.690 
to do measurements and the clearance in
there<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:16.010> small<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.459> was<00:03:16.549> almost

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
there is so small it was almost

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.789 
there is so small it was almost
impossible<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.480> measure<00:03:17.630> but<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.530> ended<00:03:18.739> up

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
impossible to measure but I ended up

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.349 
impossible to measure but I ended up
having<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.160> use<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.430> smaller<00:03:19.700> size<00:03:20.000> just<00:03:20.269> to

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
having to use the smaller size just to

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:21.430 
having to use the smaller size just to
get<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.570> together<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.959> wouldn't<00:03:21.200> go<00:03:21.290> together

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
get it together it wouldn't go together

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.500 
get it together it wouldn't go together
otherwise<00:03:21.829> it<00:03:22.130> was<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:23.000> wouldn't<00:03:23.209> be<00:03:23.269> able<00:03:23.390> to

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
otherwise it was you wouldn't be able to

while<00:04:37.800> I'm<00:04:37.919> getting<00:04:38.039> even<00:04:38.400> closer<00:04:39.020> got<00:04:40.020> the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
while I'm getting even closer got the

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.840 
while I'm getting even closer got the
tire<00:04:41.220> back<00:04:41.550> in<00:04:41.760> on<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:41.910> drag<00:04:42.240> link<00:04:42.830> I'm<00:04:43.850> fairly

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
tire back in on the drag link I'm fairly

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.670 
tire back in on the drag link I'm fairly
confident<00:04:45.449> all<00:04:45.630> my<00:04:45.750> clearance<00:04:46.110> is<00:04:46.289> a<00:04:46.320> correct

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
confident all my clearance is a correct

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.140 
confident all my clearance is a correct
because<00:04:46.979> Greece<00:04:47.340> is<00:04:47.370> coming<00:04:47.820> out<00:04:47.940> of<00:04:48.060> the

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
because Greece is coming out of the

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.060 
because Greece is coming out of the
bearing<00:04:48.449> so<00:04:49.260> that<00:04:49.350> means<00:04:49.530> at<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.740> table<00:04:50.010> to

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
bearing so that means at the table to

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.920 
bearing so that means at the table to
lubricate<00:04:50.550> that's<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.060> good<00:04:51.210> sign<00:04:51.449> I<00:04:51.720> think

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
lubricate that's a good sign I think

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.020 
lubricate that's a good sign I think
I've<00:04:52.889> actually<00:04:53.130> pumped<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.610> whole<00:04:53.789> thing

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
I've actually pumped the whole thing

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.290 
I've actually pumped the whole thing
full<00:04:54.180> of<00:04:54.330> grace<00:04:54.539> now<00:04:55.610> when<00:04:56.610> I<00:04:56.699> tighten<00:04:57.060> up<00:04:57.120> the

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
full of grace now when I tighten up the

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.180 
full of grace now when I tighten up the
bottom<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.960> pushed<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.590> whole<00:04:58.680> bunch<00:04:58.889> of<00:04:59.010> grease

up<00:04:59.400> out<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.729> through<00:04:59.940> so<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.150> know<00:05:00.270> it's<00:05:00.419> full

I also pump this top grease nipple until

I've<00:05:32.760> already<00:05:33.210> said<00:05:33.389> that<00:05:33.570> but<00:05:33.660> I'm<00:05:33.780> saying<00:05:33.990> it

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
I've already said that but I'm saying it

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.260 
I've already said that but I'm saying it
again<00:05:34.310> so<00:05:35.310> it's<00:05:35.430> now<00:05:35.550> time<00:05:35.610> to<00:05:35.789> put<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.060> brakes

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
again so it's now time to put the brakes

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.050 
again so it's now time to put the brakes
back<00:05:36.449> together<00:05:36.630> that's<00:05:37.560> probably<00:05:37.949> the<00:05:38.160> most

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
back together that's probably the most

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.490 
back together that's probably the most
time<00:05:39.270> consuming<00:05:39.330> bidders<00:05:40.020> to<00:05:40.050> put<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.349> rest

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
time consuming bidders to put the rest

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.610 
time consuming bidders to put the rest
of<00:05:40.620> this<00:05:40.710> back<00:05:40.919> together

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.080 
of this back together
it's<00:05:43.620> just<00:05:43.830> fiddly<00:05:44.130> put<00:05:44.430> the<00:05:44.520> brakes<00:05:44.729> back<00:05:44.910> on

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
it's just fiddly put the brakes back on
