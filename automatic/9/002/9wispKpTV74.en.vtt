looks like this from this you can

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.440 
looks like this from this you can
clearly<00:00:31.590> distinguish<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.460> beginning<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.090> an

end you might ask how do I know which is

the beginning and which is the end well
it<00:00:39.059> becomes<00:00:39.329> more<00:00:39.660> apparent<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.440> look<00:00:40.649> at

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it becomes more apparent when we look at

the rules of line standing are very
consistent<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.940> best<00:00:57.120> case<00:00:57.329> scenario<00:00:57.360> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
be a sign and this is a bit trickier you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.340 
be a sign and this is a bit trickier you
can<00:01:17.729> usually<00:01:17.970> tell<00:01:18.240> where<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> beginning<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
can usually tell where the beginning is

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.170 
can usually tell where the beginning is
based<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> direction<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.640> everyone<00:01:21.060> is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
based on the direction that everyone is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.030 
based on the direction that everyone is
facing<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> event<00:01:22.530> people<00:01:22.830> are

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
facing and in the event people are

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.590 
facing and in the event people are
trying<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> deceive<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.880> by<00:01:24.030> facing<00:01:24.420> many

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
trying to deceive you by facing many

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.929 
trying to deceive you by facing many
directions<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.890> usually<00:01:26.130> assume<00:01:26.700> that

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
directions you can usually assume that

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.399 
directions you can usually assume that
the<00:01:27.030> beginning<00:01:27.450> will<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.630> closest<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the beginning will be closest to the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410 
the beginning will be closest to the
destination<00:01:29.159> whether<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> store

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
will be the opposite side let's practice

will be the opposite side let's practice
shall<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.229> find<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.439> end<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> line
