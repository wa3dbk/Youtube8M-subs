 We are at night here in namibe where 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.829
 done to the times of the stage 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.710
 qualification the Argentine push-ups 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.629
 that was part of group b that is the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.339
 Forty-first World Championship 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.989
 of hockey on outer skate and has 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.210
 obtained a very important triumph 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.470
 against Uruguay going into quarters 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.870
 final this is like this 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.780
 this is how she has gotten it, I say 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.570
 I count the optimal performance nine 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.610
 units of three games played him 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.070
 he won France in the debut then he won 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.750
 Germany that has also specified the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.210
 airport pass the end winning from to 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.220
 Uruguay by a forceful 8-0 also 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.930
 in today's session as long as 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.680
 Follow the question for the team 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.360
 Argentinian 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 and the question for the Argentine team 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.490
 would be part of crossing with 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.070
 the second of the group 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.220
 but curiously in this precise 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.200
 They are playing Spain and Brazil 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.479
 that both are classified 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.910
 deciding who will be the first and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.510
 who is going to be the second one expected 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.310
 supposes by the championship history of the 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.440
 roller hockey world that Spain 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.660
 ends first and the second one remains but 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.660
 to everyone's surprise they are tying 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.490
 one to one to say the best moment 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.700
 Brazilian player in the history of 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.070
 roller hockey has achieved via 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.750
 of the penalties of a criminal in treating you 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.030
 the party to the Spaniards who have 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.660
 started to detect art or more after 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.180
 consists this instant is writing down a 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.390
 flat jungle goal 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.030
 and score the second goal for the team 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.280
 Brazil 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.350
 44 so that the first time ends 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.330
 is giving the note to Brazil beating him 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.860
 spain diego good attention with this 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.050
 because it's a difficult crossing if 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.550
 indeed Argentina has to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.290
 cross with spain in rooms I'm not 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.350
 specialist in the field but we know 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.930
 what power 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.210
 totally totally there is also that 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.850
 that is to say Spain has made a change 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.910
 generational from historical players 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.310
 they are not today but always 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.970
 He knows that those who come are also 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.250
 good ones 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.010
 the technical driver Carlos Feriche at 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.710
 this moment did not show television 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.460
 from angola is taking his head almost 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.960
 without understanding what is happening 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.670
 My colleagues just shouted 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.500
 because the truth that a surprise that the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.840
 result of what we are following 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.580
 this world championship here in africa 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.170
 that he is doing for the first time 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.510
 I wanted to tell you that another piece of information 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.000
 illustrative yes for Argentines who 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.650
 we continue in this sport we say that 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.210
 we are making history here in 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.650
 African continent with the first 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.650
 hockey world championship 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.530
 skates because the technician from Brazil is 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.080
 so canine this argentinian is miguel del 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.070
 1 while the selection of italy 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.470
 there are two players also three players 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.990
 that are part of the selection two 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.090
 mendocinos a canino pints that in 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.170
 france we have two sanjuaninos in 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.390
 angola 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.760
 as martÃ­n payero was also 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.130
 nationalized is to say that there are many 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.780
 compatriots cheering this championship 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.430
 of the world diego very well then if not 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.020
 raise the cup one will be another what 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.550
 important that Argentina be of people 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.330
 We are very grateful for the contact and we are going to 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.970
 stay tuned 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.550
 It has been a pleasure to serve you from here 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.370
 from angola then in this case of 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.810
 namibe soon to move them I tell you 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.570
 that the Argentine team travels tomorrow 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.390
 so now another difficulty beyond 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.770
 of the rival in turn that is to adapt to 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.780
 a track on which you have not yet been able 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.060
 skating because this championship has two 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.400
 scenarios is my Ireland that is the 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.420
 angola capital someone in luanda the 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.650
 track has 24 22 x 44 while here 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.320
 where he was doing the stage 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.540
 classifying are 20 by 40 are 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.970
 meters but that make the difference and 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.420
 which is an advantage for those who have already 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.610
 come playing and while argentina 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.200
 will have to quickly adapt I do not think 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.900
 that has possibilities to confuse the 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.240
 track before I'm going to play by rooms 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.770
 very well I did not take long to get another 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.150
 world championship onwards to that 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.950
 with a lot of contacts we demand great 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.510
 hug either against Brazil or against 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.630
 Spain hopefully the team will do very well 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.630
 Argentinian
