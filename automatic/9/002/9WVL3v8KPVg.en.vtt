00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
before I was telling you guys how it was

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.630 
before I was telling you guys how it was
really<00:02:35.600> sluggish<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:37.130> just<00:02:37.340> wanted<00:02:37.520> to

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
really sluggish and I just wanted to

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.930 
really sluggish and I just wanted to
sleep<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.540> had<00:02:38.720> really<00:02:39.170> no<00:02:39.560> motivation<00:02:40.520> to

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
sleep and I had really no motivation to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.870 
sleep and I had really no motivation to
just<00:02:41.150> get<00:02:41.720> up<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.080> do<00:02:42.380> something<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:43.010> you

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
just get up and do something and you

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.310 
just get up and do something and you
guys<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.090> lot<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.480> guys<00:02:44.630> thought<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.960> was<00:02:45.140> low

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
guys a lot of you guys thought I was low

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.120 
guys a lot of you guys thought I was low
in<00:02:45.560> B<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.430> was<00:02:46.580> low<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:47.120> iron<00:02:47.900> which<00:02:48.740> I<00:02:48.980> mean

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
in B and I was low in iron which I mean

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.510 
in B and I was low in iron which I mean
could<00:02:49.520> have<00:02:49.640> probably<00:02:50.270> been<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:51.230> issue<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:52.370> I

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
could have probably been the issue but I

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.820 
could have probably been the issue but I
started<00:02:53.090> drinking<00:02:53.720> these<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.230> these<00:02:54.650> have

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
started drinking these and these have

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.580 
started drinking these and these have
definitely<00:02:55.250> helped<00:02:55.580> me<00:02:55.640> significantly<00:02:56.590> so

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
definitely helped me significantly so

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.400 
definitely helped me significantly so
with<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.980> colon<00:02:58.370> one<00:02:59.020> this<00:03:00.020> one<00:03:00.230> actually

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
with the colon one this one actually

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
with the colon one this one actually
comes<00:03:00.830> in<00:03:01.240> little<00:03:02.240> bags<00:03:02.770> that<00:03:03.770> you<00:03:03.830> can<00:03:04.160> just

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430
