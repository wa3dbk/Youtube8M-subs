other than that I he hasn't been on that
but<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.259> would<00:01:49.350> make<00:01:49.500> sense<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.829> him<00:01:50.009> coming

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
but it would make sense for him coming

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.560 
but it would make sense for him coming
back<00:01:50.369> because<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.299> know<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> whole

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
back because you know the whole

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.740 
back because you know the whole

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
superhero genre is really hype right now

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.569 
superhero genre is really hype right now
it's<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.470> really<00:01:55.530> high<00:01:55.860> from<00:01:56.219> what<00:01:56.399> he

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
it's it's it's really high from what he

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.730 
it's it's it's really high from what he
did<00:01:56.610> back<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.240> back<00:01:57.719> then<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.350> was<00:01:58.530> just

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
did back then back then it was just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.649 
did back then back then it was just
barely<00:01:59.009> stuck<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.490> honestly<00:02:00.000> when<00:02:00.210> he<00:02:00.390> left

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
barely stuck like honestly when he left

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.539 
barely stuck like honestly when he left
that's<00:02:01.229> when<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> train<00:02:01.799> started<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.399> with

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that's when the train started going with

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.889 
that's when the train started going with
the<00:02:02.640> whole<00:02:02.820> moral<00:02:03.090> phase<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.659> everything

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the whole moral phase and everything

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.139 
the whole moral phase and everything
like<00:02:03.990> Marv<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:04.860> Marv<00:02:05.009> was<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.430> mid

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
like Marv I think Marv was like in mid

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.459 
like Marv I think Marv was like in mid
face<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.689> anything<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.110> there<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.409> like

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
face of anything I think there was like

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.930 
face of anything I think there was like
I<00:02:07.649> don't<00:02:07.799> remember<00:02:07.920> I'm<00:02:08.129> not<00:02:08.250> gonna<00:02:08.340> guess<00:02:08.640> but

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
I don't remember I'm not gonna guess but

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.969 
I don't remember I'm not gonna guess but
but<00:02:09.569> how<00:02:09.750> do<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.929> feel<00:02:10.110> about<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.560> Tom<00:02:10.800> one

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
but how do I feel about this if Tom one

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.500 
but how do I feel about this if Tom one
does<00:02:11.250> come<00:02:11.430> back<00:02:11.550> as<00:02:11.700> Superman

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
does come back as Superman

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.740 
does come back as Superman
I<00:02:12.599> could<00:02:12.930> see<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.260> happening<00:02:13.970> but<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.269> still

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
I could see it happening but I still

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.740 
I could see it happening but I still
think<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.670> still<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:17.939> that<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.480> are<00:02:18.629> gonna

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
think I still think that we are gonna

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.479 
think I still think that we are gonna
get<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.930> reference<00:02:19.140> towards<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:19.890> Batman<00:02:20.340> and

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489
