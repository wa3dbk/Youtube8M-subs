00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.660 
c-4 you can throw it across pretty far
but<00:06:26.390> not<00:06:27.390> as<00:06:27.660> far<00:06:28.020> as<00:06:28.170> you<00:06:28.350> would<00:06:28.590> in<00:06:28.860> you<00:06:29.520> know

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
but not as far as you would in you know

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.120 
but not as far as you would in you know
say<00:06:30.060> black<00:06:30.600> ops<00:06:30.870> black<00:06:31.350> ops<00:06:31.560> you<00:06:31.740> can<00:06:31.890> just

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
say black ops black ops you can just

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.060 
say black ops black ops you can just
like<00:06:32.250> threw<00:06:32.550> it<00:06:32.700> across<00:06:32.790> the<00:06:33.000> map<00:06:33.860> but<00:06:34.860> in<00:06:34.980> this

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
like threw it across the map but in this

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.620 
like threw it across the map but in this
game<00:06:35.160> you<00:06:35.340> can't<00:06:35.850> really<00:06:36.000> throw<00:06:36.270> it<00:06:36.450> that<00:06:36.570> far

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
game you can't really throw it that far

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.190 
game you can't really throw it that far
but<00:06:37.380> it<00:06:38.040> is<00:06:38.370> a<00:06:38.640> remote<00:06:38.910> detonator<00:06:39.240> so<00:06:39.810> you<00:06:39.870> can

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
but it is a remote detonator so you can

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.770 
but it is a remote detonator so you can
you<00:06:40.470> know<00:06:40.590> use<00:06:41.040> it<00:06:41.190> whenever<00:06:41.340> you<00:06:41.550> want<00:06:41.820> so

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
you know use it whenever you want so

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.870 
you know use it whenever you want so
