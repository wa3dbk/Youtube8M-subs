00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.990 

this<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.300> my<00:00:03.510> goldfish<00:00:04.259> Isis<00:00:05.930> she<00:00:06.930> has<00:00:07.080> dropsy

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
this is my goldfish Isis she has dropsy

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.330 
this is my goldfish Isis she has dropsy
which<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.360> possibly<00:00:09.900> caused<00:00:10.260> by<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.620> bacterial

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
which is possibly caused by a bacterial

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.120 
which is possibly caused by a bacterial
infection<00:00:11.719> so<00:00:12.719> she<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.110> getting<00:00:13.530> an

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
infection so she is getting an

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.890 
infection so she is getting an
antibiotic<00:00:14.880> injection<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.480> bait<00:00:15.660> ro<00:00:17.750> you<00:00:18.750> can

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
antibiotic injection of bait ro you can

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.870 
antibiotic injection of bait ro you can
tell<00:00:19.080> she<00:00:19.289> has<00:00:19.320> dropsy<00:00:19.890> because<00:00:20.220> her<00:00:20.490> scales

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
tell she has dropsy because her scales

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.800 
tell she has dropsy because her scales
are<00:00:21.180> lifted<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.990> sticking<00:00:22.380> out<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:26.810> this

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
are lifted and sticking out so this

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.410 
are lifted and sticking out so this
injection<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.830> go<00:00:28.980> either<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.269> her

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
injection is going to go either in her

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.790 
injection is going to go either in her
dorsal<00:00:30.869> muscle<00:00:31.550> which<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> muscle<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.570> top

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
dorsal muscle which is the muscle on top

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.119 
dorsal muscle which is the muscle on top
on<00:00:34.800> either<00:00:34.950> side<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.610> dorsal<00:00:36.000> fin<00:00:36.469> or<00:00:37.469> it

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
on either side of the dorsal fin or it

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.030 
on either side of the dorsal fin or it
can<00:00:38.280> go<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.730> me<00:00:38.940> intraperitoneal<00:00:39.770> area<00:00:40.770> which

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
can go in me intraperitoneal area which

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.020 
can go in me intraperitoneal area which
is<00:00:41.270> her<00:00:42.270> belly<00:00:42.480> near<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.110> ventral<00:00:44.010> fins<00:00:47.030> it's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
is her belly near the ventral fins it's

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.360 
is her belly near the ventral fins it's
a<00:00:48.090> very<00:00:48.300> small<00:00:48.930> amount<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> needle<00:00:50.160> is

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
a very small amount and the needle is

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.430 
a very small amount and the needle is
very<00:00:50.399> tiny

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.189 

she<00:00:55.440> shouldn't<00:00:55.739> really<00:00:56.070> feel<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:57.199> but

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
she shouldn't really feel it but

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.179 
she shouldn't really feel it but
normally<00:01:01.070> when<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> pull<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> needle<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
normally when I pull the needle out a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.109 
normally when I pull the needle out a
scale<00:01:05.189> comes<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:07.490> it's<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.670> ideal<00:01:08.909> but

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
scale comes with it it's not ideal but

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.789 
scale comes with it it's not ideal but
it's<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.810> end<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> world<00:01:10.320> because

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it's not the end of the world because

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.750 
it's not the end of the world because
they<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:10.979> grow<00:01:11.310> back<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.799> hold<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
they do grow back so you just hold the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:26.630 
they do grow back so you just hold the
fish<00:01:18.290> firmly<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.680> gently

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.960 

in<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.360> hand<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:29.210> then<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.580> dorsal

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
in one hand and then this is the dorsal

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.460 
in one hand and then this is the dorsal
muscle<00:01:33.330> where<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.630> shots<00:01:33.870> going<00:01:34.230> in<00:01:36.410> try<00:01:37.410> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
muscle where the shots going in try to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.770 
muscle where the shots going in try to
get<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.770> at<00:01:37.890> about<00:01:38.010> a<00:01:38.160> 45-degree<00:01:39.150> angle<00:01:39.180> going

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
get it at about a 45-degree angle going

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.380 
get it at about a 45-degree angle going
in<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.400> doesn't<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.730> in<00:01:41.880> very<00:01:42.030> far<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
in and it doesn't go in very far but you

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.980 
in and it doesn't go in very far but you
do<00:01:45.510> have<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.780> press<00:01:46.050> for<00:01:46.350> em<00:01:50.300> okay<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:51.630> then

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
do have to press for em okay and then

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.200 
do have to press for em okay and then
you<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.320> inject

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.460 

and<00:01:57.720> then<00:01:57.840> pull<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.200> needle<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:58.590> and<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:01.290> can

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
and then pull the needle out and you can

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.760 
and then pull the needle out and you can
see<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:02.010> scale<00:02:02.370> on<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.910> needle<00:02:03.240> there<00:02:03.770> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
see the scale on the needle there that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.770 
see the scale on the needle there that
came<00:02:05.010> off<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:11.030> just<00:02:12.030> swimming<00:02:12.300> around<00:02:12.450> again

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
came off and just swimming around again

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.820 
came off and just swimming around again
like<00:02:12.960> nothing<00:02:12.990> even<00:02:13.410> happened<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:16.620> went

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
like nothing even happened that went

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.760 
like nothing even happened that went
really<00:02:17.040> well

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
really well

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.550 
really well
good<00:02:19.770> job<00:02:20.070> who's<00:02:20.340> this
