00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.240 
noon is quieter than my clean tone this
is<00:01:31.600> one<00:01:31.750> of<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.900> things<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.470> was<00:01:32.620> lacking<00:01:32.950> in

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
is one of the things that was lacking in

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.560 
is one of the things that was lacking in
the<00:01:33.370> original<00:01:33.700> blues<00:01:33.850> breaker<00:01:34.090> didn't<00:01:34.390> really

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
the original blues breaker didn't really

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.470 
the original blues breaker didn't really
have<00:01:34.690> enough<00:01:34.720> volume<00:01:35.290> or<00:01:35.470> Headroom<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.040> so<00:01:36.790> if

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
have enough volume or Headroom and so if

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.240 
have enough volume or Headroom and so if
you<00:01:37.660> didn't<00:01:37.990> have<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.500> volume<00:01:38.800> cranked<00:01:39.130> all

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
you didn't have the volume cranked all

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.020 
you didn't have the volume cranked all
the<00:01:39.280> way<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:40.450> really<00:01:40.780> was<00:01:41.260> a<00:01:41.290> weak<00:01:41.620> pedal<00:01:42.070> so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
the way it really was a weak pedal so

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.850 
the way it really was a weak pedal so
now<00:01:43.210> I'm<00:01:43.360> just<00:01:43.540> gonna<00:01:43.720> have<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.380> cranked<00:01:44.710> all

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
now I'm just gonna have it cranked all

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.720 
now I'm just gonna have it cranked all
the<00:01:44.920> way<00:01:45.100> I'll<00:01:45.490> let<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:45.790> listen<00:01:45.940> again

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:02:04.250 

you

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:32.730 

you

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.590 

so<00:02:33.740> as<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.220> can<00:02:34.310> tell<00:02:34.520> even<00:02:35.180> with<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.330> volume

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
so as you can tell even with the volume

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.120 
so as you can tell even with the volume
cranked<00:02:35.870> all<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.050> way<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.620> gain<00:02:36.800> still

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
cranked all the way and the gain still

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.580 
cranked all the way and the gain still
at<00:02:37.340> noon<00:02:37.580> we<00:02:38.090> really<00:02:38.450> don't<00:02:38.600> have<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:39.170> whole<00:02:39.560> lot

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
at noon we really don't have a whole lot

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.880 
at noon we really don't have a whole lot
of<00:02:39.800> gain<00:02:40.190> or<00:02:40.460> even<00:02:41.360> volume<00:02:41.750> push<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.710> amp

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
of gain or even volume push to the amp

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.490 
of gain or even volume push to the amp
and<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:44.780> one<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.080> things<00:02:45.290> that

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
and so this is one of the things that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.260 
and so this is one of the things that
the<00:02:45.590> keys<00:02:45.800> Minh<00:02:46.010> earlybird<00:02:46.310> really<00:02:46.730> addresses

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
the keys Minh earlybird really addresses

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.630 
the keys Minh earlybird really addresses

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.180

they<00:02:50.360> really<00:02:50.960> increase<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.380> volume<00:02:51.560> as<00:02:51.770> well

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
they really increase the volume as well

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.980 
they really increase the volume as well
you'll<00:02:52.400> see<00:02:52.580> they<00:02:52.730> increase<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.210> gain<00:02:53.390> the

you'll see they increase the gain the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.180 
you'll see they increase the gain the

exactly the same but you can hear that
the<00:03:29.120> earlybird<00:03:29.990> one<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.500> great<00:03:30.650> things

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
the earlybird one of the great things

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.380 
the earlybird one of the great things
about<00:03:30.980> having<00:03:31.130> more<00:03:31.490> volume<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.120> can<00:03:32.240> have

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
about having more volume is you can have

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.420 
about having more volume is you can have
the<00:03:32.480> gain<00:03:32.690> knob<00:03:32.870> lower<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.620> here's<00:03:34.160> some<00:03:34.340> of

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
the gain knob lower and here's some of

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.390 
the gain knob lower and here's some of
that<00:03:34.460> fine<00:03:34.850> grit<00:03:35.210> and<00:03:35.390> have<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:36.020> volume

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
that fine grit and have that volume

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.370 
that fine grit and have that volume
increasing<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.850> level<00:03:38.209> with<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.810> gain<00:03:39.110> set

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
increasing the level with the gain set

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.290 
increasing the level with the gain set
minimal<00:03:39.770> and<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.100> can<00:03:40.250> get<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.580> nice<00:03:40.820> lighter

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
minimal and you can get a nice lighter

00:03:41.300 --> 00:04:06.090 
minimal and you can get a nice lighter
overdrive<00:03:41.870> sound<00:03:42.080> so<00:03:42.320> here's<00:03:42.470> clean

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:29.780 

now<00:04:07.100> here's<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.640> original

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.860 

and<00:04:30.240> now<00:04:30.990> we<00:04:31.290> will<00:04:31.500> increase<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.370> gain<00:04:32.870> will

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
and now we will increase the gain will

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.150 
and now we will increase the gain will
back<00:04:34.020> off<00:04:34.200> on<00:04:34.230> the<00:04:34.410> volume<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:35.010> is<00:04:35.070> the

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
back off on the volume this is the

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.680 
back off on the volume this is the
volume<00:04:35.250> knob<00:04:35.730> on<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:35.910> keys<00:04:36.150> been<00:04:36.300> early<00:04:36.540> bird

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
volume knob on the keys been early bird

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.780 
volume knob on the keys been early bird
this<00:04:37.080> is<00:04:37.230> tone<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.680> this<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.400> gain<00:04:38.580> right

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
this is tone and this is the gain right

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.900 
this is tone and this is the gain right
here<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:39.300> we<00:04:39.450> will<00:04:39.710> back<00:04:40.710> off<00:04:40.950> on<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.340> volume

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
here so we will back off on the volume

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.470 
here so we will back off on the volume
and<00:04:42.150> we<00:04:42.480> will<00:04:42.630> increase<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.140> game<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:44.480> then

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
and we will increase the game and then

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.140 
and we will increase the game and then
we<00:04:45.660> will<00:04:45.870> try<00:04:46.140> and<00:04:46.290> get<00:04:46.410> a<00:04:46.440> similar<00:04:46.860> sound<00:04:47.310> out

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
we will try and get a similar sound out

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.800 
we will try and get a similar sound out
of<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:50.430> original<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.060> basically<00:04:51.540> what<00:04:51.660> we're

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
of the original and basically what we're

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.850 
of the original and basically what we're
doing<00:04:51.840> is<00:04:52.080> we're<00:04:52.290> trying<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.560> show<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:52.770> a

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
doing is we're trying to show you a

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.720 
doing is we're trying to show you a
higher<00:04:53.190> gain<00:04:53.460> setting<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:58.730> probably

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
higher gain setting and probably

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.060 
higher gain setting and probably
somewhere<00:05:00.360> about<00:05:00.570> there<00:05:00.810> but<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:01.710> can<00:05:01.890> still

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
somewhere about there but you can still

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.670 
somewhere about there but you can still
see<00:05:02.310> there's<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:02.580> ton<00:05:02.910> of<00:05:02.970> volume<00:05:03.540> of<00:05:03.990> room<00:05:04.200> left

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
see there's a ton of volume of room left

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.320 
see there's a ton of volume of room left
on<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:06.000> original<00:05:06.540> and<00:05:07.380> there's<00:05:08.010> also<00:05:08.250> half<00:05:09.030> of

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
on the original and there's also half of

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.810 
on the original and there's also half of
the<00:05:09.660> volume<00:05:09.990> still<00:05:10.260> left<00:05:10.500> on<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:11.520> early<00:05:11.790> bird

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
the volume still left on the early bird

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.910 
the volume still left on the early bird
and<00:05:12.120> there's<00:05:12.540> still<00:05:12.720> some<00:05:12.960> gain<00:05:13.170> available<00:05:13.740> on

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
and there's still some gain available on

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.380 
and there's still some gain available on
the<00:05:14.040> early<00:05:14.280> bird<00:05:14.310> you<00:05:14.580> can<00:05:14.820> crank<00:05:15.030> it<00:05:15.150> further

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
the early bird you can crank it further

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.420 
the early bird you can crank it further
and<00:05:15.570> get<00:05:15.750> more<00:05:15.990> over<00:05:16.200> driven<00:05:16.860> tones<00:05:17.070> but<00:05:17.310> the

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
and get more over driven tones but the

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.860 
and get more over driven tones but the
gain<00:05:17.640> is<00:05:17.820> maxed<00:05:18.210> out<00:05:18.360> on<00:05:18.480> the<00:05:18.570> original

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
gain is maxed out on the original

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.400 
gain is maxed out on the original

so<00:05:19.590> here<00:05:20.580> we<00:05:20.700> go

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.990 

and<00:06:11.870> right<00:06:12.620> now<00:06:12.770> I'm<00:06:12.889> just<00:06:12.979> gonna<00:06:13.190> max<00:06:13.729> the

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
and right now I'm just gonna max the

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.760 
and right now I'm just gonna max the
gain<00:06:14.210> on<00:06:14.419> the<00:06:14.510> early<00:06:14.960> bird<00:06:14.990> bring<00:06:15.440> back<00:06:15.590> the

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
gain on the early bird bring back the

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.379 
gain on the early bird bring back the
volume<00:06:15.889> a<00:06:16.100> little<00:06:16.130> bit<00:06:16.340> and<00:06:16.760> just<00:06:17.090> show<00:06:17.330> you

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
volume a little bit and just show you

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.810 
volume a little bit and just show you
some<00:06:17.810> more<00:06:17.960> of<00:06:18.229> the<00:06:18.620> gain<00:06:18.919> range<00:06:19.550> that's

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
some more of the gain range that's

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:49.360 
some more of the gain range that's
available<00:06:20.240> in<00:06:20.389> the<00:06:20.510> early<00:06:20.630> bird

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.570 

and<00:06:49.870> once<00:06:50.870> again<00:06:51.050> compared<00:06:51.650> to<00:06:51.710> the<00:06:52.040> max<00:06:52.280> gain

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
and once again compared to the max gain

00:06:52.580 --> 00:07:40.210 
and once again compared to the max gain
available<00:06:53.120> in<00:06:53.270> the<00:06:53.360> original

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:40.220 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.070 

so<00:07:41.220> there<00:07:41.550> you<00:07:41.670> have<00:07:41.700> it<00:07:41.820> folks<00:07:42.060> the<00:07:42.510> keys<00:07:42.840> Minh

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 
so there you have it folks the keys Minh

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.050 
so there you have it folks the keys Minh
