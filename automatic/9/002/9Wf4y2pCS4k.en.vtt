00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.619

 here in the little corner he has his pen as 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:42.060
 thumb is an excellent phone so 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.570
 this is the factory as we can see 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.320

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.290
 I put has what is your 8 camera 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.930

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.790
 autofocus 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.570

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.449
 third view camera 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.890

 not a single one fails 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.970
 as you can see it's pretty fast it's 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.700
 quite fluid the phone does not have 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:20.500
 no failure is quite fast the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.560
 true 5.5-inch screens 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.650
 long let's see what is the adjustments 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.330

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.560

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.780
 factory so that they will not have or 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:01.260
 a single problem with the network 3g the water 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.860
