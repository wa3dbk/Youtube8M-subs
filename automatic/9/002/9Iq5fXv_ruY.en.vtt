00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.270 
spread out their universe is a lot
better<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.570> lot<00:03:22.750> cooler<00:03:23.380> than<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.770> DC

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
better and a lot cooler than that DC

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.810 
better and a lot cooler than that DC
does<00:03:24.780> which<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:25.810> kind<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.110> cool<00:03:26.820> anyways

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
DC it's kind of just more or less just

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.240 
DC it's kind of just more or less just
personal<00:03:31.630> preference<00:03:31.900> but<00:03:32.200> like<00:03:33.100> I<00:03:33.190> said

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
personal preference but like I said

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.890 
personal preference but like I said
never<00:03:33.580> been<00:03:33.760> much<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.060> huge<00:03:34.239> fan<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.480> Batman

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
or Superman so there's the entire piece

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.790 
or Superman so there's the entire piece
I<00:03:37.720> have<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.900> cut<00:03:38.050> this<00:03:38.170> out<00:03:38.320> into<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.590> whole

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
I have to cut this out into a whole

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.900 
I have to cut this out into a whole
bunch<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.040> different<00:03:39.340> pieces<00:03:39.489> because

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
bunch of different pieces because

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.130 
bunch of different pieces because
there's<00:03:40.060> no<00:03:40.270> way<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:40.600> is<00:03:40.660> going<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.020> be

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
there's no way this is going to be

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.910 
there's no way this is going to be
transferred<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.690> site<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.050> part<00:03:44.830> of

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
transferred to the site to the part of

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.680 
transferred to the site to the part of
the<00:03:45.010> paper<00:03:45.640> there<00:03:45.970> without<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.420> kind<00:03:46.660> of

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
the paper there without it kind of

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.820 
the paper there without it kind of
coming<00:03:46.959> apart<00:03:47.230> into<00:03:47.350> a<00:03:47.440> million<00:03:47.739> different

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
coming apart into a million different

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.590 
coming apart into a million different
pieces<00:03:48.190> by<00:03:48.489> accident<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.150> kind<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.390> have<00:03:49.510> to

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
pieces by accident so I kind of have to

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.320 
pieces by accident so I kind of have to
cut<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.870> out<00:03:50.100> into<00:03:51.100> different<00:03:51.220> pieces<00:03:51.700> apply

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
cut it out into different pieces apply

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.100 
cut it out into different pieces apply
it<00:03:52.390> all<00:03:52.720> separately<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.700> there<00:03:54.850> we<00:03:54.970> go<00:03:55.110> I'm

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
it all separately so there we go I'm

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.330 
it all separately so there we go I'm
going<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.320> line<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.650> up<00:03:56.770> towards<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.130> bottom

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
going to line that up towards the bottom

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.610 
going to line that up towards the bottom
a<00:03:57.640> few<00:03:58.120> little<00:03:58.150> sticky<00:03:58.750> strings<00:03:59.110> there<00:03:59.350> I<00:03:59.380> can

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
a few little sticky strings there I can

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.060 
a few little sticky strings there I can
trim<00:03:59.860> off<00:04:00.010> with<00:04:00.250> my<00:04:00.459> hobby<00:04:00.970> knife<00:04:01.209> eventually

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
trim off with my hobby knife eventually

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.370 
trim off with my hobby knife eventually
and<00:04:03.070> we<00:04:03.280> see<00:04:03.459> that<00:04:03.489> piece<00:04:03.850> there<00:04:04.200> I'm<00:04:05.200> going<00:04:05.320> to

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
and we see that piece there I'm going to

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.220 
and we see that piece there I'm going to
work<00:04:05.530> on<00:04:05.770> part<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.130> his<00:04:06.280> grapple<00:04:06.790> here<00:04:07.300> it's

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
work on part of his grapple here it's

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.570 
work on part of his grapple here it's
kind<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:08.560> little<00:04:08.800> hard<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.070> tell<00:04:09.250> with<00:04:09.430> the

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
kind of a little hard to tell with the

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.190 
kind of a little hard to tell with the
other<00:04:09.760> silhouette<00:04:10.239> but<00:04:10.390> that's<00:04:10.570> exactly<00:04:10.750> what

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
other silhouette but that's exactly what

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.070 
other silhouette but that's exactly what
it<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.350> on<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.950> on<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.519> other<00:04:13.330> picture<00:04:13.660> and

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
it is on the on the other picture and

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.810 
it is on the on the other picture and
this<00:04:14.830> one's<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.070> little<00:04:15.160> tricky<00:04:15.519> because<00:04:15.580> it's

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
this one's a little tricky because it's

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.729 
this one's a little tricky because it's
got<00:04:15.910> a<00:04:15.970> whole<00:04:16.239> bunch<00:04:16.450> of<00:04:16.600> little<00:04:16.840> pieces<00:04:17.230> that

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
got a whole bunch of little pieces that

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.289 
got a whole bunch of little pieces that
can<00:04:17.890> kind<00:04:18.190> of<00:04:18.280> like<00:04:18.430> get<00:04:18.580> stuck<00:04:18.850> together<00:04:19.030> and

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
can kind of like get stuck together and

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.170 
can kind of like get stuck together and
then<00:04:19.690> kind<00:04:19.900> of<00:04:20.020> rip<00:04:20.200> off<00:04:20.410> so<00:04:20.880> could<00:04:21.880> figure<00:04:22.090> out

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
then kind of rip off so could figure out

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.670 
then kind of rip off so could figure out
exactly<00:04:22.690> how<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:22.930> stick<00:04:23.200> it<00:04:23.320> so<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.410> just<00:04:23.440> stuck

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
exactly how to stick it so I just stuck

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.500 
exactly how to stick it so I just stuck
it<00:04:23.740> there<00:04:23.950> for<00:04:23.979> a<00:04:24.160> few<00:04:24.669> seconds<00:04:25.030> I'm

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
it there for a few seconds I'm

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.080 
it there for a few seconds I'm
go<00:04:25.960> back<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:26.140> fix<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:27.310> know<00:04:27.400> find<00:04:28.000> out

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
go back and fix that you know find out

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.460 
go back and fix that you know find out
exactly<00:04:28.480> where<00:04:28.720> it's<00:04:28.840> supposed<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.140> be<00:04:29.200> stuck

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
exactly where it's supposed to be stuck

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.280 
exactly where it's supposed to be stuck
down<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:31.060> sick<00:04:31.300> in<00:04:31.420> those<00:04:31.570> three<00:04:31.930> on<00:04:32.080> there

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
down so sick in those three on there

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.410 
down so sick in those three on there
right<00:04:32.650> there<00:04:33.040> and<00:04:33.310> I'm<00:04:33.730> going<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.060> rearrange

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
right there and I'm going to rearrange

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.910 
right there and I'm going to rearrange
that<00:04:34.840> piece<00:04:36.600> looks<00:04:37.600> great<00:04:38.140> so<00:04:38.620> there<00:04:38.710> will<00:04:38.890> be

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
that piece looks great so there will be

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.190 
that piece looks great so there will be

and sticking it right onto the yellow
piece<00:05:32.740> there<00:05:34.560> all<00:05:35.560> right<00:05:36.100> i'm<00:05:36.760> pretty<00:05:37.030> sure<00:05:37.120> in

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
piece there all right i'm pretty sure in

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.550

the<00:05:37.270> Michael<00:05:37.450> Keaton<00:05:37.900> movies<00:05:38.110> they<00:05:38.230> actually

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
the Michael Keaton movies they actually

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.430 
the Michael Keaton movies they actually
use<00:05:38.770> a<00:05:38.800> different<00:05:39.370> bat<00:05:39.900> logo<00:05:40.900> for<00:05:41.230> the<00:05:41.260> bat

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
use a different bat logo for the bat

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.260 
use a different bat logo for the bat
signal<00:05:41.650> to<00:05:42.010> I<00:05:42.040> think<00:05:42.310> was<00:05:42.430> more<00:05:42.700> of<00:05:42.790> a<00:05:42.910> circular

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
signal to I think was more of a circular

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.480 
signal to I think was more of a circular
shape<00:05:43.510> instead<00:05:44.200> of<00:05:44.350> an<00:05:44.440> oval<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:44.980> think<00:05:45.400> this

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
shape instead of an oval I think this

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.950 
shape instead of an oval I think this
one<00:05:45.700> was<00:05:45.790> the<00:05:45.910> one<00:05:46.060> that<00:05:46.210> he<00:05:46.270> wore<00:05:46.540> like<00:05:46.720> on<00:05:46.840> his

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
one was the one that he wore like on his

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.370 
one was the one that he wore like on his
actual<00:05:47.350> costume<00:05:48.720> so<00:05:49.720> there's<00:05:49.870> the<00:05:49.990> first<00:05:50.110> one

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
actual costume so there's the first one

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.660 
actual costume so there's the first one
this<00:05:50.530> is<00:05:50.590> loco<00:05:50.950> of<00:05:51.010> course<00:05:51.220> the<00:05:51.400> new
