00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
that's just Griffin Anse inside the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.160 
that's just Griffin Anse inside the
metal<00:02:02.790> there<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.420> slide<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.840> out<00:02:03.899> that

okay<00:02:11.110> what<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.140> knew<00:02:12.349> was<00:02:12.500> convinced<00:02:13.060> drop<00:02:14.060> it

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
okay what I knew was convinced drop it

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.589 
okay what I knew was convinced drop it
from<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.480> top<00:02:16.030> but<00:02:17.030> when<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.209> drop<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.450> in

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.289 
from the top but when you drop it in
from<00:02:17.629> the<00:02:17.840> top<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:19.610> need<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.819> make<00:02:19.909> sure<00:02:19.940> that

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
from the top you need to make sure that

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.649 
from the top you need to make sure that
this<00:02:20.860> slides<00:02:21.860> onto<00:02:22.129> their<00:02:22.489> catch<00:02:23.390> for<00:02:23.599> the

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
this slides onto their catch for the

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.240 
this slides onto their catch for the
bonnet<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.440> wise<00:02:24.590> you'll<00:02:24.739> end<00:02:24.920> up<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.129> the

bonnet the wise you'll end up to the
fight<00:02:25.700> against<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.629> you<00:02:26.720> just<00:02:26.750> drop<00:02:27.019> it<00:02:28.660> you

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
fight against it so you just drop it you

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
want to pop it this in so it should just

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.610 
want to pop it this in so it should just
sit<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.400> nicely<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.989> then<00:02:45.140> once<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.379> happy

with this setting nicely this one's
hanging<00:02:48.049> down<00:02:48.290> slow<00:02:49.420> one<00:02:50.420> shuffle<00:02:50.720> is<00:02:50.780> seen<00:02:50.959> it

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049

look<00:03:26.700> at<00:03:26.850> this<00:03:27.000> chain<00:03:27.390> there<00:03:27.920> sometime

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
look at this chain there sometime

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:44.120 
look at this chain there sometime
otherwise<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.180> look<00:03:30.710> like<00:03:42.650> I'm<00:03:43.650> just<00:03:43.830> tying<00:03:43.980> it
