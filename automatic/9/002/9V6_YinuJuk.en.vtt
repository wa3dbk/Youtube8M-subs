00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and i think unique to Nottingham i don't

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.630 
and i think unique to Nottingham i don't
think<00:01:48.990> there's<00:01:49.140> another<00:01:49.350> uni<00:01:49.800> that<00:01:50.280> offers

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
think there's another uni that offers

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.639 
think there's another uni that offers
you<00:01:50.789> a<00:01:50.819> chance<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.539> six<00:01:51.869> months<00:01:52.259> doing<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
you a chance to do six months doing the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.249 
you a chance to do six months doing the
exact<00:01:53.009> same<00:01:53.039> modules<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.030> another<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.140> another

it's a university that has great

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.520 
it's a university that has great
expectations<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.940> its<00:02:14.060> graduates<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.989> doesn't
