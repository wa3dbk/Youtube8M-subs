well<00:00:20.410> we're<00:00:20.560> going<00:00:20.650> to<00:00:20.710> be<00:00:20.830> doing<00:00:21.130> in<00:00:21.220> size<00:00:21.460> in

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
well we're going to be doing in size in

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.730 
well we're going to be doing in size in
that<00:00:21.700> a<00:00:21.850> number<00:00:22.180> of<00:00:22.420> things<00:00:22.660> my<00:00:22.930> connection<00:00:23.560> is

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
that a number of things my connection is

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.940 
that a number of things my connection is
really<00:00:24.520> dancer<00:00:25.090> a<00:00:25.120> simple<00:00:25.600> question<00:00:26.050> where

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
really dancer a simple question where

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.790 
really dancer a simple question where
does<00:00:27.220> all<00:00:27.340> the<00:00:27.520> sunlight<00:00:27.760> go<00:00:28.180> or<00:00:29.140> more

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
does all the sunlight go or more

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.280 
does all the sunlight go or more
scientifically<00:00:30.550> how<00:00:31.180> a<00:00:31.210> solar<00:00:31.600> radiation

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
scientifically how a solar radiation

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.830 
scientifically how a solar radiation
partitioned<00:00:32.950> among<00:00:33.070> reflection<00:00:34.030> absorption

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
partitioned among reflection absorption

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.450 
partitioned among reflection absorption
and<00:00:35.050> the<00:00:35.320> ice<00:00:35.440> and<00:00:35.710> transmission<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.430> the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
and the ice and transmission to the

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.330 
and the ice and transmission to the
ocean<00:00:36.880> and<00:00:37.780> so<00:00:38.020> what<00:00:38.200> we<00:00:38.320> doing<00:00:38.890> out<00:00:39.010> here<00:00:39.040> is

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
ocean and so what we doing out here is

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.040 
ocean and so what we doing out here is
we're<00:00:39.520> making<00:00:39.640> measurements<00:00:40.330> we're<00:00:40.840> trying

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
we're making measurements we're trying

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.990 
we're making measurements we're trying
to<00:00:41.170> look<00:00:41.320> at<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.559> spatial<00:00:41.860> variability<00:00:42.340> of

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
to look at the spatial variability of

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.840 
to look at the spatial variability of
how<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.720> Sun<00:00:44.350> lights<00:00:44.559> reflected<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.430> then

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
how the Sun lights reflected and then

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.410 
how the Sun lights reflected and then
also<00:00:46.140> looking<00:00:47.140> at<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.410> temporal<00:00:47.830> evolution

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
also looking at the temporal evolution

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.700 
also looking at the temporal evolution
and<00:00:49.420> we'll<00:00:49.600> take<00:00:49.809> all<00:00:49.989> this<00:00:50.170> data<00:00:50.410> together

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
and we'll take all this data together

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.619 
and we'll take all this data together
and<00:00:51.220> then<00:00:51.430> tie<00:00:51.640> them<00:00:51.910> with<00:00:51.970> something<00:00:52.300> called

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
and then tie them with something called

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.930 
and then tie them with something called
the<00:00:52.809> mass<00:00:53.080> balance<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.589> the<00:00:53.650> ice<00:00:53.710> cover<00:00:54.160> and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
the mass balance of the ice cover and

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.820 
the mass balance of the ice cover and
the<00:00:55.030> mass<00:00:55.210> balance<00:00:55.660> is<00:00:55.780> really<00:00:56.140> a<00:00:56.170> simple<00:00:56.650> but

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
the mass balance is really a simple but

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.130 
the mass balance is really a simple but
important<00:00:57.339> concept<00:00:57.850> we<00:00:58.449> know<00:00:58.629> that<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.930> sea

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
important concept we know that the sea

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.290 
important concept we know that the sea
ice<00:00:59.260> cover<00:00:59.589> is<00:00:59.800> thinning<00:01:00.250> but<00:01:00.879> we<00:01:00.970> don't<00:01:01.150> know

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
ice cover is thinning but we don't know

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.210 
ice cover is thinning but we don't know
how<00:01:01.570> it's<00:01:01.839> there<00:01:02.080> we<00:01:02.620> don't<00:01:02.769> know<00:01:02.980> if<00:01:03.100> it's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
how it's there we don't know if it's

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.680 
how it's there we don't know if it's
thinning<00:01:03.460> because<00:01:03.670> it's<00:01:03.970> not<00:01:04.180> growing<00:01:04.449> as

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
thinning because it's not growing as

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.480 
thinning because it's not growing as
much<00:01:04.839> in<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.110> winter<00:01:05.260> or<00:01:05.950> because<00:01:06.280> it's

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
much in the winter or because it's

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.100 
much in the winter or because it's
melting<00:01:06.880> more<00:01:07.090> on<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.300> surface<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:07.900> summer

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
melting more on the surface and summer

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.350 
melting more on the surface and summer
or<00:01:08.590> maybe<00:01:08.770> melting<00:01:09.280> more<00:01:09.400> on<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.640> bottom<00:01:10.060> or

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
or maybe melting more on the bottom or

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.060 
or maybe melting more on the bottom or
perhaps<00:01:10.600> some<00:01:10.960> combination<00:01:11.560> of<00:01:11.680> all<00:01:11.830> those

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
perhaps some combination of all those

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.090 
perhaps some combination of all those
the<00:01:12.880> mass<00:01:13.120> balance<00:01:13.540> can<00:01:13.720> answer<00:01:13.990> how<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.800> ice

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
the mass balance can answer how the ice

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.120 
the mass balance can answer how the ice
is<00:01:15.340> thinning<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:16.270> can<00:01:16.479> with<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.530> these<00:01:17.860> mass

is thinning it can with the these mass
balance<00:01:18.550> measurements<00:01:19.000> we<00:01:19.150> track<00:01:19.420> how<00:01:19.720> much

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
balance measurements we track how much

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.780 
balance measurements we track how much
growth<00:01:20.170> there<00:01:20.380> is<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:20.740> how<00:01:21.190> much<00:01:21.340> melting

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790

and one of the primary drivers of that
surface<00:01:26.350> melting<00:01:27.009> is<00:01:27.310> sunlight<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.119> so<00:01:28.689> to

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
surface melting is sunlight and so to

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.719 
surface melting is sunlight and so to
tie<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:29.350> all<00:01:29.560> together<00:01:29.710> what<00:01:30.280> we're<00:01:30.430> doing

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
tie it all together what we're doing

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.090 
tie it all together what we're doing
here<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.390> we're<00:01:31.689> trying<00:01:31.899> to<00:01:32.020> understand<00:01:32.590> the

called first-year sea ice and there's
more<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.810> more<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.140> as<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.560> ice<00:02:08.590> cover

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
more and more of that as the ice cover

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.620 
more and more of that as the ice cover
retreats<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.820> you<00:02:10.179> get<00:02:10.330> some<00:02:10.509> very

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
retreats and you get some very

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.900 
retreats and you get some very
interesting<00:02:10.780> things<00:02:11.530> as<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.370> can<00:02:12.520> kind<00:02:12.790> of

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
interesting things as you can kind of

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.570 
interesting things as you can kind of
see<00:02:13.140> one<00:02:14.140> day<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.530> ice<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.950> flooded<00:02:15.430> with

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
see one day the ice is flooded with

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.630 
see one day the ice is flooded with
water<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.240> next<00:02:16.510> day<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.780> strains

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.000 

and<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.700> think<00:02:20.910> one<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.330> things<00:02:21.569> that

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
and I think one of the things that

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.610 
and I think one of the things that
drives<00:02:23.010> my<00:02:23.310> work<00:02:23.610> now<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.930> ISO<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:25.470> though

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
drives my work now is the ISO be though

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.949 
drives my work now is the ISO be though
feedback<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.700> that's<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.510> mechanism

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
feedback and that's just a mechanism

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.190 
feedback and that's just a mechanism
where<00:02:28.290> when<00:02:28.890> sunlight<00:02:29.310> comes<00:02:29.580> in<00:02:29.989> here<00:02:30.989> in<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
where when sunlight comes in here in the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.650 
where when sunlight comes in here in the
spring<00:02:31.560> when<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.099> covered<00:02:32.940> by<00:02:33.090> snow<00:02:33.150> most

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
spring when this is covered by snow most

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.690 
spring when this is covered by snow most
of<00:02:33.840> its<00:02:34.019> reflective<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:35.040> some<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.549> gets

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
of its reflective but some of it gets

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.910 
of its reflective but some of it gets
absorbed<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.870> melts<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.379> snow<00:02:37.440> which

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
absorbed and that melts the snow which

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.770 
absorbed and that melts the snow which
starts<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.400> melt<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.700> surface<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.510> it

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
starts to melt the surface and it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.630 
starts to melt the surface and it
darkens<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.290> surface<00:02:40.769> lowering<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.340> albedo

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
darkens the surface lowering the albedo

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.610 
darkens the surface lowering the albedo
so<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.090> get<00:02:42.209> more<00:02:42.420> sunlight<00:02:42.720> absorbed<00:02:43.470> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
so you get more sunlight absorbed and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.650 
so you get more sunlight absorbed and
that<00:02:44.069> lowers<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> albedo<00:02:44.760> even<00:02:45.150> more<00:02:45.390> and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
that lowers the albedo even more and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.210 
that lowers the albedo even more and
this<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.840> what's<00:02:46.410> called<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.739> positive

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
this is what's called a positive

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.400 
this is what's called a positive
feedback<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:48.269> these<00:02:48.420> positive<00:02:48.959> feedbacks

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
feedback and these positive feedbacks

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.960 
feedback and these positive feedbacks
are<00:02:49.620> really<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.980> interest<00:02:50.130> for<00:02:50.549> climate

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
are really of interest for climate

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.000 
are really of interest for climate

sunlight<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.340> keeps<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.730> earth<00:04:02.760> warm

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
sunlight that keeps the earth warm

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.510 
sunlight that keeps the earth warm
ultimately<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:04.590> how<00:04:05.070> much<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.280> that

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
ultimately and so how much of that

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.910 
ultimately and so how much of that
sunlight<00:04:05.790> comes<00:04:06.210> in<00:04:06.360> is<00:04:06.540> important<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.260> also

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
sunlight comes in is important and also

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.980 
sunlight comes in is important and also
how<00:04:08.370> much<00:04:08.550> of<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.820> sunlight<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.330> reflected<00:04:09.870> by

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
how much of the sunlight is reflected by

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.870 
how much of the sunlight is reflected by
the<00:04:10.050> surface<00:04:10.320> it's<00:04:10.740> important<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.760> what

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
the surface it's important and what

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.820 
the surface it's important and what
we're<00:04:12.000> going<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.150> do<00:04:12.360> now<00:04:12.570> is<00:04:12.900> go<00:04:13.380> off<00:04:13.560> and

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
we're going to do now is go off and

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.380 
we're going to do now is go off and
measure<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.070> quantity<00:04:14.640> called<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:14.970> albedo

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
measure a quantity called the albedo

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.020 
measure a quantity called the albedo
which<00:04:16.140> is<00:04:16.320> just<00:04:16.530> simply<00:04:16.860> a<00:04:17.220> fraction<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:17.970> the

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
which is just simply a fraction of the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.000 
which is just simply a fraction of the
incident<00:04:18.450> sunlight<00:04:18.870> that's<00:04:19.290> reflected<00:04:19.860> by<00:04:19.890> a

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010

we've got to boot up the system and do

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.650 
we've got to boot up the system and do
some<00:04:40.830> optimization<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:41.910> calibration<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.600> the

kind<00:04:50.700> of<00:04:50.790> pleasant<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.270> stand<00:04:51.540> around<00:04:51.810> while

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
kind of pleasant to stand around while

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.100 
kind of pleasant to stand around while
the<00:04:52.650> instruments<00:04:53.130> calibrating<00:04:53.730> itself<00:04:54.110> well

I've<00:04:55.230> been<00:04:55.350> out<00:04:55.500> here<00:04:55.800> in<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.040> cold<00:04:56.250> when<00:04:56.640> it's

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
I've been out here in the cold when it's

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.910 
I've been out here in the cold when it's
really<00:04:57.570> gotten<00:04:57.840> old<00:04:58.020> waiting<00:04:58.290> on<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.590> machine

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
really gotten old waiting on the machine

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.890 
really gotten old waiting on the machine
you<00:04:59.490> have<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.730> instrument<00:05:00.210> all<00:05:00.330> ready<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:00.750> go

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
you have the instrument all ready to go

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.640 
you have the instrument all ready to go
it's<00:05:01.470> time<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.890> measure<00:05:02.070> in<00:05:02.220> albedo<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:03.650> again

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
it's time to measure in albedo and again

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.870 
it's time to measure in albedo and again
that's<00:05:04.830> going<00:05:04.950> to<00:05:05.010> be<00:05:05.070> a<00:05:05.130> simple<00:05:05.430> instrument

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
that's going to be a simple instrument

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.180 
that's going to be a simple instrument
we're<00:05:06.270> going<00:05:06.390> to<00:05:06.450> point<00:05:06.660> this<00:05:06.870> up<00:05:07.110> rotate<00:05:08.010> them

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
we're going to point this up rotate them

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.370 
we're going to point this up rotate them
point<00:05:08.460> it<00:05:08.580> down<00:05:08.790> but<00:05:09.480> there<00:05:09.630> are<00:05:09.750> a<00:05:09.810> few<00:05:10.080> things

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
point it down but there are a few things

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.650 
point it down but there are a few things
you<00:05:10.530> really<00:05:10.710> have<00:05:10.830> to<00:05:11.040> be<00:05:11.160> careful<00:05:11.640> of<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:12.420> one

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
you really have to be careful of and one

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.750 
you really have to be careful of and one
is<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.440> want<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.740> instrument<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.310> be<00:05:14.430> level

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
is you want the instrument to be level

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.670 
is you want the instrument to be level
you'll<00:05:15.480> want<00:05:15.660> to<00:05:15.750> be<00:05:15.810> looking<00:05:16.110> directly<00:05:16.350> at

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
you'll want to be looking directly at

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.610 
you'll want to be looking directly at
the<00:05:16.800> Sun<00:05:16.890> they're<00:05:17.220> upside<00:05:17.550> down<00:05:17.610> or<00:05:18.000> anything

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
the Sun they're upside down or anything

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.700 
the Sun they're upside down or anything
and<00:05:18.890> two<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:20.000> want<00:05:20.180> to<00:05:20.210> pick<00:05:20.420> a<00:05:20.450> site<00:05:20.810> so<00:05:21.680> that

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
and two you want to pick a site so that

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.040 
and two you want to pick a site so that
it's<00:05:22.100> undisturbed<00:05:22.730> I<00:05:23.090> mean<00:05:23.600> who<00:05:23.750> wants<00:05:23.900> to

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
it's undisturbed I mean who wants to

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.660 
it's undisturbed I mean who wants to
look<00:05:24.200> at<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.440> elbe<00:05:24.680> those<00:05:24.890> of<00:05:25.070> our<00:05:25.220> footprints

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
look at the elbe those of our footprints

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.940 
look at the elbe those of our footprints
and<00:05:26.000> then<00:05:26.570> finally<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.260> want<00:05:27.290> to<00:05:27.530> make<00:05:27.590> sure

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
and then finally you want to make sure

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.220 
and then finally you want to make sure
that<00:05:28.490> there's<00:05:28.730> no<00:05:28.940> shadows<00:05:29.510> in<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.840> field<00:05:30.050> of

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
that there's no shadows in the field of

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.620 
that there's no shadows in the field of
view<00:05:30.380> so<00:05:31.310> you're<00:05:31.520> always<00:05:31.700> aiming<00:05:32.090> your<00:05:32.330> albedo

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
view so you're always aiming your albedo

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.320 
view so you're always aiming your albedo
measurements<00:05:33.230> toward<00:05:33.590> the<00:05:33.740> Sun<00:05:33.980> to<00:05:34.880> avoid<00:05:35.180> the

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
measurements toward the Sun to avoid the

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.220 
measurements toward the Sun to avoid the
shadowing<00:05:35.900> and<00:05:36.170> you<00:05:36.530> try<00:05:36.710> to<00:05:36.740> kind<00:05:37.070> of<00:05:37.160> keep

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
shadowing and you try to kind of keep

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.780 
shadowing and you try to kind of keep
the<00:05:39.230> measurement<00:05:39.830> out<00:05:39.920> on<00:05:40.100> your<00:05:40.250> arm<00:05:40.430> as<00:05:40.610> much

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
the measurement out on your arm as much

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.030 
the measurement out on your arm as much
as<00:05:40.970> possible<00:05:41.180> and<00:05:41.780> keep<00:05:41.810> other<00:05:42.380> people<00:05:42.800> away

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
as possible and keep other people away

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.920 
as possible and keep other people away
from<00:05:43.100> the<00:05:43.370> site<00:05:44.650> so<00:05:45.650> what<00:05:45.800> you<00:05:45.950> do<00:05:46.130> you<00:05:46.930> just

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
from the site so what you do you just

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.290 
from the site so what you do you just
kind<00:05:48.260> of<00:05:48.350> stand<00:05:48.590> here<00:05:48.860> again<00:05:49.160> looking<00:05:49.820> towards

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
kind of stand here again looking towards

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.960 
kind of stand here again looking towards
the<00:05:50.360> Sun<00:05:50.600> to<00:05:50.750> minimize<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.290> shadows<00:05:51.770> and<00:05:52.070> if

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
the Sun to minimize the shadows and if

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.910 
the Sun to minimize the shadows and if
you<00:05:53.090> look<00:05:53.270> closely<00:05:53.570> there's<00:05:54.380> a<00:05:54.440> little<00:05:54.740> bubble

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
you look closely there's a little bubble

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.240 
you look closely there's a little bubble
level<00:05:55.400> here<00:05:56.380> that<00:05:57.380> helps<00:05:57.680> be<00:05:57.830> level<00:05:58.130> the

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
level here that helps be level the

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.690 
level here that helps be level the
instrument<00:05:58.760> once<00:05:59.570> I<00:05:59.720> get<00:05:59.900> it<00:06:00.020> leveled<00:06:00.410> I<00:06:00.700> push

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
instrument once I get it leveled I push

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:09.249 
instrument once I get it leveled I push
the<00:06:01.880> button<00:06:03.460> it<00:06:04.460> takes<00:06:04.640> the<00:06:04.850> scan

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.200 

makes<00:06:09.860> a<00:06:09.949> little<00:06:10.069> song<00:06:10.520> for<00:06:10.819> me<00:06:10.939> so<00:06:11.090> I<00:06:11.120> know

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
makes a little song for me so I know

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.209 
makes a little song for me so I know
it's<00:06:11.509> done<00:06:11.689> it<00:06:11.840> can<00:06:12.349> I<00:06:12.439> flip<00:06:12.680> it<00:06:12.830> over<00:06:13.039> again

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:15.219 
it's done it can I flip it over again

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:21.129 
it's done it can I flip it over again
get<00:06:16.219> it<00:06:16.340> nice<00:06:16.490> and<00:06:16.520> level<00:06:16.849> and<00:06:19.960> that's<00:06:20.960> the

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
get it nice and level and that's the

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.950 
get it nice and level and that's the
measurement<00:06:21.699> and<00:06:22.699> then<00:06:22.999> when<00:06:23.150> we<00:06:23.300> process<00:06:23.779> the

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
measurement and then when we process the

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.019 
measurement and then when we process the
data<00:06:24.110> what<00:06:24.439> we'll<00:06:24.590> do<00:06:24.800> is<00:06:25.340> take<00:06:25.460> those<00:06:25.969> two

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:26.029 
data what we'll do is take those two

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:28.360 
data what we'll do is take those two
numbers<00:06:26.499> determine<00:06:27.499> the<00:06:27.590> ratio<00:06:28.009> and<00:06:28.039> that's

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
numbers determine the ratio and that's

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.849 
numbers determine the ratio and that's
the<00:06:28.520> albedo
