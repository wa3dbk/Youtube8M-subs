here's the truck as you can see 162

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.889 
here's the truck as you can see 162
thousand<00:00:05.130> miles

thousand miles

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.780 
thousand miles
there's<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.799> clicking<00:00:08.160> sound<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.460> told<00:00:08.670> you

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
there's the clicking sound I told you

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.140 
there's the clicking sound I told you
about<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.030> actuator<00:00:09.540> for<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.990> vents<00:00:10.620> and

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
about the actuator for the vents and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.490 
about the actuator for the vents and
this<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.509> when<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.750> do<00:00:12.870> when<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.139> turn<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.440> on

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
this is it when I do when you turn it on

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.470 
this is it when I do when you turn it on
and<00:00:13.799> when<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:13.980> turn<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.250> off<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:15.059> makes<00:00:15.360> a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
and when you turn it off it makes a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.019 
and when you turn it off it makes a
sound<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.929> here's<00:00:16.369> there's<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.580> clicking

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
sound so here's there's that clicking

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.660 
sound so here's there's that clicking
that<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.900> vent<00:00:19.140> selection<00:00:19.770> still<00:00:20.010> works<00:00:20.279> it's

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
that the vent selection still works it's

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.040 
that the vent selection still works it's
just<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.029> clicking<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.689> goes<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.050> there

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
just the clicking that goes in there

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.929 
just the clicking that goes in there
this<00:00:25.050> has<00:00:25.350> been<00:00:25.650> run<00:00:25.890> today<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:26.670> cold

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
this has been run today when it's cold

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.140 
this has been run today when it's cold
it<00:00:27.599> smokes<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:28.560> bit<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:29.429> very<00:00:29.670> much<00:00:29.880> but

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
it smokes a little bit not very much but

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.000 
it smokes a little bit not very much but
there<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.390> some<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:33.360> right<00:00:33.719> right<00:00:34.559> now<00:00:34.739> I've

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
there is some and right right now I've

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.740 
there is some and right right now I've
driven<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.550> probably<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.360> mile<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.829> past

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
driven it probably a mile in the past

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.490 
driven it probably a mile in the past
half<00:00:39.750> hour<00:00:39.989> ago<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:42.079> hits<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> great

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
half hour ago and hits the great

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.090 
half hour ago and hits the great
tailgates

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
tailgates

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.369 
tailgates
I<00:00:44.219> told<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.969> about<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.539> would<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.200> was<00:00:46.260> gonna

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
I told you about I would if I was gonna

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
I told you about I would if I was gonna
keep<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.860> would<00:00:46.980> replace<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.940> hood

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
keep it I would replace that in the hood

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.340 
keep it I would replace that in the hood
that's<00:00:49.020> appealing<00:00:49.610> but<00:00:50.610> here's<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
that's appealing but here's a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.860 
that's appealing but here's a
walk-around<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> truck

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.210 

I'll<00:01:00.870> go<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.380> zoom<00:01:01.650> in<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.890> tires<00:01:02.220> later<00:01:04.220> I'll

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
I'll go and zoom in on tires later I'll

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.430 
I'll go and zoom in on tires later I'll
do<00:01:05.489> close-ups<00:01:06.090> two<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.670> lower<00:01:08.670> panels

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
do close-ups two of the lower panels

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:28.910 
do close-ups two of the lower panels
where<00:01:10.440> all<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> rust<00:01:10.890> usually<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.730 

try<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.580> get<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:29.940> much<00:01:30.120> of<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> side<00:01:30.600> there<00:01:30.900> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
try to get as much of the side there you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.020 
try to get as much of the side there you
can<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:32.070> some<00:01:32.280> paint<00:01:32.790> peeling<00:01:33.260> on<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.350> top

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
can see some paint peeling on the top

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.890 
can see some paint peeling on the top
and<00:01:36.200> fading<00:01:37.200> right<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:38.570> let<00:01:39.570> me<00:01:39.600> show<00:01:39.690> you

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
and fading right here let me show you

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.590 
and fading right here let me show you
the<00:01:42.380> panel's<00:01:43.380> here<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:43.979> see<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:45.240> really

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the panel's here you can see it's really

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.270 
the panel's here you can see it's really
clean<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.900> little<00:01:46.380> bit<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> surface<00:01:46.830> on<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
clean a little bit of surface on the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.109 
clean a little bit of surface on the
frame<00:01:47.610> surface<00:01:48.420> rust<00:01:48.660> but<00:01:49.880> really<00:01:50.880> clean

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
frame surface rust but really clean

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.630 
frame surface rust but really clean
right<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.440> other<00:01:52.590> spots<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.100> rust

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
right there the other spots of rust

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.920 
right there the other spots of rust
that's<00:01:54.509> all<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:55.080> clean<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.880> right<00:01:57.479> here

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
that's all really clean and right here

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:10.149 
that's all really clean and right here
there's<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:59.070> corner<00:01:59.460> super<00:02:00.360> clean<00:02:02.060> no<00:02:03.060> rust

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.429 

and<00:02:11.159> they<00:02:11.819> usually<00:02:11.969> a<00:02:12.689> little<00:02:13.019> bit<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.260> rust

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
and they usually a little bit of rust

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.240 
and they usually a little bit of rust
here<00:02:14.749> to<00:02:15.749> adjust

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.580 

anyway<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.390> can't<00:02:19.630> see<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.020> but<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:23.230> those<00:02:23.440> are

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
anyway you can't see it but so those are

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.820 
anyway you can't see it but so those are
the<00:02:23.740> panels<00:02:24.160> they're<00:02:25.260> right<00:02:26.260> here<00:02:26.770> oh<00:02:28.830> there's

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
the panels they're right here oh there's

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.520 
the panels they're right here oh there's
a<00:02:30.510> little<00:02:31.510> bit<00:02:31.660> of<00:02:31.750> bubbling<00:02:32.110> in<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.320> paint

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
a little bit of bubbling in the paint

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.490 
a little bit of bubbling in the paint
and<00:02:33.430> notice<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.210> before<00:02:34.390> here's<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.260> dent

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
and notice that before here's the dent

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.460 
and notice that before here's the dent
that<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:37.860> mentioned<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.010> phone<00:02:40.470> right

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
that I mentioned on the phone right

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.000 
that I mentioned on the phone right
there<00:02:41.710> behind<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.070> tire<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:44.290> tires<00:02:44.560> are<00:02:44.890> in

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
there behind that tire the tires are in

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.850 
there behind that tire the tires are in
really<00:02:45.040> good<00:02:45.400> shape<00:02:46.290> good<00:02:47.290> amount<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.590> tread

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
really good shape good amount of tread

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.410 
really good shape good amount of tread
black<00:02:48.070> clear<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:50.080> before<00:02:50.170> there<00:02:50.560> anything

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.600 

other<00:02:55.420> than<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.320> this<00:02:56.620> sides<00:02:56.890> just<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.370> same

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
other than that this sides just the same

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.210 
other than that this sides just the same
as<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.910> other<00:02:58.590> no<00:02:59.590> rush

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.360 

so<00:03:05.900> that's<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.260> let<00:03:07.590> me<00:03:07.620> pop<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.010> hood<00:03:08.160> you

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
so that's that let me pop the hood you

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.120 
so that's that let me pop the hood you
can<00:03:08.430> see<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.850> engine<00:03:09.620> piloting<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.680> video<00:03:10.980> if

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
can see the engine piloting a video if

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.900 
can see the engine piloting a video if
you<00:03:11.220> continue<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:13.230> seats<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.280> good<00:03:14.610> shape

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
you continue to the seats and good shape

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.890 
you continue to the seats and good shape
a<00:03:19.970> little<00:03:20.970> bit<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.360> stain<00:03:21.630> right<00:03:21.840> there

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
a little bit of a stain right there

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.660 
a little bit of a stain right there
looks<00:03:22.530> like<00:03:22.680> somebody<00:03:22.950> spilled<00:03:23.130> coffee<00:03:23.370> or

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670

something

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.330 
something
the<00:03:24.780> backbench<00:03:25.260> has<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> little<00:03:25.890> bit<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.280> can

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
the backbench has a little bit you can

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.610 
the backbench has a little bit you can
see<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.060> little<00:03:27.150> bit<00:03:27.330> dirty<00:03:27.510> but<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:30.620> can

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
see it's a little bit dirty but you can

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.180 
see it's a little bit dirty but you can
see<00:03:31.830> there's<00:03:32.040> no<00:03:32.220> tears<00:03:32.520> or<00:03:33.450> anything<00:03:34.190> major

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
see there's no tears or anything major

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.870 
see there's no tears or anything major
to<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.640> interior<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:39.080> runs<00:03:40.080> great<00:03:40.880> the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
to the interior and runs great the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.840 
to the interior and runs great the
clutch<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.360> super<00:03:42.750> tight<00:03:43.250> trans<00:03:44.250> shifts

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
clutch is super tight trans shifts

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.740 
clutch is super tight trans shifts
really<00:03:45.180> tight

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
really tight

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:57.980 
really tight
even<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:54.330> engine<00:03:54.600> sounds<00:03:56.600> anyway<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:57.660> that's

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
even the engine sounds anyway so that's

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.590 
even the engine sounds anyway so that's
truck

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.010 

yeah<00:04:03.600> even<00:04:03.840> gadgets<00:04:04.410> like<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:05.250> turn<00:04:05.490> signal

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
yeah even gadgets like the turn signal

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:16.160 
yeah even gadgets like the turn signal
we<00:04:07.020> need<00:04:07.580> it's<00:04:08.580> really<00:04:08.700> tight<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.930> doors

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
we need it's really tight and the doors

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.830 
we need it's really tight and the doors
shut<00:04:17.010> really<00:04:17.400> well

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.029 

anyway<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:23.900> that's<00:04:24.259> the<00:04:24.470> Jeanette's

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
anyway so that's the Jeanette's

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.070 
anyway so that's the Jeanette's
there's<00:04:25.639> the<00:04:25.909> truck<00:04:26.270> I<00:04:26.419> don't<00:04:26.509> know<00:04:26.629> what<00:04:26.750> to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
there's the truck I don't know what to

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.499 
there's the truck I don't know what to
say<00:04:27.110> about<00:04:27.289> it<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:28.280> can<00:04:28.849> take<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.060> out<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.180> drive

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
say about it I can take it out and drive

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.719 
say about it I can take it out and drive
it<00:04:29.719> but<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:29.930> don't<00:04:30.110> think<00:04:30.229> you'd<00:04:30.409> really<00:04:30.729> notice

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
it but I don't think you'd really notice

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.760 
it but I don't think you'd really notice
that<00:04:31.819> much<00:04:32.030> this<00:04:32.270> gauge<00:04:32.599> seen<00:04:33.439> it<00:04:33.530> on<00:04:33.680> the

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
that much this gauge seen it on the

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.920 
that much this gauge seen it on the
video<00:04:34.009> remind<00:04:34.250> me<00:04:34.389> is<00:04:35.389> off

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
video remind me is off

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.059 
video remind me is off
I<00:04:35.960> checked<00:04:36.469> the<00:04:36.590> voltage<00:04:36.889> with<00:04:37.039> the

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
I checked the voltage with the

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.709 
I checked the voltage with the
multimeter<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:37.699> it's<00:04:37.849> at<00:04:38.090> 14<00:04:38.539> and<00:04:38.659> a<00:04:38.689> half

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:38.719 
multimeter and it's at 14 and a half

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:40.869 
multimeter and it's at 14 and a half
volts<00:04:39.229> so<00:04:39.439> I<00:04:39.650> don't<00:04:40.280> know<00:04:40.340> why<00:04:40.460> it's<00:04:40.610> reading

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879 
volts so I don't know why it's reading

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:48.779 
volts so I don't know why it's reading
way<00:04:41.030> up<00:04:41.150> there<00:04:41.360> but<00:04:42.490> good<00:04:43.490> oil<00:04:43.729> pressure

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:55.899 

that's<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:49.969> rig<00:04:51.639> horn<00:04:52.639> works<00:04:52.849> too<00:04:54.909> good

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
that's the rig horn works too good

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.700 
that's the rig horn works too good
there's<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.270> clicking<00:04:56.569> again<00:04:56.810> that<00:04:57.530> goes

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
there's that clicking again that goes

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.119 
there's that clicking again that goes
for<00:04:58.069> like<00:04:58.310> 10<00:04:58.580> seconds<00:04:59.000> and<00:04:59.180> then<00:04:59.360> it<00:04:59.539> stops

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:00.129 
for like 10 seconds and then it stops

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:17.980 
for like 10 seconds and then it stops
I'll<00:05:01.129> let<00:05:01.340> you<00:05:01.490> hear<00:05:16.029> and<00:05:17.029> that's<00:05:17.210> it<00:05:17.419> does

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
I'll let you hear and that's it does

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.059 
I'll let you hear and that's it does
that<00:05:18.139> when<00:05:18.259> you<00:05:18.319> turn<00:05:18.500> it<00:05:18.620> on<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:18.770> when<00:05:19.009> you

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069 
that when you turn it on and when you

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.589 
that when you turn it on and when you
turn<00:05:19.310> when<00:05:19.669> you<00:05:19.729> turn<00:05:19.939> the<00:05:20.029> truck<00:05:20.210> on<00:05:20.360> and<00:05:20.509> when

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
turn when you turn the truck on and when

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.779 
turn when you turn the truck on and when
you<00:05:20.659> turn<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:20.930> truck<00:05:21.080> off<00:05:21.259> I<00:05:21.560> don't<00:05:22.310> know<00:05:22.400> if

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
you turn the truck off I don't know if

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:28.149 
you turn the truck off I don't know if
you<00:05:22.939> can<00:05:23.090> tell<00:05:23.300> but<00:05:25.120> whoops<00:05:26.120> well<00:05:26.539> back<00:05:26.810> up<00:05:27.159> you

you can tell but whoops well back up you

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.550 
you can tell but whoops well back up you
can<00:05:28.340> see<00:05:28.810> first<00:05:29.810> second<00:05:30.469> third<00:05:30.919> fourth<00:05:31.219> fifth

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
can see first second third fourth fifth

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:42.629 
can see first second third fourth fifth
they<00:05:33.560> all<00:05:33.680> go<00:05:33.889> in<00:05:34.090> really<00:05:35.090> easy<00:05:36.610> in<00:05:37.610> Reverse

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.129 

yeah<00:05:43.639> I<00:05:43.849> mean<00:05:44.060> what<00:05:44.629> can<00:05:44.719> you<00:05:44.779> tell<00:05:44.960> by<00:05:45.080> the

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
yeah I mean what can you tell by the

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.499 
yeah I mean what can you tell by the
video<00:05:45.289> but<00:05:45.650> it<00:05:46.250> all<00:05:46.669> works<00:05:46.849> really<00:05:46.940> well<00:05:47.210> even

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
video but it all works really well even

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.050 
video but it all works really well even
the<00:05:48.580> four-wheel<00:05:49.580> drive

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
the four-wheel drive

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.169
