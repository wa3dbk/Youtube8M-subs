00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:11.880
 High 3 Pu-liter is in the box of the store this time following the last time I would like to make the strengthening of the snare 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:16.139
 Snare of recent edmar dubstep Te putter N'with the feeling that the tail is extended a little 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.320
 Let's extend the tail in the I think that there are many to say 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.010
 I'll come back next time to the room sound source 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.670
 b One will be the real sound tanto 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:33.190
 It will be another one soon in charge of the tail part of the house 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:35.290
 Then it is easy to understand if you give a copy to the pus in the clip 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.310
 Let's make the tail part 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:45.470
 The noise is generated using this vocoder and how to make it 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:50.960
 Here is the point Drag and drop the vocoder behind the waveform 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:55.760
 As we explained how to use vocoder with video before, please see that in detail 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:01.060
 First of all , select know is by carrier below know is 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.060
 Adjust the texture of your favorite noise in the controller 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:13.880
 I think this is just right on the left 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.880
 Cut low gradually over time in the filter bank in the middle 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:26.180
 It is about 71 percent depth 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.180
 And the attack is around 3.16 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.729
 Sound quality has changed a lot 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.729
 After that, let's extend the tail of the noise with release 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:48.960
 It may be just right I 'll put the reverb next 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.110
 Yes cut off and chorus also dry wet about 50% is just right 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.110
 Ne 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.340
 Then use the auto filter to cut extra regulars 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.800
 Make it a high pass 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.310
 It was 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.500
 Four 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:12.480
 Finally, I use the gate to cut off the nobita tail with a sense of rhythm. 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:18.470
 Because the noise below this gate threshold is reduced 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.470
 If the threshold is on the left, the gate will not pass and pass 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.750
 At the right, the volume is lower than the threshold so it sounds on the gate 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.750
 not 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.350
 When playing back , the waveform appears here, so adjust the length to match the rhythm while watching the waveform 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.550
 It is easy to do 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.550
 Let's do it 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:54.860
 This about is just good Neato of wood cut even sound that it remains this is is attached to the sputtering 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.860
 With this release the cut will be smoothed out 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.489
 b 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.459
 This is just right 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:14.950
 After you adjust the amount of noise of to the actual sound 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.580
 This is the second icon from below Click this to display a list 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.520
 This line is coming 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:28.240
 The thing that I entrusted is judged blue in this way, the upper one is a real sound and the lower one is insane 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.240
 Will continue to adjust the volume you in the in this volume cage 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.290
 About 14 to 15 in Touma 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:43.920
 I think that I think we said in feeling that is growing is Gena rather than the tail tumbled 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:49.260
 It is an effector that hangs over the entire drum rack here 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.760
 Just as with google comp , it 's about holding on like a drum and going to issue 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.760
 Align the threshold to 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.719
 And with makeup 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.719
 When you open the decibel 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:22.880
 Patty and the sea of ​​clouds is a hard curve ー d something now has become 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:29.680
 So this time the next time is the end 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.680
 Thank you very much, I think I want to do the lift of the entire hi-hat and beat 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:35.519
