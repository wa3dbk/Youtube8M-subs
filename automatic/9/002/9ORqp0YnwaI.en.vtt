I gotta admit something I love using the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.279 
I gotta admit something I love using the
shotgun<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:19.760> it<00:00:20.760> really<00:00:21.180> fits<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.689> play

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.790 
shotgun it's it really fits my play
style<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.890> pray<00:00:23.189> pretty<00:00:23.550> aggressive<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.800> so

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
style I pray pretty aggressive and so

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.120 
style I pray pretty aggressive and so
I'm<00:00:25.859> using<00:00:26.070> my<00:00:26.449> shotgun<00:00:27.449> w<00:00:27.869> 1200<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> grip

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
I'm using my shotgun w 1200 with a grip

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.759 
I'm using my shotgun w 1200 with a grip
and<00:00:29.400> juggernaut<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.119> extreme<00:00:31.080> conditioning

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and juggernaut and extreme conditioning

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.270 
and juggernaut and extreme conditioning
so<00:00:32.540> using<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.840> joking<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:34.770> an<00:00:34.980> extreme

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
so using just joking out an extreme

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.979 
so using just joking out an extreme
conditioning<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.270> makes<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.600> hard<00:00:36.840> to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
conditioning really makes you hard to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.119 
conditioning really makes you hard to
kill<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.430> run<00:00:39.000> really<00:00:39.480> fast<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.129> would

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
kill you just run really fast and would

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.530 
kill you just run really fast and would
stand<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.670> more<00:00:41.910> damage<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.420> would

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
stand a little more damage I would

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
stand a little more damage I would
recommend<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.379> that's<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> only<00:00:44.340> time

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
recommend actually that's the only time

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.889 
recommend actually that's the only time
I<00:00:44.579> would<00:00:44.910> actually<00:00:45.030> recommend<00:00:45.390> using

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
I would actually recommend using

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.290 
I would actually recommend using
juggernaut<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:46.770> you're<00:00:46.890> using<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
juggernaut it's when you're using a

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.959 
juggernaut it's when you're using a
shotgun<00:00:48.300> because<00:00:49.170> anytime<00:00:50.070> else<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.670> pretty

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
shotgun because anytime else it's pretty

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.770 
shotgun because anytime else it's pretty

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
as you can see we don't have any GFE so

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.110 
as you can see we don't have any GFE so
I<00:04:29.139> pull<00:04:29.380> in<00:04:29.500> my<00:04:29.590> shop<00:04:29.889> or<00:04:30.160> used<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.490> be<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:31.000> the
