00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.819 
checked it out I saw it like right away
and<00:00:31.279> I<00:00:32.510> thought<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.780> would<00:00:33.840> talk<00:00:34.260> about<00:00:34.290> that

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
and I thought I would talk about that

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
and I thought I would talk about that
today<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.750> mind<00:00:37.050> so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
today because it is on my mind so

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.630 
today because it is on my mind so
basically<00:00:37.680> what<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> pull<00:00:38.520> up

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
basically what you do is you pull up

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
basically what you do is you pull up
Google<00:00:38.670> Maps<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.200> hit<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> search<00:00:40.680> bar

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

cool and the fact that they actually did
anything<00:01:45.270> instead<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.110> making<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
anything instead of just making the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
crazy video i like that but it's

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.670

obviously<00:01:50.280> lacking<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:51.000> lot<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.570> i<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.079> some

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
obviously lacking a lot and i have some

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.190 
obviously lacking a lot and i have some
amazing<00:01:53.189> ideas<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:54.329> should<00:01:54.630> happen<00:01:54.840> whether

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
amazing ideas that should happen whether

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.469 
amazing ideas that should happen whether
it's<00:01:55.439> Google<00:01:55.619> or<00:01:55.950> Nintendo<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.790> does<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.240> I

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479
