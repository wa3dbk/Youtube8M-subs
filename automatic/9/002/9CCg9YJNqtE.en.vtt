00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.970
 well we do the review of 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.680
 difference in size this is a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.769
 phone as little as you can see these 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.690
 the samsung mega this is the ipad 2 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.400
 that's right for the skin size 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.600
 we are talking about bigger phone 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.930
 possible now is this instead is ipad 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.580
 mini then the small version that yes 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.930
 can hold out a hand we can hold 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.779
 the rubber hand but in this way vi 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.250
 the three fingers remain with all and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.800
 four fingers is possible but in short 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.630
 we are right on the limits but there is the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.320
 possibility with one hand to hold them with 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.059
 the other to interact with the same thing 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.250
 this is the maximum phone you can 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.840
 instead bring it easily to the ear 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.710
 because the hand can grasp it like this 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.039
 better 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.300
 the ipad mini se is worth buying 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.520
 one already owns the samsung mega here 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.070
 this maybe who knows maybe of the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.850
 he asks that some of you will be 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.500
 done 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.710
 we see the dimensions well we see it 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.100
 for horizontal this way is fine 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.590
 so let's see the phone above it 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:18.530
 we see it this way so we see it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.530
 through the thicknesses ok this 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.899
 these are the shims we operate in 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.979
 both a game we see the playability 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:36.470
 and ok ideas ideas I go 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:40.509
 at the same time to push written a 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.509
 second after the mega samsung 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:02:06.630
 slightly faster with nicola paoli 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:08.729
 in faster boat the faster he does not have it 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:14.150
 won beetle ipad is slightly 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.150
 decidedly faster and ipad 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.870
 ok 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.130
 knows that I am beautiful
