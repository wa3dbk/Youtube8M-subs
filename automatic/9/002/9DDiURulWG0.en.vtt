cities XL and SimCity considering the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.230 
cities XL and SimCity considering the
fact<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.560> paid<00:00:07.770> $60<00:00:08.550> for<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.760> game<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.030> I

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
fact that I paid $60 for a game that I

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.360 
fact that I paid $60 for a game that I

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
can't even play at the moment it's now

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.490 
can't even play at the moment it's now
been<00:00:11.759> three<00:00:12.240> days<00:00:12.420> since<00:00:12.480> launch<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.410> have

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
been three days since launch and I have

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.410 
been three days since launch and I have
yet<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.769> be<00:00:13.980> able<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.219> play<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.549> game<00:00:14.730> for<00:00:14.759> 48

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
yet to be able to play the game for 48

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.390 
yet to be able to play the game for 48
straight<00:00:15.750> hours<00:00:15.809> because<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.920> servers<00:00:17.279> are

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
straight hours because the servers are

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.250 
straight hours because the servers are
too<00:00:17.550> busy<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.119> updating<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.020> when<00:00:19.170> it

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
too busy it's updating so when it

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.340 
too busy it's updating so when it
restarts<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.830> crashes<00:00:20.310> all<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.000> sort<00:00:21.270> of

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
restarts it crashes all that sort of

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.050 
restarts it crashes all that sort of
nonsensical<00:00:22.350> stuff<00:00:22.590> considering<00:00:23.400> EA<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.850> one

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
nonsensical stuff considering EA is one

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.429 
nonsensical stuff considering EA is one
of<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.210> biggest<00:00:24.420> game<00:00:24.750> publishers<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
of the biggest game publishers in the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.230 
of the biggest game publishers in the
world<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:26.010> would<00:00:26.250> expect<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.699> they<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
world I would expect that they have the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.790 
world I would expect that they have the
means<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.779> able<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.960> provide<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.410> servers

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
means to be able to provide the servers

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040 
means to be able to provide the servers
and<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.970> think<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> capability<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.929> that

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
and like I think the capability is that

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.420 
and like I think the capability is that
they<00:00:31.140> would<00:00:31.260> need<00:00:31.500> knowing<00:00:32.130> what<00:00:32.250> they<00:00:32.369> were

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
they would need knowing what they were

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.470 
they would need knowing what they were
getting<00:00:32.579> themselves<00:00:32.850> into<00:00:33.239> with

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
getting themselves into with

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.690 
getting themselves into with
always-online<00:00:34.020> DRM<00:00:34.250> which<00:00:35.250> that's<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
always-online DRM which that's a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.709 
always-online DRM which that's a
completely<00:00:36.030> different<00:00:36.210> story<00:00:36.480> that's

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
completely different story that's

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.799 
completely different story that's
completely<00:00:37.730> unnecessary<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.000> they're<00:00:39.600> doing

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
completely unnecessary and they're doing

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.360 
completely unnecessary and they're doing
whatever<00:00:40.050> they<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.620> garner<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.160> much

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
whatever they can to garner as much

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.190 
whatever they can to garner as much
money<00:00:41.579> as<00:00:41.730> possible<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.780> makes<00:00:43.020> me

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
money as possible and it really makes me

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.959 
money as possible and it really makes me
mad<00:00:43.230> as<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.890> well<00:00:44.160> as<00:00:44.250> many<00:00:44.430> other<00:00:44.640> people<00:00:44.789> that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
mad as as well as many other people that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.119 
mad as as well as many other people that
we<00:00:45.480> pay<00:00:45.629> $60<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.350> game<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.559> can't<00:00:46.950> even

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
we pay $60 for a game and can't even

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.430 
we pay $60 for a game and can't even
play<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> still<00:00:47.969> three<00:00:48.660> days<00:00:48.809> after<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> comes

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
play it still three days after it comes

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.319 
play it still three days after it comes
out<00:00:49.680> most<00:00:50.160> most<00:00:50.550> games<00:00:50.789> would<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.149> their

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
out most most games would have their

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.410 
out most most games would have their
issue<00:00:51.510> solved<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.110> 24<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> 48<00:00:53.129> hours<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
issue solved in 24 to 48 hours but the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.959 
issue solved in 24 to 48 hours but the
you<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.379> initially<00:00:55.710> EA<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.340> denied<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
you know initially EA just denied the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.310 
you know initially EA just denied the
fact<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.510> game<00:00:57.690> wasn't<00:00:57.899> working

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
fact that the game wasn't working

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.020 
fact that the game wasn't working
properly<00:00:58.500> they<00:00:58.890> they<00:00:59.250> remove<00:00:59.670> things<00:00:59.879> like

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
properly they they remove things like

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.670 
properly they they remove things like
cheetah<00:01:00.449> speed<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.989> hope<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.559> would

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
cheetah speed and hope that it would

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.979 
cheetah speed and hope that it would
reduce<00:01:02.039> server<00:01:02.520> load<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.059> obviously<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
reduce server load and obviously it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.690 
reduce server load and obviously it
hasn't<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.220> servers<00:01:05.549> are

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
hasn't because all of the servers are

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.039 
hasn't because all of the servers are
literally<00:01:06.090> busy<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> point<00:01:06.840> where<00:01:06.960> you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
literally busy to the point where you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.730 
literally busy to the point where you
can't<00:01:07.290> even<00:01:07.350> select<00:01:07.920> them<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:09.119> insanity<00:01:09.740> now

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
can't even select them it's insanity now

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.010 
can't even select them it's insanity now
I<00:01:11.070> wanted<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.640> go<00:01:11.729> over<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.479> differences<00:01:12.869> like

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
I wanted to go over the differences like

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.830 
I wanted to go over the differences like
I<00:01:13.140> said<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.920> wanted<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.369> I'll<00:01:15.000> keep<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.360> brief

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
I said so I wanted to I'll keep it brief

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.649 
I said so I wanted to I'll keep it brief
now<00:01:16.110> Cities<00:01:16.950> XL<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.460> actually<00:01:18.060> single-player

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
of stuff waste pollution so there are

different respects maybe they tried
smaller<00:03:19.350> plot<00:03:19.620> sizes<00:03:19.829> because<00:03:20.190> they<00:03:20.310> wanted

smaller plot sizes because they wanted

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.310 
smaller plot sizes because they wanted

which<00:03:25.769> sort<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.100> makes<00:03:26.280> sense<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:26.640> there

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
which sort of makes sense but there

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.479 
which sort of makes sense but there
should<00:03:26.940> be<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.180> option<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.540> do<00:03:27.660> both

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
should be the option to do both

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.830 
should be the option to do both
eliminating<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.820> one<00:03:30.090> thinking<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.660> one

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
player will want to do the same thing as

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.979 
player will want to do the same thing as
ridiculous<00:03:35.209> one<00:03:36.209> thing<00:03:36.329> that<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.510> can't<00:03:36.810> hate

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
ridiculous one thing that I can't hate

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.539 
ridiculous one thing that I can't hate
on<00:03:37.049> some<00:03:37.380> city<00:03:37.590> for<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.069> fact<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.370> it

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
on some city for is the fact that it

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.300 
on some city for is the fact that it
looks<00:03:38.819> and<00:03:39.120> sounds<00:03:39.390> fantastic<00:03:40.319> which<00:03:40.769> is<00:03:40.980> no

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
looks and sounds fantastic which is no

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.130 
looks and sounds fantastic which is no
doubt<00:03:41.489> true<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:42.000> game<00:03:42.150> does<00:03:42.450> look<00:03:42.480> very<00:03:42.900> good

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
doubt true the game does look very good

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.569 
doubt true the game does look very good
for<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.440> few<00:03:43.620> minutes<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.040> have<00:03:44.280> actually

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
for the few minutes that I have actually

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.520 
for the few minutes that I have actually
played<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.690> sounds<00:03:45.989> really<00:03:46.019> good<00:03:46.319> the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
played it and it sounds really good the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.740 
played it and it sounds really good the
music<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:47.040> relatively<00:03:47.910> nice<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.510> the

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
music is relatively nice and the the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.320 
music is relatively nice and the the
sound<00:03:49.019> effects<00:03:49.260> are<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:50.040> mean

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
sound effects are I mean

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.090 
sound effects are I mean
I<00:03:51.390> guess<00:03:51.960> you<00:03:52.080> can't<00:03:52.260> really<00:03:52.440> judge<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.710> sound

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
I guess you can't really judge the sound

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.010 
I guess you can't really judge the sound
effects<00:03:53.370> because<00:03:53.670> they<00:03:54.000> probably<00:03:54.420> made<00:03:54.840> them

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
effects because they probably made them

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.930 
effects because they probably made them
themselves<00:03:55.500> but<00:03:55.650> they're<00:03:55.920> pretty<00:03:56.100> good<00:03:56.250> so

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
themselves but they're pretty good so

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.450 
themselves but they're pretty good so
also<00:03:57.900> another<00:03:58.410> really<00:03:58.830> important<00:03:59.160> thing<00:03:59.190> as

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
also another really important thing as

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.430 
also another really important thing as
cities<00:03:59.730> Excel<00:04:00.090> doesn't<00:04:00.420> have<00:04:00.750> like<00:04:01.170> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
cities Excel doesn't have like the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.740 
cities Excel doesn't have like the
massive<00:04:01.740> failure<00:04:02.400> cushion<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:03.000> SimCity

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
massive failure cushion that SimCity

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.890 
massive failure cushion that SimCity
does<00:04:03.960> with<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.620> with<00:04:04.950> EA<00:04:05.190> because<00:04:05.550> EA<00:04:06.120> has<00:04:06.480> who

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
does with the with EA because EA has who

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.900 
does with the with EA because EA has who
knows<00:04:06.930> how<00:04:07.410> much<00:04:07.530> profit<00:04:07.800> but<00:04:08.100> enough<00:04:08.700> money

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
knows how much profit but enough money

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.540 
knows how much profit but enough money
to<00:04:09.060> be<00:04:09.150> able<00:04:09.210> to<00:04:09.810> support<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.410> SimCity<00:04:10.950> genre

to be able to support the SimCity genre

to be able to support the SimCity genre

make all of the other like city builder
game<00:04:20.670> developers<00:04:21.299> not<00:04:21.540> want<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.959> pursue<00:04:22.290> this

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
game developers not want to pursue this

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.750 
game developers not want to pursue this
thing<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.860> investors<00:04:23.370> who<00:04:23.490> are<00:04:23.520> going<00:04:23.700> to

support the developers that want to make

support the developers that want to make
a<00:04:25.410> game<00:04:25.680> like<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:25.920> that's<00:04:26.640> I<00:04:27.540> think<00:04:28.080> one<00:04:28.410> of

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
a game like this that's I think one of

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.590 
a game like this that's I think one of
the<00:04:28.590> biggest<00:04:28.920> issues<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:29.400> because<00:04:29.430> SimCity<00:04:30.390> is

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
the biggest issues is because SimCity is

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.300 
the biggest issues is because SimCity is
no<00:04:30.900> doubt<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.320> biggest<00:04:31.470> title<00:04:31.980> out<00:04:32.100> there

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
no doubt the biggest title out there

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.160 
no doubt the biggest title out there
everyone<00:04:32.760> knows<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.240> when<00:04:33.480> you<00:04:33.570> mention<00:04:33.960> city

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
everyone knows it when you mention city

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.920 
everyone knows it when you mention city
builder<00:04:34.470> games<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:35.220> if<00:04:35.550> this<00:04:35.760> fails<00:04:36.150> all<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
builder games so if this fails all the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.540 
builder games so if this fails all the
investors<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:37.410> would<00:04:37.770> potentially<00:04:37.920> invest

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
investors that would potentially invest

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.580 
investors that would potentially invest
in<00:04:38.700> another<00:04:38.910> smaller<00:04:39.270> companies<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:40.500> know

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
in another smaller companies you know

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.930 
in another smaller companies you know
production<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.160> city<00:04:41.370> builder<00:04:41.640> game<00:04:41.760> is

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
production of a city builder game is

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.000 
production of a city builder game is
probably<00:04:42.330> not<00:04:42.600> gonna<00:04:43.080> like<00:04:43.440> it's<00:04:43.770> not<00:04:43.830> gonna

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
probably not gonna like it's not gonna

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.590 
probably not gonna like it's not gonna
be<00:04:44.100> as<00:04:44.250> likely<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.790> happen<00:04:44.940> which<00:04:45.210> really

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
be as likely to happen which really

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.730 
be as likely to happen which really
really<00:04:45.870> sucks<00:04:47.120> also<00:04:48.120> Cities<00:04:48.810> excel<00:04:49.140> does<00:04:49.530> not

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
really sucks also Cities excel does not

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.980 
really sucks also Cities excel does not
have<00:04:50.010> multiplayer<00:04:50.370> while<00:04:50.790> SimCity<00:04:51.360> does<00:04:51.660> but

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
have multiplayer while SimCity does but

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.360 
have multiplayer while SimCity does but
most<00:04:52.140> of<00:04:52.290> us<00:04:52.380> can't<00:04:52.650> even<00:04:52.710> connect<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.250> the

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
most of us can't even connect to the

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.370 
most of us can't even connect to the
SimCity<00:04:53.820> game<00:04:54.090> al<00:04:54.270> let<00:04:54.960> alone<00:04:55.170> the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
SimCity game al let alone the

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.980 
SimCity game al let alone the
multiplayer<00:04:55.919> so<00:04:56.430> we<00:04:56.850> can't<00:04:57.090> even<00:04:57.330> really<00:04:57.510> talk

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
multiplayer so we can't even really talk

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.230 
multiplayer so we can't even really talk
about<00:04:58.260> that<00:04:58.440> there's<00:04:59.160> probably<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.610> mod<00:05:00.000> out

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
about that there's probably a mod out

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.970 
about that there's probably a mod out
there<00:05:00.419> for<00:05:00.600> Cities<00:05:00.810> XL<00:05:00.960> multiplayer<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.650> just

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
there for Cities XL multiplayer I just

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.820 
there for Cities XL multiplayer I just
don't<00:05:02.550> know<00:05:02.730> about<00:05:02.880> it<00:05:03.350> most<00:05:04.350> importantly

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
don't know about it most importantly

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.310 
don't know about it most importantly
Cities<00:05:05.460> excel<00:05:05.790> does<00:05:05.940> not<00:05:06.210> use<00:05:06.600> always-online

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
Cities excel does not use always-online

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.070 
Cities excel does not use always-online
DRM<00:05:07.520> which<00:05:08.520> like<00:05:08.790> I<00:05:08.910> said<00:05:09.090> earlier<00:05:09.419> is<00:05:09.600> just<00:05:09.630> EA

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
DRM which like I said earlier is just EA

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.930 
DRM which like I said earlier is just EA
being<00:05:10.440> as<00:05:10.590> greedy<00:05:10.980> as<00:05:11.160> they<00:05:11.310> possibly<00:05:11.700> can

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
being as greedy as they possibly can

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.570 
being as greedy as they possibly can
which<00:05:12.180> is<00:05:12.440> absolutely<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.680> truth<00:05:13.830> there's<00:05:14.250> no

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
which is absolutely the truth there's no

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.120 
which is absolutely the truth there's no
other<00:05:14.820> reason<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.840> think<00:05:16.710> just<00:05:17.010> like

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
other reason I think just like

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.770 
other reason I think just like
totalbiscuit<00:05:17.490> said<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.120> only<00:05:18.360> reason

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
totalbiscuit said the only reason

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.770 
totalbiscuit said the only reason
always-online<00:05:19.620> DRM<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:20.340> OK<00:05:20.760> is<00:05:20.970> when<00:05:21.480> the<00:05:21.600> game

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
always-online DRM is OK is when the game

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.080 
always-online DRM is OK is when the game
is<00:05:21.960> entirely<00:05:22.350> free<00:05:22.710> to<00:05:22.740> free-to-play<00:05:23.610> which<00:05:23.850> I

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
is entirely free to free-to-play which I

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.900 
is entirely free to free-to-play which I
agree<00:05:24.480> with<00:05:24.510> 100%<00:05:25.169> I<00:05:25.530> just<00:05:25.740> a<00:05:25.800> spot<00:05:26.130> on<00:05:26.160> just

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
agree with 100% I just a spot on just

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.430 
agree with 100% I just a spot on just
think<00:05:27.090> like<00:05:27.510> if<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:27.990> game<00:05:28.110> is<00:05:28.260> free-to-play

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
think like if the game is free-to-play

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.490 
think like if the game is free-to-play
you<00:05:29.130> buying<00:05:29.430> little<00:05:29.700> things<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.410> you<00:05:31.410> know

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
you buying little things and you know

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.260 
you buying little things and you know
you<00:05:31.530> not<00:05:31.980> pirating<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.460> game<00:05:32.669> is<00:05:32.820> essential

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
you not pirating the game is essential

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.190 
you not pirating the game is essential
to<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.480> game<00:05:33.600> company's<00:05:34.050> survival<00:05:34.350> but<00:05:34.740> for<00:05:35.610> a

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
to the game company's survival but for a

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.719 
to the game company's survival but for a
company<00:05:37.200> as<00:05:37.470> big<00:05:37.500> as<00:05:37.710> EA<00:05:38.040> who's<00:05:38.340> been<00:05:38.550> around

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
company as big as EA who's been around

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:39.920 
company as big as EA who's been around
for<00:05:38.880> as<00:05:39.060> long<00:05:39.090> as<00:05:39.240> they<00:05:39.450> have<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.810> use

always-on online DRM

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.550 
always-on online DRM
it<00:05:41.850> is<00:05:42.330> just<00:05:42.510> crazy<00:05:42.660> and<00:05:43.020> I<00:05:43.050> don't<00:05:43.110> think<00:05:43.470> we're

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
it is just crazy and I don't think we're

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.710 
it is just crazy and I don't think we're
gonna<00:05:43.620> see<00:05:43.919> it<00:05:44.040> change<00:05:44.310> like<00:05:44.510> Ubisoft<00:05:45.510> or

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
gonna see it change like Ubisoft or

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.350 
gonna see it change like Ubisoft or
Ubisoft<00:05:46.320> are<00:05:46.500> you<00:05:46.710> say<00:05:46.919> it<00:05:47.010> they<00:05:47.669> they<00:05:48.090> went

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
Ubisoft are you say it they they went

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.210 
Ubisoft are you say it they they went
against<00:05:48.780> their<00:05:49.020> like<00:05:49.410> they<00:05:49.560> turned<00:05:49.800> off<00:05:50.040> their

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
against their like they turned off their

against their like they turned off their
always-online<00:05:50.700> DRM<00:05:50.790> after<00:05:51.630> people

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
always-online DRM after people

I I just don't see that happening with

and<00:06:13.190> I<00:06:13.819> also<00:06:14.000> bought<00:06:14.210> it<00:06:14.330> through<00:06:14.449> origin<00:06:14.840> I

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
and I also bought it through origin I

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.600 
and I also bought it through origin I
didn't<00:06:15.110> get<00:06:15.199> it<00:06:15.289> through<00:06:15.500> through<00:06:16.009> Amazon<00:06:16.430> so

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
didn't get it through through Amazon so

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.850 
didn't get it through through Amazon so
that<00:06:16.729> really<00:06:16.940> does<00:06:17.180> suck<00:06:17.479> but<00:06:17.720> it's<00:06:18.560> nothing<00:06:18.800> I

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
that really does suck but it's nothing I

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.830 
that really does suck but it's nothing I
