00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
streams very quickly it's really good

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.229 
streams very quickly it's really good
for<00:00:49.980> things<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.280> champion<00:00:50.730> mechanics<00:00:51.090> or

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
for things like champion mechanics or

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.790 
for things like champion mechanics or
tips<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> tricks<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.230> champion<00:00:52.680> or

tips and tricks with that champion or

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.260 
tips and tricks with that champion or
specific<00:00:53.219> lane<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.910> camera<00:00:54.210> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
specific lane because the camera is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.150 
specific lane because the camera is
always<00:00:54.719> focus<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.649> individual<00:00:56.129> is

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
always focus on them that individual is

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.650 
always focus on them that individual is
playing<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.670> champion<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:57.510> have

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
playing that champion and so they have

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.760 
playing that champion and so they have
to<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.989> camera<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.649> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to have that camera there they have to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.900 
to have that camera there they have to
play<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> lame<00:00:59.250> right<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.670> they'll<00:00:59.789> often

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
play the lame right and they'll often

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.459 
play the lame right and they'll often
commentate<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.629> well<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.140> pick<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
commentate as well so you can pick up a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.869 
commentate as well so you can pick up a
lot<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.739> different<00:01:02.010> things<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> Lane

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
lot of different things for that Lane

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.820

now<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> LCS<00:01:03.960> set<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.379> obviously<00:01:04.739> you

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
now with the LCS set up obviously you

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.050 
now with the LCS set up obviously you
don't<00:01:05.010> look<00:01:05.159> at<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> same<00:01:05.580> line<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
don't look at the same line for the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.460 
don't look at the same line for the
entire<00:01:06.390> game<00:01:06.630> you're<00:01:06.840> looking<00:01:07.080> around<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
entire game you're looking around the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.810 
entire game you're looking around the
map<00:01:07.619> you're<00:01:07.799> seeing<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> map<00:01:08.280> control<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
map you're seeing the map control and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.070 
map you're seeing the map control and
you're<00:01:08.909> seeing<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> different<00:01:09.510> lanes<00:01:09.689> you

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
you're seeing the different lanes you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.450 
you're seeing the different lanes you
can<00:01:10.260> still<00:01:10.470> pick<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.799> couple<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.100> champion

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
can still pick up a couple of champion

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.740 
can still pick up a couple of champion
tips<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.850> tricks<00:01:12.090> obviously<00:01:12.479> when<00:01:12.630> they're

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
tips and tricks obviously when they're

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.330 
tips and tricks obviously when they're
fighting<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.260> camera<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.680> centered<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.189> them

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
fighting the camera is centered on them

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.590 
fighting the camera is centered on them
that<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> don't<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> same<00:01:15.360> kind

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that you don't really get the same kind

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480 
that you don't really get the same kind
of<00:01:15.659> feel<00:01:15.900> orlane<00:01:16.380> pressure<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.340> would

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
of feel orlane pressure that you would

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.429 
of feel orlane pressure that you would
learn<00:01:17.670> from<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.060> reply<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.360> stream<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> main

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
learn from a reply as stream so the main

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.600 
learn from a reply as stream so the main
thing<00:01:19.470> you're<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> improve<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.400> from

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
thing you're going to improve on from

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.920 
thing you're going to improve on from
the<00:01:20.700> LCS<00:01:21.090> stream<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:21.689> going<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> be

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the LCS stream is actually going to be

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.510 
the LCS stream is actually going to be
your<00:01:22.049> knowledge<00:01:22.350> now<00:01:22.740> knowledge<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.250> very

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
your knowledge now knowledge is a very

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.160 
your knowledge now knowledge is a very
broad<00:01:23.790> subject<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.869> break<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
broad subject and I'm going to break it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.510 
broad subject and I'm going to break it
down<00:01:25.290> pretty<00:01:25.530> much<00:01:25.740> into<00:01:25.979> team<00:01:26.220> fighting

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
down pretty much into team fighting

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.850 
down pretty much into team fighting
engagements<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.570> map<00:01:27.689> control<00:01:28.080> these<00:01:28.619> three

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
engagements and map control these three

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.499 
engagements and map control these three
areas<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.280> most<00:01:29.430> easily<00:01:29.640> noticeable<00:01:30.240> on

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
areas that most easily noticeable on

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.539 
areas that most easily noticeable on
streams<00:01:31.020> from<00:01:31.200> team<00:01:31.530> coordination<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.400> it's

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
streams from team coordination and it's

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.980 
streams from team coordination and it's
also<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.909> three<00:01:33.150> areas<00:01:33.540> are<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> like

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
also the three areas are going to like

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.960 
also the three areas are going to like
to<00:01:34.140> carry<00:01:34.350> southwark<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.890> even<00:01:35.220> more<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.850> make

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
to carry southwark you even more to make

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.190 
to carry southwark you even more to make
this<00:01:36.090> easy<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.659> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.110> I'm

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
this easy what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.539 
this easy what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.380> show<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.680> situation<00:01:38.280> from<00:01:38.460> an

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
going to show you a situation from an

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.100 
going to show you a situation from an
LCS<00:01:38.939> game<00:01:39.210> for<00:01:39.540> each<00:01:39.630> three<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.020> these

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
LCS game for each three of these

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.450 
LCS game for each three of these
categories<00:01:40.560> I'm<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> break<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.340> down

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
categories I'm going to break it down

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.920 
categories I'm going to break it down
and<00:01:41.640> tell<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> how<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.360> analyze<00:01:42.750> these

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and tell you how you can analyze these

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.450 
and tell you how you can analyze these
situations<00:01:43.560> while<00:01:43.799> you're<00:01:43.979> watching<00:01:44.130> them

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
situations while you're watching them

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.889 
situations while you're watching them
and<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:44.939> how<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.270> take<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.570> into<00:01:45.810> your

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
and then how you can take that into your

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.359 
and then how you can take that into your
solo<00:01:46.170> q<00:01:46.350> games<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.770> actually<00:01:47.009> apply<00:01:47.310> these

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
solo q games and actually apply these

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.160 
solo q games and actually apply these
mechanics<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:48.659> important<00:01:49.049> thing<00:01:49.079> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
mechanics now one important thing to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.630 
mechanics now one important thing to
note<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.950> these<00:01:50.040> clips<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
note with all of these clips is that

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.039 
note with all of these clips is that
everything<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.060> pro<00:01:51.210> player<00:01:51.240> does<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.020> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
everything a pro player does is for a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.690 
everything a pro player does is for a
reason<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.619> they<00:01:53.040> use<00:01:53.189> their<00:01:53.340> ultimate

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
reason if they use their ultimate

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.770 
reason if they use their ultimate
there's<00:01:53.880> definitely<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.479> reason

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
there's definitely gonna be a reason

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
there's definitely gonna be a reason
behind<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.530> what<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.710> allows<00:01:55.950> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
behind that and so what that allows you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.950 
behind that and so what that allows you
to<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.790> say<00:01:57.060> why<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:57.600> use<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
to do is to say why do they use that

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.420 
to do is to say why do they use that
ultimate<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:59.009> figure<00:01:59.219> out<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
ultimate you can then figure out the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.859 
ultimate you can then figure out the
answer<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.909> question<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.509> then<00:02:00.630> use<00:02:00.840> that

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
answer that question and then use that

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.990 
answer that question and then use that
and<00:02:01.229> take<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.500> into<00:02:01.619> solo<00:02:01.890> q<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.790> clip

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and take it into solo q so in this clip

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.609 
and take it into solo q so in this clip
it's<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> TSM<00:02:03.899> vs.<00:02:04.229> cloud<00:02:04.409> nine

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it's going to be a TSM vs. cloud nine

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.810 
it's going to be a TSM vs. cloud nine
game<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> be<00:02:05.310> about<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.640> time

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
game it's going to be about the time

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.889 
game it's going to be about the time
when<00:02:05.909> they're<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.240> fight<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.570> dragon

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
when they're going to fight for dragon

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.660 
when they're going to fight for dragon
you're<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.530> see<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.740> pic<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.310> thresh

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you're going to see the pic on to thresh

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.919 
you're going to see the pic on to thresh
that's<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.209> from<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.479> sneaky<00:02:09.899> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
that's going to be from a sneaky a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.660 
that's going to be from a sneaky a
shower<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:10.890> not<00:02:11.009> always<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> best<00:02:11.459> idea

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
shower now it's not always the best idea

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
shower now it's not always the best idea
to<00:02:11.940> arrow<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.480> support<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.140> this

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
to arrow the support but in this

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.780 
to arrow the support but in this
they<00:02:13.710> just<00:02:13.860> want<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.070> turn<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.400> fight<00:02:14.580> into<00:02:14.760> a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
they just want to turn the fight into a

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.060 
they just want to turn the fight into a
45<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.660> they<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.930> take<00:02:16.080> dragon<00:02:16.530> now<00:02:16.860> I'm<00:02:16.920> going

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
45 so they can take dragon now I'm going

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.200 
45 so they can take dragon now I'm going
to<00:02:17.130> pause<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.310> right<00:02:17.520> here<00:02:17.760> because<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.120> is

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
to pause it right here because this is

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.180 
to pause it right here because this is
when<00:02:18.360> TSM<00:02:18.810> decides<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.320> fight<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:19.830> v5<00:02:20.160> and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
when TSM decides to fight for v5 and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.470 
when TSM decides to fight for v5 and
it's<00:02:20.490> definitely<00:02:20.790> going<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.940> be<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> reason<00:02:21.450> why

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
it's definitely going to be a reason why

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.760 
it's definitely going to be a reason why
they<00:02:21.870> did<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.380> I'm<00:02:22.470> just<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.710> to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
they did that so I'm just going to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.740 
they did that so I'm just going to
explain<00:02:23.100> what<00:02:23.310> their<00:02:23.490> reasoning<00:02:23.790> was<00:02:24.210> now<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
explain what their reasoning was now the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.030 
explain what their reasoning was now the
first<00:02:24.900> thing<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.230> notice<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.530> lamination

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
first thing to notice that lamination

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.890 
first thing to notice that lamination
has<00:02:26.190> no<00:02:26.370> mana<00:02:26.610> he<00:02:26.880> has<00:02:26.970> manna<00:02:27.210> for<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.450> grass-

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
has no mana he has manna for a grass-

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900 
has no mana he has manna for a grass-
always<00:02:28.500> ultimately<00:02:28.800> doesn't<00:02:29.250> have<00:02:29.460> romo<00:02:29.700> for

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
always ultimately doesn't have romo for

teasing get baited a little bit here

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.360 
teasing get baited a little bit here
because<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.780> don't<00:02:42.960> consider<00:02:43.260> as<00:02:43.440> passive<00:02:43.890> so

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
because I don't consider as passive so

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.890 
because I don't consider as passive so
those<00:02:44.520> two<00:02:44.730> reasons<00:02:45.030> going<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.240> be<00:02:45.300> why<00:02:45.480> TSM

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
those two reasons going to be why TSM

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.330 
those two reasons going to be why TSM
engaged<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.560> even<00:02:46.800> though<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.010> seems<00:02:47.190> like

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
engaged and even though it seems like

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.130 
engaged and even though it seems like
TSM<00:02:47.700> lost<00:02:47.940> his<00:02:48.150> fight<00:02:48.330> they<00:02:48.510> actually<00:02:48.750> went<00:02:48.870> 4

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
TSM lost his fight they actually went 4

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.660 
TSM lost his fight they actually went 4
for<00:02:49.290> 4<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.709> they<00:02:49.830> stopped<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.040> dragon<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.550> is

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
for 4 and they stopped the dragon so is

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.090 
for 4 and they stopped the dragon so is
well<00:02:50.910> worth<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.690> good<00:02:51.870> call<00:02:52.080> by<00:02:52.140> TSM<00:02:52.770> so

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
well worth it and a good call by TSM so

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.590

5 so i'll give you that for free now I

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.890 
5 so i'll give you that for free now I
did<00:03:08.820> say<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.000> team<00:03:09.240> fighting<00:03:09.480> was<00:03:09.690> one<00:03:09.840> of

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
did say that team fighting was one of

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.090 
did say that team fighting was one of
the<00:03:09.959> categories<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.560> can<00:03:10.680> learn<00:03:10.860> from

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
the categories that you can learn from

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.380 
the categories that you can learn from
but<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> only<00:03:11.580> way<00:03:11.730> you're<00:03:11.880> going<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.060> do<00:03:12.240> that

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
but the only way you're going to do that

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.000 
but the only way you're going to do that
because<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:12.930> hectic<00:03:13.110> as<00:03:13.410> if<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.590> focus

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
because it's so hectic as if you focus

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.130 
because it's so hectic as if you focus
on<00:03:14.160> one<00:03:14.370> champion<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.570> really<00:03:15.900> good

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
on one champion and this is really good

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.570 
on one champion and this is really good
for<00:03:16.320> learning<00:03:16.470> how<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.770> champion<00:03:17.190> works<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.519> a

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
for learning how the champion works in a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.979 
for learning how the champion works in a
teamfight<00:03:17.820> obviously<00:03:18.390> these<00:03:18.510> players<00:03:18.840> are

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
teamfight obviously these players are

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.720 
teamfight obviously these players are
mechanically<00:03:19.530> fantastic<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:20.489> they're<00:03:20.610> going

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
mechanically fantastic so they're going

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.860 
mechanically fantastic so they're going
to<00:03:20.820> play<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.060> teamfight<00:03:21.269> pretty<00:03:21.690> much

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
to play the teamfight pretty much

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.360 
to play the teamfight pretty much
perfectly<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.680> give<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:22.950> really<00:03:23.220> good

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
perfectly and give you a really good

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.190 
perfectly and give you a really good
thing<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.610> aim<00:03:23.850> for<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.660> see<00:03:24.810> at<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:24.959> start

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
thing to aim for so you see at the start

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.479 
thing to aim for so you see at the start
of<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.320> fight<00:03:25.500> balls<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:26.010> absolutely

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
of the fight balls it absolutely

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.009 
of the fight balls it absolutely
explodes<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.209> lease<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.600> this<00:03:27.690> pretty<00:03:27.870> much

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
explodes a lease and this pretty much

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.560 
explodes a lease and this pretty much
turns<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.350> 45<00:03:28.920> into<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> 3v<00:03:29.760> 5<00:03:29.970> because<00:03:30.269> he<00:03:30.360> killed

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
turns a 45 into a 3v 5 because he killed

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.810 
turns a 45 into a 3v 5 because he killed
him<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:30.870> fast<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.680> next<00:03:31.950> priority<00:03:32.130> target<00:03:32.640> for

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
him so fast the next priority target for

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.949 
him so fast the next priority target for
him<00:03:32.970> is<00:03:33.060> going<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.269> be<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.390> closest<00:03:33.780> thing

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
him is going to be the closest thing

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.720 
him is going to be the closest thing
because<00:03:34.260> rises<00:03:34.650> very<00:03:34.860> short<00:03:35.220> range<00:03:35.459> that's

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
because rises very short range that's

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.670 
because rises very short range that's
going<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:35.970> be<00:03:36.060> dyrus<00:03:36.510> on<00:03:36.690> renekton<00:03:37.260> now<00:03:37.560> as

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
going to be dyrus on renekton now as

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.320 
going to be dyrus on renekton now as
soon<00:03:37.830> as<00:03:37.980> Doris<00:03:38.280> actually<00:03:38.519> turns<00:03:38.790> onto<00:03:39.030> Bulls

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
soon as Doris actually turns onto Bulls

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.790 
soon as Doris actually turns onto Bulls
he's<00:03:39.510> pretty<00:03:39.750> squishy<00:03:39.989> at<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:40.320> point<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.709> you

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
times so I personally think that sk

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.800 
times so I personally think that sk
telecom<00:05:43.400> t1<00:05:43.430> are<00:05:43.969> probably<00:05:44.210> going<00:05:44.360> to<00:05:44.449> win<00:05:44.630> the

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
telecom t1 are probably going to win the

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.510 
telecom t1 are probably going to win the
whole<00:05:44.990> thing<00:05:45.020> because<00:05:45.740> individually<00:05:46.370> they're

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
whole thing because individually they're

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.129 
whole thing because individually they're
all<00:05:46.639> incredible<00:05:47.150> mechanical<00:05:47.330> players<00:05:47.930> and

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
all incredible mechanical players and

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.120 
all incredible mechanical players and
that's<00:05:48.259> really<00:05:48.469> what<00:05:48.620> you<00:05:48.680> need<00:05:48.770> with

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
that's really what you need with

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.680 
that's really what you need with
coordination<00:05:49.639> to<00:05:49.969> win<00:05:50.180> but<00:05:50.449> the<00:05:50.569> really

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
coordination to win but the really

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.330 
coordination to win but the really
exciting<00:05:51.050> thing<00:05:51.289> for<00:05:51.319> me<00:05:51.469> and<00:05:51.770> well<00:05:51.949> does<00:05:52.190> that

actually any team has a possibility of
winning<00:05:54.080> all<00:05:54.650> of<00:05:54.710> these<00:05:55.039> teams<00:05:55.279> are<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.669> best
