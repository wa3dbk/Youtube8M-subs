00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.040
 hair 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.500
 we already reminded his coach 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.940
 four vitamin a vitamin b2 b5 b6 and myths 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.520
 3-0 do it 5 10th 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.730
 two amino acids methionine 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.930
 and his cousin 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.620
 assist 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.310
 what is it used for 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.130
 to feed them of course to allow a harmonious development 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.049
 after ten years long hair abundant and bright 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.040
 and slowed down the recording and their downfall 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.400
 premature 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.400
 we will now see 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.660
 when a very big these different mastering we will start with the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.600
 group of vitamins b and so the bay of peace it's a bit like it's 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.580
 the peace 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.720
 their main role is to participate in the production of energy 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.560
 and protein synthesis 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.800
 necessary for the apple grows hair 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.310
 they are mainly found in cereals wheat germ cocoa 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.299
 but also in dread and oil seeds 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.299
 pau vitamin b2 and for ticketing 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.970
 they are widespread in nature it is difficult for an individual 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.079
 healthy belly deficiency 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.659
 the six numbers of the hair firstly do it 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.810
 essentially present in hemoglobin it is quite 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.609
 naturally in the meats the offal its role is to oxygenate all the 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:07.220
 tissues 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.129
 in the hair 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.980
 and iron deficiency will translate it is certainly not a fall from 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.639
 hair 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.959
 in the current diet do it also present here again in the 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:16.870
 cocoa 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.379
 and cereal products 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.379
 it also opens in significant quantity 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.039
 in the role it results 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.249
 a unique contribution 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.199
 in its vegetal form 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.289
 will lead to a deficiency

 frequently seen in vegans 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.690
 because in this form it is clearly less well absorbed 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.389
 than in its animal form 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.229
 hence the importance of vitamin C kita promotes the absorption of iron 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.680
 consumption of foods rich in vitamin C 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.519

 to extinguish small fire triggered by free radicals 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.589
 true sin and cell life that lead to 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:16.859
 Premature aging of the hair 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.370
 the most zinc-rich foods without oysters and the majority of

 enriched cereals 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.439

 a little near oslo 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.769
 now let's see the sulfur amino acids 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.509
 sulfur amino acids 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.419
 and first and foremost on sale leader 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.999
 methionine 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:07.259
 methionine and his cousin six countries is part of the composition of the 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.719
 keratin that is there hair protein 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:14.850
 with the lot it is necessary not to forget the water it is necessary to not forget the water in the hair 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.340
 water and fatty acids the methionine is the artist plays an important role 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.949
 for him to be and p 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.379
 and briand

 and fork 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:35.349
 only methionine is an essential amino acid a kind of vitamins 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.199
 which must be brought by the diet 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.029
 cysteine ​​l can be synthesized from methionine 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:44.080
 but this synthesis 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.610
 when vitamin B6 sounds to the detriment of good health 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.559
 hair 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.400
 it has been demonstrated experimentally 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.600
 it's a balanced dietary intake of methionine six countries 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.819
 dropping this synthesis by 60% 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:04:59.810
 and your 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.020
 and appears both from the decade 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.720
 and vitamin b6 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.400
 for the well-being of the hair 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.870
 nature is thrifty
