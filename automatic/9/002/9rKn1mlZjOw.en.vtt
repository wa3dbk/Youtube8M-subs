of<00:02:46.620> rage<00:02:46.769> down<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.129> think<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:48.739> little<00:02:49.739> rage<00:02:49.980> that

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
of rage down I think a little rage that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.600 
of rage down I think a little rage that
can<00:02:50.340> go<00:02:50.489> into<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.909> rage<00:02:52.129> zapping<00:02:53.129> now<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.459> to

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
can go into the rage zapping now on to

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.339 
can go into the rage zapping now on to
that<00:02:53.760> air<00:02:54.329> defense<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:56.180> just<00:02:57.180> wiping<00:02:58.140> out

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
that air defense and just wiping out

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.330 
that air defense and just wiping out
that<00:02:59.569> that<00:03:00.569> town<00:03:00.870> hall<00:03:01.109> there<00:03:01.290> another<00:03:01.890> rage<00:03:02.160> I

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
that that town hall there another rage I

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.300 
that that town hall there another rage I
think<00:03:02.519> I'll<00:03:02.640> do<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.680> can<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.769> see<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.069> power

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
think I'll do it can you see the power

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.369 
think I'll do it can you see the power
of<00:03:05.579> this<00:03:05.700> strategy<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.420> think<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.109> is<00:03:07.170> going

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
of this strategy I think this is going

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.839 
of this strategy I think this is going
to<00:03:07.470> revolutionize<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.549> see<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:08.760> being

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
to revolutionize it I can see this being

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.390 
to revolutionize it I can see this being
all<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.690> top<00:03:09.900> players<00:03:10.079> using<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.129> this
