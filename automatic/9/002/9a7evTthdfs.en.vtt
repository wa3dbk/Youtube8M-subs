00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.910
 the south 500 families live desperate 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.270
 next to another car cemetery and 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.270
 motorcycles

 in the south of the city ​​another green area 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.990
 went from being a lung to many of the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.750
 neighbors to become a cemetery 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.970
 where the boss in the scrap and that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.220
 has been affecting the environment for several years 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.660
 environment this area was some 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.260
 donation some green areas in another 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.690
 we are trying to recover it like this 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.239
 of party blend get the possibility of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.440
 get in children's games the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.870
 inhabitants of the residential complex 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.640
 alborada has a parking lot that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.890
 first sight could happen as something 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.660
 normal but that as you start 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.550
 to walk begins to show the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.350
 abandonment and especially the state of 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.300
 destruction of motor vehicles that have 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.660
 been parked on this site and that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.249
 they remain so polluting the environment 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.960
 in the middle of buses and steamships 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.149
 there are particular vehicles that 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.350
 reflect the passage of time with rust 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.540
 his pieces became this loaning 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.240
 an individual with the secretariat of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.470
 municipal transit and is the transit 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.830
 municipal is the one that administers this 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.850
 parking but 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.080
 the owner Mr. Gustavo Sanz is even 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.400
 in this park there are now buses of mine 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.810
 parked 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.760
 there are also ambulances in the middle of the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.610
 weeds and what abounds most are 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.440
 motorcycles of all cylinders is 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.990
 more you can observe a mountain of 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.350
 are mixed with bicycles a 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.150
 truly dantesque panorama even 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.190
 there are buses that show loss by 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.420
 conflagrations and intermingle with 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.420
 all types of bodies 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.300
 and here comes almost 60 is generated by 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.100
 hundred of what is next is all 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.630
 the mobilized charges come to give here 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.330
 in this part all those that are made in 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.210
 the southern part comes to give here to this 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.600
 parking obviously as you 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.370
 you will understand that you do not bring great 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.350
 prejudice especially to all 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.080
 apartments that are adjacent adjacent 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.270
 to the parking lot the inhabitants of this 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.040
 unit and others are adjacent breezes 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.560
 leonard have tried to be 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.210
 solve this problem but so 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.700
 as it happens with the neighbors of santa 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.680
 barbara is not the solution 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.300
 previous administrations have sent 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.790
 officiated the government secretary not 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.990
 long ago in March this 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.430
 year in the one of a statement to the transit 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.020
 to people in the government area 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.640
 they answered that I was such an evil 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.410
 he said it was the government and government and 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.540
 although the transit in this case is more 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.459
 dramatic the situation then the entrance 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.290
 of vehicles by different factors to 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.380
 this air park does not have a schedule 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.880
 noise 34 in the morning entering vehicles 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.560
 all you can imagine the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.630
 magnitude of the problem we have in that 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.760
 moment and they have also been 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.819
 depreciated the apartments 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.069
 Well, when I 'm well in Vienna, compare 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.410
 forever 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.600
 in the inconvenience 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.940
 of this parking lot because sin does not 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.560
 is presenting notoriously what 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.840
 paradoxical of this story is that the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.820
 400 families of this residential unit 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.160
 they only have this little park 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.290
 for fun and entertainment 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.550
 the children while next there is an area 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.590
 much bigger turned into 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.880
 cemetery of cars and cars and for 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.160
 complete according to comparison 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.140
 municipal park that corresponded 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.360
 this unit is located I hope behind 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.650
 from a shopping center 15 minutes away 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.650
 car of the same unit
