00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.620
 Hello cell number 11 and today we will 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.310
 see if we really need to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.039
 programs and tools for an invasion 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:23.369
 a hacker does not need tools 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.310
 the program to hack a hacker is 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.210
 able to hack using only the mind 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.929
 radio 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.420
 it is clear that in more complex reasons 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.110
 need more elaborate processes 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.780
 using specific programs but there are 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.170
 various ways to hack using methods 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.879
 hackers added as mind radio 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.320
 sometimes it is easier to see where 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.559
 the key of what to work to open 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.559
 the door 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:05.710
 the attention 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:10.630
 combined with buried in a way 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:14.260
 hack yes use tools or 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.940
 programs a way of hacking without this 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.300
 use of tools 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.600
 we can cite the example of observing 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.240
 someone enter a password when going 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.090
 open the e-mail observe the password and 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.500
 memorize it you just rock soul 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.260
 feels half 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.060
 This is because why you used it 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.720
 again radio 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.840
 this is trying with a hacker and that's how it is 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.830
 that you will start to think from 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.000
 from now 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.710
 This proves the effectiveness of this technique because 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.570
 just looking 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.420
 you were able to hack a series of 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.610
 emails without using a tool without the use 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:03.429
 of program and master or even of a 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:08.410
 computer attention added with agility 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:11.200
 summed up with a rakia mind another way 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.580
 to think like a hacker and get data 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.910
 stealthy 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.810
 imagine that you are at work and your 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.320
 boss 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.260
 decides to leave and leaves the computer there 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.980
 unprotected you quickly and 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.970
 goes to his desk and has access to all 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.760
 your data 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.319
 you have access to the computer you have 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.000
 access to your data 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.190
 You can open a drawer and find 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.750
 identity find the number of cpf 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.960
 you can look at the bin and find a 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.650
 bank statement with your account data 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.590
 so now notice the number of data 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.850
 that you discovered just thinking like 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.980
 a hacker this year has cpf identity and 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.670
 bank account number 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.480
 computer data, this is a way of 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.190
 to hack extremely efficiently and you 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.640
 who can not be a victim 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.250
 can not suffer this attack so the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:23.960
 your things should always be in place 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:25.880
 where only you have access in 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.320
 social engineering 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.240
 We've already had a class on this and it's 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.490
 another way of hacking without tools 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.980
 social engineering consists of a 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.710
 hacker technique used to obtain 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.920
 access to important information by 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.520
 means of illusion and exploitation in trust 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.250
 of people then social engineering 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.560
 with the power of persuasion you will not 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.940
 need to use a program with the invasion 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.550
 you will use your gift of persuasion will 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.830
 using rhetoric will use the exploitation of 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.280
 confidence that people will have 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.540
 What are you going to say? 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.540
 This is the end of class.
