 we seek to receive the animals 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.789
 that are abandoned on the streets, not to give 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.039

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.090
 having a family and then being reinserted 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.100
 in society that the chance to have a side 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.260
 I noticed that everything is fine 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.200

 every day the staff arrives we have 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.509
 employees on a payroll schedule right 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.000

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.180
 I'll get sick and I'll be there until 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.250

 castration after this song cross zoom 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.509
 cane and agents and for the kennels of 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.739
 according to the behavior of each 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.739
 personality of each dog 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.700
 we are looking to aggregate the animals of 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.650
 according to their profile and when the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.430
 person comes to adopt us presents 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.069
 animal 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.209
 that individual that the person expects 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.950
 meet 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.769
 though many people come here to 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.940
 adopt a puppy wanting this joke 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.910
 to find the puppy easier 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.430
 It's easier to teach but it's the 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.260
 people have a profile traced from adults 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.540
 so people who want to adopt 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.819
 can choose the puppy to do 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.110
 too much of a mess to be a terrorist at home or 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.269
 an adult she already knows how to deal with 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.799
 recommends watching TV more 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.319
 Calm down, we can calm down. 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.329

 we go when the person arrives 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.099
 People are chatting who the animal is. 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.680
 that the person would like to have 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.790
 company and anyone can 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.230

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.849
 animals in the house there in this interview 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.260
 people guide which animal would be 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.410

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.060
