00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
what's-his-name cypher from the matrix

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.330 
what's-his-name cypher from the matrix
having<00:03:27.930> picked<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.590> wrong<00:03:28.770> pill<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.190> he's

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
having picked the wrong pill and he's

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.700 
having picked the wrong pill and he's
mad<00:03:29.760> at<00:03:29.940> everyone<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.330> going<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.570> go<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.900> exact

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
mad at everyone is going to go and exact

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.040 
mad at everyone is going to go and exact
revenge<00:03:32.070> by<00:03:32.880> blinking<00:03:33.450> them<00:03:33.570> back<00:03:33.810> into<00:03:33.960> the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
revenge by blinking them back into the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.320 
revenge by blinking them back into the
matrix<00:03:34.170> but<00:03:34.560> I'll<00:03:34.680> know<00:03:34.830> what<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.340> equivalent

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
matrix but I'll know what the equivalent

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.800 
matrix but I'll know what the equivalent
matrix<00:03:36.960> is<00:03:37.170> in<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:38.400> scenario<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.450> I'm<00:03:39.630> just

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
matrix is in this scenario so I'm just

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.930 
matrix is in this scenario so I'm just
gonna<00:03:40.260> speak<00:03:40.620> in<00:03:40.830> sentences<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.520> end

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
gonna speak in sentences that end

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.930 
gonna speak in sentences that end
abruptly<00:03:42.330> like<00:03:43.110> this<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.740> yeah<00:03:44.490> so<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
abruptly like this and yeah so the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.720 
abruptly like this and yeah so the
basically<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:46.130> just<00:03:47.130> can't<00:03:47.310> wait<00:03:47.430> for<00:03:47.459> summer

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
basically I I just can't wait for summer

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.180 
basically I I just can't wait for summer
I<00:03:48.000> wonder<00:03:48.720> if<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.050> guys<00:03:49.230> feel<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:49.980> same

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
I wonder if you guys feel the same

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.620 
I wonder if you guys feel the same
probably<00:03:50.610> do<00:03:50.700> because<00:03:50.970> school<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.420> really

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
probably do because school is really
