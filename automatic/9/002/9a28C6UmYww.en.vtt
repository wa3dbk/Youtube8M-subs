00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.580
 notebook he is a model at 560 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.170
 I'm bringing his boxing so that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.420
 you can see the contents of the box 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.519
 to help when choosing the right 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.390
 more product for those who do not know me 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.130
 soltour I come back here trying to do 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.940
 the explanation given the contents of the box 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.620
 a very simple and objective form of self 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.110
 I'll start by just talking about some aspects. 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.469
 of the notebook that it contains 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.219
 i7 core processor read a card 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:48.840
 video geforce gt 640 full screen hd de 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.870
 15.6 inch 3d passive technology 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.210
 The memory lg but I'm not mistaken sound 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.050
 of the richman batuque he has in an HD 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.609
 of 500gb and its top notebook of linda and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.559
 not the best that we can 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.960
 find in the market but it is a notebook 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.640
 high performance and even gives to send 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.240
 some games for those who enjoy games and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.090
 Everything else so I bought more thinking 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.130
 no games like this I want a place 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 traveled something also make the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.439
 video editing on your notebook affected 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 enough then that was a box of 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.580
 bonbon party though she is 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.740
 starting here from the box in the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.680
 front of the box is pretty basic even 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.060
 Personal lg logo showing that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.799
 3d notebook on skewer there lg notebook 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:47.750
 so I'm showing the bottom 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:56.310

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:57.290
 model as he had already said he had to 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.350

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.360
 the other side is quite normal 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.270
 You must apologize to the guys that I am. 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.280
 the other side also has a certain number 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:16.230
 The things that I apologize for is that today I 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.230
