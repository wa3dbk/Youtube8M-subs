00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.829

 they will not be able to stop trying 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.420
 solidarity forces the ingredients here 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.730
 I'm going to remind him of sweet cream cheese 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.879
 of pastry milk and cookies 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.890
 Sober to start the recipe 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.540
 we need a loop to do what it 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.729
 speak very loudly because we are going to have 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.000
 to beat with great force as it would be 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.219
 first the cream cheese how much 750 grams 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.860
 of cream cheese and dulce de leche 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.960
 confectioner the same amount that easy 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.000
 it's from this recipe and we have to beat 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.220
 very much very strongly 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.640
 energetic and you mix these very well 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.610
 two ingredients 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.170
 and now we beat it very very very strong 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.270
 these two ingredients because it costs 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.930
 it costs to integrate them but it is worth 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.930
 and that can be 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.110
 the next step as swallow is removed 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.010
 they are delicious they are not so 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.869
 spectacular 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.940
 we just mixed the two ingredients 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.549
 cream cheese and pse de leche 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.250
 confectioner now put together this cake that 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.409
 let's use a medium- sized pyrex 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.479
 it's not too big to avoid and now we're going to 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.659
 start to put all the cookie solio 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.970
 at the base of this cake so one by one 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.710
 a cookie next to the other this the 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.720
 truth is very entertaining to do 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.549
 among many if you know that they move you 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.490
 you can put a layer of the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.890
 stuffing down so it's easier for you 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.600
 And just a little bit to finish the recipe 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.369
 we already have the cookies in our 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.590

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.610

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.220

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.440

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.460

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.640
