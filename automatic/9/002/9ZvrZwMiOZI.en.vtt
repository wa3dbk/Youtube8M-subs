00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
preconceptions of what that guitar

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.000 
preconceptions of what that guitar
should<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.989> what<00:00:57.989> would<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.590> would<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.859> make

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
should be what would what would we make

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.889 
should be what would what would we make
what<00:00:59.699> would<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.910> thing<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.660> would<00:01:00.750> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
what would that thing be what would it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.110 
what would that thing be what would it
do<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.469> would<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.710> sound<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:03.090> I

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
do what would it sound like so I

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.969 
do what would it sound like so I
literally<00:01:03.510> started<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> blank<00:01:04.500> sheet<00:01:04.589> on

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
literally started with a blank sheet on

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.279 
literally started with a blank sheet on
my<00:01:05.129> drawing<00:01:05.339> board<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:06.110> drew<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
my drawing board and drew out the

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:08.810 
my drawing board and drew out the
dimensions<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:08.009> what<00:01:08.190> I<00:01:08.220> thought<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.640> should

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
dimensions of what I thought it should

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.029 
dimensions of what I thought it should
be<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.539> kept<00:01:09.750> sketching<00:01:10.229> curves<00:01:10.530> until<00:01:11.009> I

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
be and kept sketching curves until I

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:12.980 
be and kept sketching curves until I
knew<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.850> turned<00:01:12.030> into<00:01:12.210> something<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.690> knew<00:01:12.840> was

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
knew it turned into something I knew was

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.719 
knew it turned into something I knew was
going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.259> sound<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.770> based<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.429> the<00:01:14.580> shape

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
going to sound good based on the shape

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.330 
going to sound good based on the shape
alone<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:16.020> combined<00:01:16.410> a<00:01:16.679> lot<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.250> new

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
alone and then combined a lot of new

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.490 
alone and then combined a lot of new
bracing<00:01:17.789> ideas<00:01:18.179> and<00:01:18.570> some<00:01:18.720> new<00:01:18.840> construction

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
bracing ideas and some new construction

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.200 
bracing ideas and some new construction
methods<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.070> things<00:01:20.280> some<00:01:20.759> different

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
methods and things some different

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.899 
methods and things some different
concepts<00:01:21.660> that<00:01:21.840> I'd<00:01:21.990> been<00:01:22.200> toying<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.790> we

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
concepts that I'd been toying with so we

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.090 
concepts that I'd been toying with so we
combined<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.420> into<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.780> new<00:01:24.990> guitar<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
combined it into this new guitar that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.510 
combined it into this new guitar that
has<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.549> huge<00:01:27.150> powerful<00:01:27.950> personality<00:01:28.950> that's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
also really responsive to a light touch

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.719

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
mentioned a second ago oh this basically

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.660 
mentioned a second ago oh this basically
what<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> was<00:01:42.570> after<00:01:42.750> was<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.500> wanted<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.250> make

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
what I was after was I wanted to make

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.460 
what I was after was I wanted to make
the<00:01:44.820> top<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> back<00:01:45.450> work<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> speaker

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the top in the back work like a speaker

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.770 
the top in the back work like a speaker
cone<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.920> wanted<00:01:47.520> them<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.969> be<00:01:48.240> set<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.600> motion

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
cone I wanted them to be set in motion

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.319 
cone I wanted them to be set in motion
really<00:01:49.590> quickly<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.340> easily<00:01:50.820> with<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
really quickly really easily with a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.469 
really quickly really easily with a
minimum<00:01:51.719> of<00:01:51.869> effort<00:01:52.100> so<00:01:53.100> instead<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.790> going

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
minimum of effort so instead of going

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.840 
minimum of effort so instead of going
with<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> traditional<00:01:55.380> scallop<00:01:56.250> bracing<00:01:56.729> or

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
with a traditional scallop bracing or

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.459 
with a traditional scallop bracing or
something<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.360> about<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.079> devise

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
something like that about I devise

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.709 
something like that about I devise
something<00:01:58.829> new<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.549> more<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
something new that's more of like a

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.469 
something new that's more of like a
combination<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.649> parabolic<00:02:02.070> bracing<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.939> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
combination of a parabolic bracing and a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.709 
combination of a parabolic bracing and a
scallop<00:02:03.899> bracing<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.250> I've<00:02:05.850> eliminated<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.689> lot

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
scallop bracing so I've eliminated a lot

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.930 
scallop bracing so I've eliminated a lot
of<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:07.469> stiff<00:02:07.710> spots<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.399> unusual

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
of this little stiff spots the unusual

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.759 
of this little stiff spots the unusual
distortions<00:02:09.630> that<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.869> top<00:02:10.170> might<00:02:10.440> develop

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
distortions that a top might develop

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.460 
distortions that a top might develop
over<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.090> large<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.630> span<00:02:12.900> over<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> big

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
over this large of a span over a big

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
the weight which further allows it to be

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.330 
the weight which further allows it to be
