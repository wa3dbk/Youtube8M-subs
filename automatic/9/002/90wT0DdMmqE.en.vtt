member of focal but the bomb is in the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.459 
member of focal but the bomb is in the
hands<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.239> k<00:00:54.449> style<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.289> actually

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
hands of k style and they are actually

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.069 
hands of k style and they are actually
playing<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.949> very<00:00:56.219> passively<00:00:56.840> it's<00:00:57.840> always

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
playing this very passively it's always

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.110 
playing this very passively it's always
a<00:00:58.199> good<00:00:58.379> idea<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.609> first<00:00:59.850> pic

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
a good idea if you do get that first pic

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.330 
a good idea if you do get that first pic
at<00:01:00.300> playing<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> very<00:01:00.899> safe<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.710> focal<00:01:02.219> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
at playing it very safe as focal is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
at playing it very safe as focal is
doing<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.760> sometimes<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.629> better<00:01:03.809> strategy

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
doing is sometimes a better strategy

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.830 
doing is sometimes a better strategy
because<00:01:04.799> you'll<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> defense<00:01:06.030> respond

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
because you'll see the defense respond

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.990 
because you'll see the defense respond
quickly<00:01:07.140> spread<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.310> defense<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> make

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
quickly spread out that defense and make

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.179 
quickly spread out that defense and make
it<00:01:09.119> easier<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.930> offense<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.560> take<00:01:10.890> over

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
it easier on the offense to take over

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.160 
it easier on the offense to take over
any<00:01:11.340> bomb<00:01:11.580> site<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.659> two<00:01:12.840> members<00:01:13.110> of
