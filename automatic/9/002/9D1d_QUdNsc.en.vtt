00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.800 

so<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:01.860> went<00:00:02.070> over<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.280> mix<00:00:02.580> ammo<00:00:02.879> and<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:03.629> got

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
so I went over to mix ammo and I got

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.140 
so I went over to mix ammo and I got
some<00:00:04.140> characters<00:00:04.920> in<00:00:05.870> some<00:00:06.870> oceans<00:00:08.000> and<00:00:09.000> I

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
some characters in some oceans and I

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
some characters in some oceans and I
prepared<00:00:09.990> them<00:00:10.200> for<00:00:10.670> instancing<00:00:11.670> by<00:00:12.170> making

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
prepared them for instancing by making

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.880 
prepared them for instancing by making
sure<00:00:13.200> their<00:00:13.590> pivots<00:00:13.980> were<00:00:14.190> at<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.730> origin<00:00:15.179> and

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
sure their pivots were at the origin and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.210 
sure their pivots were at the origin and
they're<00:00:16.890> all<00:00:17.070> facing<00:00:17.340> down<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.350> x-axis<00:00:19.350> and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
they're all facing down the x-axis and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.730 
they're all facing down the x-axis and
their<00:00:20.880> transmission<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.900> translations<00:00:22.590> are

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
their transmission the translations are

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.890 
their transmission the translations are
frozen<00:00:23.039> they're<00:00:23.609> grouped<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.150> named<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.869> I

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
frozen they're grouped and named so I

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.500 
frozen they're grouped and named so I
can<00:00:25.199> find<00:00:25.500> them<00:00:25.650> easily<00:00:26.580> later<00:00:29.179> before<00:00:30.179> we

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
can find them easily later before we

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.650 
can find them easily later before we
instance<00:00:30.960> them<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.560> our<00:00:32.460> particles<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.420> want<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
instance them to our particles I want to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.290 
instance them to our particles I want to
talk<00:00:33.870> about<00:00:34.079> seeding<00:00:35.690> which<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
talk about seeding which is going to

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.670 
talk about seeding which is going to
make<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> recreate<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> little<00:00:40.200> simulation

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
make a recreate a little simulation

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.500 
make a recreate a little simulation
which<00:00:41.690> we<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.899> use<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.290> our<00:00:43.350> advantage<00:00:43.489> by<00:00:44.510> say

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
which we can use to our advantage by say

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.010 
which we can use to our advantage by say
1<00:00:46.140> characters<00:00:46.980> acting<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.760> weird<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.809> can

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
1 characters acting just weird we can

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.910 
1 characters acting just weird we can
turn<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:50.539> lifespan<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.960> zero<00:00:52.230> or<00:00:52.440> basically

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
turn that lifespan to zero or basically

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
turn that lifespan to zero or basically
kill<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.280> before<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.820> ever<00:00:53.940> born<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.510> we

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
kill it before it's ever born so we

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.779 
kill it before it's ever born so we
don't<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> worry<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:56.670> we

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
don't have to worry about it so if we

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.479 
don't have to worry about it so if we
get<00:00:57.000> our<00:00:57.239> expression<00:00:58.109> editor<00:00:58.350> out<00:01:01.340> you<00:01:02.340> know

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
get our expression editor out you know

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.490 
get our expression editor out you know
creation<00:01:03.149> expression<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.290> write

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
creation expression we can just write

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:16.370 
creation expression we can just write
seed<00:01:05.900> ID<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:11.040> turn<00:01:11.760> into<00:01:12.200> numeric<00:01:15.380> our

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
seed ID and if we turn into numeric our

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.760 
seed ID and if we turn into numeric our
ID<00:01:16.680> will<00:01:17.130> show<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:18.530> when<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.680> hit<00:01:19.830> play

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.999 

you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:25.079> over<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.679> the<00:01:25.770> left

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
you can see like over here on the left

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.690 
you can see like over here on the left
is<00:01:26.729> particle<00:01:27.420> ID<00:01:28.259> number<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:29.630> rewind<00:01:31.700> there

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
is particle ID number for rewind there

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.670 
is particle ID number for rewind there
it<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.909> again<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:35.070> there's<00:01:35.280> 12

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.770 

and<00:01:40.130> there's<00:01:40.340> four<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:40.790> twelve<00:01:41.030> again<00:01:41.300> so<00:01:41.570> say

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
and there's four and twelve again so say

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.690 
and there's four and twelve again so say
we<00:01:41.870> didn't<00:01:42.110> like<00:01:42.440> what<00:01:42.680> twelve<00:01:42.980> was<00:01:43.130> doing<00:01:43.460> we

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
we didn't like what twelve was doing we

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.580 
we didn't like what twelve was doing we
can<00:01:43.850> just<00:01:44.030> set<00:01:44.210> its<00:01:44.360> lifespan<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:45.110> zero<00:01:45.380> and

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
can just set its lifespan to zero and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.630 
can just set its lifespan to zero and
not<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.980> worry<00:01:46.160> about<00:01:46.220> it

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.000 

if<00:01:50.510> we<00:01:50.780> play<00:01:51.020> here<00:01:51.260> a<00:01:51.290> little<00:01:51.560> long<00:01:51.710> here<00:01:51.740> we'll

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
if we play here a little long here we'll

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.270 
if we play here a little long here we'll
notice<00:01:52.040> we<00:01:52.460> get<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:53.920> recognizable<00:01:54.920> pattern

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
notice we get a recognizable pattern

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.200 
notice we get a recognizable pattern
that<00:01:55.460> kind<00:01:55.670> of<00:01:56.710> striping<00:01:57.710> down<00:01:57.920> like<00:01:58.190> that<00:01:58.430> in

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
that kind of striping down like that in

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.370 
that kind of striping down like that in
your<00:01:59.450> expression<00:02:00.760> you<00:02:01.760> can<00:02:02.000> just<00:02:02.330> multiply<00:02:02.660> or

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
your expression you can just multiply or

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.100 
your expression you can just multiply or
add<00:02:03.560> some<00:02:04.280> values<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:05.000> until<00:02:05.900> you<00:02:06.020> get

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
add some values to it until you get

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.960 
add some values to it until you get
something<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.560> like<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.550> I'm<00:02:07.640> just<00:02:07.760> going<00:02:07.910> to

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
something you like so I'm just going to

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.190 
something you like so I'm just going to
multiply<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.479> times<00:02:08.840> five<00:02:09.260> and<00:02:10.930> see<00:02:11.930> what<00:02:12.050> that

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
multiply it times five and see what that

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.920 
multiply it times five and see what that
looks<00:02:12.260> like<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.850> that's<00:02:17.300> gonna<00:02:17.510> work<00:02:17.720> for

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
looks like and and that's gonna work for

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.230 
looks like and and that's gonna work for
now<00:02:18.050> we<00:02:18.110> can<00:02:18.410> change<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.800> later<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.780> let's<00:02:22.240> get

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
now we can change it later so let's get

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.160 
now we can change it later so let's get
our<00:02:23.420> outliner<00:02:23.900> out<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:25.250> open<00:02:26.180> up<00:02:26.330> our<00:02:26.570> groups

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
our outliner out and open up our groups

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:35.729 
our outliner out and open up our groups
of<00:02:27.650> references

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.099 

start<00:02:36.739> at<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.010> top<00:02:37.099> one<00:02:38.090> make<00:02:38.599> sure<00:02:38.810> it's<00:02:38.989> not

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
start at the top one make sure it's not

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.039 
start at the top one make sure it's not
the<00:02:39.170> group<00:02:39.469> note<00:02:40.480> then<00:02:41.480> go<00:02:41.629> all<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.900> way<00:02:41.930> the

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
the group note then go all the way the

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.360 
the group note then go all the way the
last<00:02:42.290> one<00:02:42.499> and<00:02:42.920> then<00:02:43.930> holding<00:02:44.930> ctrl<00:02:45.379> unselect

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
last one and then holding ctrl unselect

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.679 
last one and then holding ctrl unselect
the<00:02:46.730> group<00:02:47.030> notes<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:48.079> top<00:02:48.290> group<00:02:49.569> so<00:02:50.569> we

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
the group notes the top group so we

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:56.830 
the group notes the top group so we
don't<00:02:50.900> get<00:02:51.079> double<00:02:51.650> against<00:02:52.069> them<00:02:52.280> soon<00:02:55.840> make

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
don't get double against them soon make

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.240 
don't get double against them soon make
sure<00:02:57.049> that's<00:02:57.200> right<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.799> then<00:02:57.920> we<00:02:58.040> can

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
sure that's right and then we can

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.500 
sure that's right and then we can
control<00:02:58.819> select<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.629> particle<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:02.150> go

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
control select a particle and go

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.379 
control select a particle and go
instance<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:05.599> we'll<00:03:05.840> have<00:03:06.049> an<00:03:06.169> instance<00:03:06.590> here

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
instance and we'll have an instance here

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.809 
instance and we'll have an instance here
if<00:03:08.389> you<00:03:08.540> go<00:03:08.659> to<00:03:08.719> actually<00:03:09.139> be<00:03:09.230> an<00:03:09.319> editor<00:03:09.819> it'll

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
if you go to actually be an editor it'll

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.849 
if you go to actually be an editor it'll
list<00:03:11.060> everything<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:11.989> just<00:03:12.260> selected<00:03:12.709> in

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
list everything you just selected in

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.330 
list everything you just selected in
there<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:14.230> over<00:03:15.230> here<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:15.680> their<00:03:15.889> index

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
there and over here is their index

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.699 
there and over here is their index
starting<00:03:16.969> at<00:03:17.449> 0<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.319> our<00:03:19.060> Keshia<00:03:20.060> girl<00:03:20.709> starts

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
starting at 0 so our Keshia girl starts

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.080 
starting at 0 so our Keshia girl starts
at<00:03:21.859> 0<00:03:22.250> goes<00:03:22.909> to<00:03:22.989> 15<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.409> then<00:03:24.669> our<00:03:25.669> next<00:03:25.819> one

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
at 0 goes to 15 and then our next one

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.559 
at 0 goes to 15 and then our next one
starts<00:03:26.510> so<00:03:27.109> we're<00:03:27.319> going<00:03:27.469> to<00:03:28.269> give<00:03:29.269> each

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
starts so we're going to give each

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.080 
starts so we're going to give each
particle<00:03:30.109> a<00:03:30.319> random<00:03:30.769> value<00:03:30.949> and<00:03:31.370> based<00:03:31.909> on

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
particle a random value and based on

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.610 
particle a random value and based on
that<00:03:32.269> value<00:03:32.510> we're<00:03:32.810> going<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.079> decide<00:03:33.379> what

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
that value we're going to decide what

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.879 
that value we're going to decide what
character<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.159> is<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.750> what<00:03:35.750> frame<00:03:36.169> of<00:03:36.199> the

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
character it is and what frame of the

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.860 
character it is and what frame of the
animation<00:03:36.919> is<00:03:37.579> gonna<00:03:37.790> be<00:03:38.060> born<00:03:38.389> in<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.970> let's

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
animation is gonna be born in so let's

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.069 
animation is gonna be born in so let's
get<00:03:42.579> some<00:03:43.579> custom<00:03:44.030> attributes<00:03:44.599> in<00:03:44.810> here

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
get some custom attributes in here

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.710 
get some custom attributes in here
called<00:03:45.680> character<00:03:48.430> flow<00:03:49.430> per<00:03:49.699> particle<00:03:50.060> and

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
called character flow per particle and

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:59.170 
called character flow per particle and
custom<00:03:51.259> index<00:03:55.060> okay

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.660 

in<00:03:59.780> our<00:04:00.230> creation<00:04:00.650> expression<00:04:02.860> character

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.580

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
equals truncated random value of

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.550 
equals truncated random value of
truncated<00:04:13.209> means<00:04:14.209> it's<00:04:14.480> going<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:14.989> take<00:04:15.349> any

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
truncated means it's going to take any

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.039 
truncated means it's going to take any
decimal<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.400> round<00:04:16.850> it<00:04:17.000> back<00:04:17.239> down<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.930> the

decimal and round it back down to the

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:28.300 
decimal and round it back down to the
nearest<00:04:18.350> whole<00:04:18.590> number<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:27.260> have<00:04:27.620> five

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
nearest whole number and I have five

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.540 
nearest whole number and I have five
characters<00:04:29.560> someone<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.650> go<00:04:30.800> between<00:04:30.949> zero

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
characters someone to go between zero

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.779 
characters someone to go between zero
and<00:04:32.919> five<00:04:35.169> which<00:04:36.169> is<00:04:36.199> one<00:04:37.039> more<00:04:37.280> than<00:04:37.639> our

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
and five which is one more than our

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.890 
and five which is one more than our
characters<00:04:38.360> which<00:04:38.630> is<00:04:38.810> what<00:04:38.990> we<00:04:39.080> need<00:04:39.289> okay

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.110 

and<00:04:44.900> then<00:04:45.110> I<00:04:45.289> have<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.530> syntax<00:04:45.979> error<00:04:46.280> because<00:04:46.850> I

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
and then I have a syntax error because I

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:56.250 
and then I have a syntax error because I
forgot<00:04:47.570> that<00:04:47.900> parenthesis<00:04:48.770> there<00:04:49.310> we<00:04:49.400> go

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.450 

after<00:04:57.220> our<00:05:00.000> birth<00:05:01.000> position<00:05:01.300> information<00:05:02.460> I'm

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
after our birth position information I'm

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.830 
after our birth position information I'm
going<00:05:03.610> to<00:05:03.700> add<00:05:03.910> what<00:05:04.810> I<00:05:04.840> have<00:05:05.230> previously

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
going to add what I have previously

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:16.740 
going to add what I have previously
created<00:05:11.640> so<00:05:13.830> our<00:05:14.830> character<00:05:15.280> value<00:05:16.060> is<00:05:16.330> zero

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
created so our character value is zero

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.240 
created so our character value is zero
it's<00:05:17.380> gonna<00:05:17.620> be<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:18.130> girl<00:05:19.260> and<00:05:20.260> her<00:05:20.650> instances

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
it's gonna be the girl and her instances

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.340 
it's gonna be the girl and her instances
are<00:05:21.520> from<00:05:21.760> 0<00:05:22.000> to<00:05:22.120> 15<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:22.810> that's<00:05:22.870> gonna<00:05:23.050> pick

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
are from 0 to 15 so that's gonna pick

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.790 
are from 0 to 15 so that's gonna pick
one<00:05:23.380> of<00:05:23.620> those<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:24.570> it's<00:05:25.570> gonna<00:05:25.720> set<00:05:26.110> the

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
one of those and it's gonna set the

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.770 
one of those and it's gonna set the
speed<00:05:27.040> to<00:05:27.100> point<00:05:27.430> zero<00:05:27.700> five<00:05:27.940> this<00:05:28.330> is<00:05:28.510> just<00:05:28.660> a

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
speed to point zero five this is just a

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.870 
speed to point zero five this is just a
value<00:05:28.990> I<00:05:29.170> played<00:05:29.650> with<00:05:29.860> until<00:05:30.430> it<00:05:30.610> looked

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
value I played with until it looked

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.370 
value I played with until it looked
right<00:05:31.120> with<00:05:32.110> her<00:05:32.260> animation<00:05:33.210> so<00:05:34.210> in<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:34.870> other

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
right with her animation so in the other

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.870 
right with her animation so in the other
tutorials<00:05:36.540> there's<00:05:37.540> a<00:05:37.690> speed<00:05:38.590> here<00:05:39.520> that

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
tutorials there's a speed here that

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.490 
tutorials there's a speed here that
we're<00:05:40.030> going<00:05:40.240> to<00:05:40.330> delete<00:05:40.720> because<00:05:41.290> each

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
we're going to delete because each

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.080 
we're going to delete because each
character<00:05:41.980> is<00:05:42.070> gonna<00:05:42.250> get<00:05:42.370> its<00:05:42.520> own<00:05:42.670> custom

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
character is gonna get its own custom

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.920 
character is gonna get its own custom
speed<00:05:44.460> in<00:05:45.460> character<00:05:45.910> 1<00:05:46.120> which<00:05:46.360> is<00:05:46.540> the<00:05:46.750> guy

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
speed in character 1 which is the guy

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.920 
speed in character 1 which is the guy
his<00:05:47.410> instances<00:05:48.130> are<00:05:48.400> from<00:05:48.610> 16<00:05:49.120> to<00:05:49.150> 31<00:05:51.510> in<00:05:52.510> his

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
his instances are from 16 to 31 in his

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.780 
his instances are from 16 to 31 in his
speed<00:05:53.230> is<00:05:53.410> his<00:05:53.710> animation<00:05:54.190> is<00:05:54.280> the<00:05:54.310> same<00:05:54.640> as

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
speed is his animation is the same as

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
speed is his animation is the same as
scarole<00:05:55.210> so<00:05:55.450> their<00:05:56.110> speed<00:05:56.440> is<00:05:56.590> the<00:05:56.680> same<00:05:57.810> you

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
scarole so their speed is the same you

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.920 
scarole so their speed is the same you
know<00:05:58.960> post<00:05:59.410> this<00:05:59.800> expression<00:06:00.580> I<00:06:00.790> don't<00:06:01.720> to<00:06:01.810> go

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
know post this expression I don't to go

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.280 
know post this expression I don't to go
through<00:06:02.170> every<00:06:02.590> single<00:06:02.800> one<00:06:03.010> but<00:06:03.870> our<00:06:04.870> zombie

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
through every single one but our zombie

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.590 
through every single one but our zombie
guy<00:06:05.440> he<00:06:05.860> moves<00:06:06.370> a<00:06:06.520> little<00:06:06.640> slower<00:06:07.030> so<00:06:07.390> his

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
guy he moves a little slower so his

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.960 
guy he moves a little slower so his
speed<00:06:07.930> is<00:06:08.320> a<00:06:08.590> lot<00:06:09.130> slower<00:06:09.400> than<00:06:09.760> everybody

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
speed is a lot slower than everybody

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:16.110 
speed is a lot slower than everybody
else's<00:06:11.880> so<00:06:12.880> what<00:06:13.840> that<00:06:14.410> done<00:06:15.130> we<00:06:15.520> can<00:06:15.760> plug<00:06:16.090> in

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
else's so what that done we can plug in

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.030 
else's so what that done we can plug in
our<00:06:17.820> custom<00:06:18.820> index<00:06:19.240> to<00:06:19.660> the<00:06:20.350> instance<00:06:20.830> our

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
our custom index to the instance our

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.970 
our custom index to the instance our
index
