00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
were made they took desk of blotters and

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.319 
were made they took desk of blotters and
they<00:00:35.300> would<00:00:35.510> soak<00:00:35.870> them<00:00:36.170> in<00:00:36.200> glue<00:00:37.210> probably<00:00:38.210> in

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
they would soak them in glue probably in

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.420 
they would soak them in glue probably in
horsehide<00:00:38.930> glue<00:00:39.380> which<00:00:39.620> is<00:00:39.650> what<00:00:39.950> they<00:00:40.100> used

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
horsehide glue which is what they used

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.260 
horsehide glue which is what they used
back<00:00:40.760> then

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
back then

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.740 
back then
and<00:00:41.450> once<00:00:42.440> they<00:00:42.650> saturated<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.730> blotter<00:00:44.420> with

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
and once they saturated the blotter with

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.080 
and once they saturated the blotter with
glue<00:00:45.140> then<00:00:45.890> they<00:00:46.100> would<00:00:46.280> place<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:46.820> body

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
glue then they would place the body

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.200 
glue then they would place the body
inside<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:47.960> hold<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:48.860> that's<00:00:49.580> how<00:00:49.820> they<00:00:50.000> got

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
inside and hold and that's how they got

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.400 
inside and hold and that's how they got
these<00:00:50.480> as<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:51.020> can<00:00:51.260> see<00:00:52.150> they<00:00:53.150> are<00:00:53.180> solid<00:00:54.170> they

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
inside the head and to make it easier

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.929 
inside the head and to make it easier
for<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.020> understand<00:01:09.860> I<00:01:10.250> have<00:01:10.490> an<00:01:10.640> original

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
for you to understand I have an original

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.510 
for you to understand I have an original
McElroy<00:01:11.840> cradle<00:01:12.409> right<00:01:12.650> here<00:01:12.979> out<00:01:13.220> of<00:01:13.430> the

McElroy cradle right here out of the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.359 
McElroy cradle right here out of the
body<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.200> this<00:01:15.200> would<00:01:15.409> be<00:01:15.530> mounted<00:01:15.710> on<00:01:16.130> the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
body so this would be mounted on the

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.680 
body so this would be mounted on the
sides<00:01:16.640> of<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.090> neck<00:01:17.270> as<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:18.140> can<00:01:18.320> see<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.690> it

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
was able to swing front and back to give

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.660 
was able to swing front and back to give
the<00:01:24.050> movement<00:01:24.440> of<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.710> eyes<00:01:24.860> looking<00:01:25.280> up<00:01:25.430> and

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
the movement of the eyes looking up and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.390 
the movement of the eyes looking up and
down<00:01:25.820> or<00:01:26.150> side<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.750> side<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:27.409> make<00:01:28.010> the<00:01:28.220> head

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
down or side to side to make the head

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.510 
down or side to side to make the head
move<00:01:28.700> for<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.450> eye<00:01:29.480> so<00:01:29.870> up<00:01:30.020> side<00:01:30.260> to<00:01:30.530> side<00:01:30.770> the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
move for the eye so up side to side the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.330 
move for the eye so up side to side the
head<00:01:31.700> stick<00:01:32.030> slip<00:01:32.270> right<00:01:32.720> down<00:01:32.960> on<00:01:33.200> this<00:01:33.500> metal

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
head stick slip right down on this metal

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.719 
head stick slip right down on this metal
rod<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.570> that's<00:01:36.409> what's<00:01:36.710> inside<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.490> body

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
rod so that's what's inside the body

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.050 
rod so that's what's inside the body
here<00:01:38.409> now<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.500> McIlroy's<00:01:40.130> also<00:01:40.580> used<00:01:40.850> a

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
here now the McIlroy's also used a

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.850 
here now the McIlroy's also used a
system<00:01:41.330> of<00:01:41.800> toggles<00:01:42.909> with<00:01:43.909> a<00:01:43.940> rubber<00:01:44.860> type

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
system of toggles with a rubber type

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.530 
system of toggles with a rubber type
cloth<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:47.570> hold<00:01:47.870> this<00:01:48.590> in<00:01:48.860> place<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.120> the

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
cloth to hold this in place so that the

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.570 
cloth to hold this in place so that the
head<00:01:51.080> would<00:01:51.260> stay<00:01:51.530> up<00:01:51.560> straight<00:01:52.010> when<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.430> was

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
head would stay up straight when it was

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.270 
head would stay up straight when it was
beings<00:01:52.909> not<00:01:53.690> when<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:54.020> was<00:01:54.140> not<00:01:54.320> being<00:01:54.530> used<00:01:54.650> as

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
beings not when it was not being used as

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.910 
beings not when it was not being used as
you<00:01:55.430> can<00:01:55.610> see<00:01:55.820> this<00:01:55.970> really<00:01:56.960> gives<00:01:57.170> easy

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
you can see this really gives easy

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.730 
you can see this really gives easy
movement<00:01:58.700> in<00:01:58.820> any<00:01:59.060> direction<00:01:59.360> for<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.049> to

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
movement in any direction for that to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.990 
movement in any direction for that to
work<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:04.070> hands<00:02:04.520> were<00:02:04.670> cast<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:07.000> plastic

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
work the hands were cast and plastic

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.589 
work the hands were cast and plastic
wood<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.989> they<00:02:09.649> were<00:02:09.769> attached<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.610> muslin

wood and they were attached to muslin

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.929 
wood and they were attached to muslin
and<00:02:11.870> then<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.860> will<00:02:12.980> cross<00:02:13.189> stitched<00:02:13.640> and

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
and then it will cross stitched and

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:18.480 
and then it will cross stitched and
attach<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.260> body<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:17.209> legs

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
attach to the body the legs

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.930 
attach to the body the legs
we're<00:02:19.240> done<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:19.600> muslin<00:02:20.340> they<00:02:21.340> were<00:02:21.490> bolted
