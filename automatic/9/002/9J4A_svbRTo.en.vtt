 sell this transformation where we go 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.230
 to do with milk in several rows 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.260
 from the region one or two cheese factories

 poetry that the cheese factories at the end of

 mushrooms in lake saint jean 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.769

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.570
 cheese in Quebec we are eaters 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.160
 cheese within lake saint jean but to

 the time to eat cheese does not matter 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.390
 say for them it's a product for them 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.010
 rich of our luxury goods yet 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 Walking not what we want is that 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.200
 actually you can do that why soothsayer 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.420
 with the cheese that is exported and its 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.320
 year's income at the top of a context of 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.390
 19th century 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.860
 it's important young people do 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.110
 of agriculture is to live 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.850
 their family and it takes him income 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.290
 extra 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.510
 cheese dairy herberie need 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.520
 to buy from milk growers at 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.990
 the time we call the boss that makes a 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.360
 not very suspicious but that's how 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.130
 call the boss and this boss love 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.600
 just bring milk every day but 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.030
 initially what is causing the problem 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.770
 we do not have enough of that 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.540
 consequence of the establishment of its 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.870
 brigand cheese factories and demand 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.620
 who we were going to get fat 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.110
 enormously the troops 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.670
 he goes the wheat field and gradually 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.710
 the little black and white cows 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.660
 will appear in the agricultural landscape 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.490
 of Quebec 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.320
 cheese making at the time 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.110
 you are so important it's okay 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.479
 so much transformed the agricultural economy 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.370
 and the general economy of Quebec that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.599
 will say that the Quebec cheddar of the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.890
 late 19th century 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.310
 it is the flagship of the economy 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.310
 Quebec 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.980
 it's beautiful sportsman cheese but at 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.680
 the time we have a problem the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.080
 conservation at the start we had the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.550
 cheese by boat but the boats that 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.800
 are registered chemicals are not 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.810
 equipped to keep the front the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.630
 boats that contain places and 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.890
 was managed his care québec be moria done 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.989
 that at the beginning must take our cheese 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.170
 eyelashes exported either by ship or by 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.040
 very bring him to montreal memorial become 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.160
 an intermediary 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.840
 alas, intermediate laffoley the country the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.580
 farmers have found that having a 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.459
 intermedia it did not please them at all 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.040
 the world here come together to make them a 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.019
 cheese exchange founding a grouping 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.540
 Cheese auction 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.820
 annually and there they will fix the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.300
 price selling cheese with profitable 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.360
 to everybody 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.750
 fx she takes on the whole cheese 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.459
 that we had exported made it a balance sheet 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.080
 first twenty years exports 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.910
 cheese in the region 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.380
 the cheese exchange or the auction of 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.600
 cheeses have been more profitable to 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.260
 farmers that if they had continued 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.930
 to go through the world to 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.829
 the export of cheeses were 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.079
 considerable if we rely on 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.090
 chronicles of the time we will say that 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.880
 it's millions and millions of km 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.010
 which goes to England to the countries 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.510
 British for export 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.370
 at the start the cheese factories works 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.870
 a few months a year under treated 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.100
 until the fall is like in 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.590
 cheese export 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.210
 we have trouble keeping the 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.000
 milk that is harvested is also cheese 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.950
 gradually produce 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.260
 non- electrified campaigns and water 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.180
 electricity will happen it will become 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.100
 an important energy source the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.990
 refrigeration also in the years towards 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.310
 the 30's had to arrive the 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.050
 first cooler for those of 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.310
 refrigerators will arrive and the 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.070
 from now on it will be possible to 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.040
 keep the milk that will be as 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.020
 possible to keep the cheese going 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.130
 also be possible to diversify 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.540
 products 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.640
 this is where cream la cie will arrive 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.040
 other products will happen that's going 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.900
 also allow the creation of 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.420
 recurrent and important dairies in the 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.800
 regional landscape for a long time the 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.540
 delivery of milk to the houses 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.200
 really have delivery of the hqe 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.790
 in tibet in the 20s during 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.290
 long time it was the cheddar that was 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.790
 the trademark 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.590
 cheese production within 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.960
 the region focused but for some years 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.510
 for several decades a multitude 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.670
 small producers of rice cheeses 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.380
 were set up in the region and 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.390
 it's them now that they have 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.900
 diversify cheese production 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.900
 within axis
