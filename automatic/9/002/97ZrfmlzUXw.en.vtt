00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.240 
had a lot of fun playing that game now
during<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.360> time<00:01:38.360> consoles<00:01:39.979> were<00:01:40.979> pretty

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
during that time consoles were pretty

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:50.960 
during that time consoles were pretty
good<00:01:44.930> at<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.200> time<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:49.310> highest-end<00:01:50.310> console

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
good at the time the highest-end console

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.919 
good at the time the highest-end console
would<00:01:51.300> be<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.840> Neo<00:01:52.050> Geo<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.610> if<00:01:57.390> none<00:01:57.899> of

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
would be like the Neo Geo and if none of

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.660 
would be like the Neo Geo and if none of
you<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.289> familiar<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:58.950> suggest<00:01:59.550> you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you are familiar with that suggest you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.219 
you are familiar with that suggest you
google<00:01:59.910> it<00:02:01.850> but<00:02:02.850> not<00:02:03.179> many<00:02:03.420> people<00:02:03.750> own<00:02:03.960> them

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
google it but not many people own them

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.660 
google it but not many people own them
because<00:02:04.530> they<00:02:04.710> were<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.280> expensive<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:10.670> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
because they were so expensive and the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.640 
because they were so expensive and the
popular<00:02:12.120> consoles<00:02:12.600> at<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.930> time<00:02:13.200> would<00:02:13.470> have

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
popular consoles at that time would have

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.350 
popular consoles at that time would have
been<00:02:13.709> like<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.250> sega<00:02:14.610> genesis<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.330> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
been like the sega genesis in the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.030 
been like the sega genesis in the
nintendo<00:02:16.700> which<00:02:17.700> had<00:02:18.440> pretty<00:02:19.440> bad<00:02:19.709> graphics

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
nintendo which had pretty bad graphics

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.880 
nintendo which had pretty bad graphics
compared<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.150> Neo<00:02:21.360> Geo<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:22.560> Neo<00:02:22.769> Geo

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
compared to the Neo Geo the Neo Geo

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.490 
compared to the Neo Geo the Neo Geo
graphics<00:02:23.579> were<00:02:23.820> very<00:02:24.269> comparable<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
graphics were very comparable to the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.680 
graphics were very comparable to the
arcade<00:02:25.920> graphics

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.040 

so<00:02:31.690> at<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.110> time<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.860> really<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.790> best

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
so at that time the really the best
