probably<00:01:32.820> now<00:01:33.090> than<00:01:33.299> they've<00:01:33.450> ever<00:01:33.540> been<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
probably now than they've ever been and

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.140 
probably now than they've ever been and
and<00:01:35.040> mentally<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.760> about<00:01:36.090> getting

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and mentally it's just about getting

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.640
