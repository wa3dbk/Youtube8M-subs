00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
okay so I thought I might as well do a

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.860 
okay so I thought I might as well do a
video<00:00:02.370> about<00:00:02.550> driving<00:00:03.120> in<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.330> snow<00:00:03.389> while

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
video about driving in the snow while

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.099 
video about driving in the snow while
I'm<00:00:04.020> out<00:00:04.140> and<00:00:04.259> about<00:00:05.150> few<00:00:06.150> tips<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:06.720> just

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
I'm out and about few tips for you just

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.290 
I'm out and about few tips for you just
basic<00:00:07.500> stuff<00:00:07.589> you<00:00:07.919> see<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.370> road<00:00:08.670> there's

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
basic stuff you see on this road there's

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.580 
basic stuff you see on this road there's
a<00:00:09.360> track<00:00:09.719> down<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.139> middle<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.440> road

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
a track down the middle of the road

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.560 
a track down the middle of the road
which<00:00:10.860> I'm<00:00:11.040> driving<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.550> calls<00:00:12.090> almost<00:00:12.269> try

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
which I'm driving it calls almost try

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.690 
which I'm driving it calls almost try
and<00:00:12.690> driving<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.110> trucks<00:00:13.519> the<00:00:14.519> further

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
and driving the trucks the further

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.310 
and driving the trucks the further
vehicles<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.330> probably<00:00:15.660> not<00:00:15.750> safe<00:00:16.080> than

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
vehicles it's probably not safe than

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.170 
vehicles it's probably not safe than
trying<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.590> drive<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> snow<00:00:17.340> because<00:00:18.090> he

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
trying to drive on the snow because he

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.970 
trying to drive on the snow because he
must<00:00:18.359> speed<00:00:18.600> though<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.960> down<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.289> about<00:00:19.410> 4:15

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
must speed though is down to about 4:15

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.260 
must speed though is down to about 4:15
60<00:00:20.490> miles<00:00:20.730> an<00:00:20.880> hour

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
60 miles an hour

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.029 
60 miles an hour
obviously<00:00:22.080> keep<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.289> speed<00:00:22.560> down<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
obviously keep the speed down in the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.250 
obviously keep the speed down in the
snow<00:00:23.550> eating<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.660> keep<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> speed

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
snow eating this so I keep the speed

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.650 
snow eating this so I keep the speed
down<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> snow<00:00:26.130> what<00:00:26.939> keep<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.269> slow<00:00:27.539> in

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
down in the snow what keep you slow in

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.019 
down in the snow what keep you slow in

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
other line are sizes to be weird if I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.860 
other line are sizes to be weird if I
was<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.460> now<00:00:59.730> I've<00:00:59.940> had<00:01:00.180> time<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> stay

was to like now I've had time to stay
where<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.140> could<00:01:01.350> make<00:01:01.530> now<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.670> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
where I could make now see what that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
where I could make now see what that
garage<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> distance<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.170> garage<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> Left

the<00:01:29.520> snow<00:01:29.790> do<00:01:30.270> keep<00:01:30.509> speed<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.020> that's<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> main

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the snow do keep speed a that's the main
