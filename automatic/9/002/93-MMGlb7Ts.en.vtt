of having a untapped jewel like a qdoba
that<00:00:53.640> potentially<00:00:54.120> could<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:54.750> more

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that potentially could go a little more

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.319 
that potentially could go a little more
national<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.550> give<00:00:56.670> them<00:00:56.879> another

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
national and give them another

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.520 
national and give them another
opportunity<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.050> increase<00:00:58.320> shareholder

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
opportunity to increase shareholder

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.220 
opportunity to increase shareholder
value<00:00:59.039> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.270> also<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.750> player

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
value and then you also have a player

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.650 
value and then you also have a player
like<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.469> sonic<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.059> drive-in

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.600 
like a sonic with you know the drive-in
and<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.960> big<00:01:04.140> cult<00:01:04.379> following<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.220> think

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and a big cult following but I think

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.770 
and a big cult following but I think
what's<00:01:05.760> interesting<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.420> three<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
those while it could be interesting from

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.310 
those while it could be interesting from
a<00:01:08.340> private<00:01:08.670> equity's<00:01:08.970> take<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> step<00:01:09.930> back<00:01:10.110> and
