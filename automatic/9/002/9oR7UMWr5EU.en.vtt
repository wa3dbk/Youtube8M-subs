into the big wide world and once again

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.520 
into the big wide world and once again
the<00:02:11.100> debate<00:02:11.280> rages<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.810> levels<00:02:13.200> getting

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the debate rages are a levels getting

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.430 
the debate rages are a levels getting
easier<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:14.760> surely<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.270> bottom<00:02:15.690> line<00:02:16.050> here

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
easier but surely the bottom line here

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.130 
easier but surely the bottom line here
is<00:02:16.620> do<00:02:17.310> they<00:02:17.490> prepare<00:02:17.880> students<00:02:18.510> either<00:02:18.750> for

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
is do they prepare students either for

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.280 
is do they prepare students either for
university<00:02:19.800> or<00:02:20.040> for<00:02:20.910> life<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.420> don't<00:02:21.900> think

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
university or for life I don't think

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.530 
university or for life I don't think
that<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.740> levels<00:02:23.130> on<00:02:23.280> its<00:02:23.430> own<00:02:23.670> are<00:02:24.000> an<00:02:24.180> adequate

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
that a levels on its own are an adequate

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.050 
that a levels on its own are an adequate
preparation<00:02:24.810> either<00:02:25.320> for<00:02:25.590> university<00:02:26.280> or<00:02:26.700> for

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
preparation either for university or for

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.370 
preparation either for university or for
employments<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.810> think<00:02:28.020> one<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
employments and I think one of the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.450 
employments and I think one of the
things<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.680> we<00:02:28.800> try<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.130> do<00:02:29.220> with<00:02:29.370> our

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
things that we try and do with our

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.120 
things that we try and do with our
students<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.390> educate<00:02:30.510> beyond<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.680> level<00:02:32.010> so

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
students is to educate beyond a level so

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.950 
students is to educate beyond a level so
it's<00:02:32.250> not<00:02:32.460> just<00:02:32.520> in<00:02:32.850> subject<00:02:33.330> knowledge<00:02:33.480> but

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
it's not just in subject knowledge but

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.480 
it's not just in subject knowledge but
that's<00:02:34.110> also<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.440> developing<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.040> character

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
that's also in developing the character

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.850 
that's also in developing the character
and<00:02:35.640> personality<00:02:35.820> people<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.530> what<00:02:37.710> will

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
and personality people so what will

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.340 
and personality people so what will
Gideon<00:02:38.250> do<00:02:38.490> after<00:02:38.820> Cambridge<00:02:39.360> either<00:02:39.930> feel

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350
