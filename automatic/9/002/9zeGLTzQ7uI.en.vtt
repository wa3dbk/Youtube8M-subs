00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
problems with it it's rusty on the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.020 
problems with it it's rusty on the
underside<00:01:57.759> but<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.130> say<00:02:00.369> it<00:02:00.520> always<00:02:00.700> runs

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
underside but like I say it always runs

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.569 
underside but like I say it always runs
runs<00:02:01.719> really<00:02:02.020> well<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:05.039> I'm<00:02:06.039> probably<00:02:06.340> going

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
runs really well and I'm probably going

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.960 
runs really well and I'm probably going
to<00:02:07.709> replace<00:02:08.709> some<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.160> tin<00:02:09.369> work<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:09.819> it

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
to replace some of the tin work on it

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.740 
to replace some of the tin work on it
the<00:02:10.090> front<00:02:10.360> fenders<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.819> box<00:02:13.060> sides<00:02:13.450> and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
the front fenders and the box sides and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.580 
the front fenders and the box sides and
such<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:15.040> hard<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.900> not<00:02:16.900> replace<00:02:17.349> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
such and it's hard to not replace it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.100 
such and it's hard to not replace it
when<00:02:18.209> when<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.299> truck<00:02:19.540> runs<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.019> good<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:22.110> when

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
when when the truck runs so good so when

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.330 
when when the truck runs so good so when
I<00:02:23.140> got<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.349> little<00:02:23.530> bit<00:02:23.739> more<00:02:23.769> battery<00:02:24.310> life

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
I got a little bit more battery life

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.670 
I got a little bit more battery life
maybe<00:02:25.239> I'll<00:02:25.420> do<00:02:25.540> another<00:02:25.780> video<00:02:26.019> here<00:02:26.470> but

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
maybe I'll do another video here but

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.479 
maybe I'll do another video here but
until<00:02:27.099> then<00:02:28.620> keep<00:02:29.620> on<00:02:29.799> making<00:02:30.040> videos<00:02:30.250> and

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
until then keep on making videos and

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.090 
until then keep on making videos and
we'll<00:02:33.489> talk<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.819> you<00:02:33.910> later
