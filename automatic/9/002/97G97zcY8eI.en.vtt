00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
curly one and this one is the my own

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.550 
curly one and this one is the my own
part<00:01:11.420> where<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.540> shows<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.290> have

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
part where it shows you know you have

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560 
part where it shows you know you have
the<00:01:13.710> option<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.220> cut<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> lace<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.390> guess

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the option to cut the lace and I guess

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.030 
the option to cut the lace and I guess
leave<00:01:15.780> some<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.229> hair<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.439> or<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.890> could

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
leave some of your hair out or you could

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.609 
leave some of your hair out or you could
just<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.610> natural<00:01:18.210> part<00:01:18.689> again<00:01:18.960> like

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
just go with the natural part again like

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.440 
just go with the natural part again like
I<00:01:19.770> said<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.040> want<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> notch<00:01:21.150> upon

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
I said I want with the notch upon

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.090 
I said I want with the notch upon
because<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.960> looks<00:01:22.110> very<00:01:22.170> very<00:01:22.560> nice

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
because I think it looks very very nice

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.640 
because I think it looks very very nice
so<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:24.119> does<00:01:24.330> say<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> has<00:01:24.810> lace<00:01:25.110> parting

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
so it does say it has lace parting

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.620 
so it does say it has lace parting
natural<00:01:26.369> parting<00:01:26.700> line<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.479> option

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
natural parting line you have the option

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.020 
natural parting line you have the option
to<00:01:27.930> split<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> part<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.549> it's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
to split the part all of that and it's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
to split the part all of that and it's
just<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.750> fun<00:01:30.869> wit<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.530> course

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
you got some eyelash as long as you

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.659 
you got some eyelash as long as you
don't<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.440> know<00:04:20.560> brush<00:04:20.859> it<00:04:21.039> too<00:04:21.190> much<00:04:21.430> it

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
seems like to be a pretty good as far as

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.810

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
you do want to have a little bit tightly

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.000 
you do want to have a little bit tightly

do have you know the option to take the

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.530 
do have you know the option to take the
elastic<00:04:39.430> band<00:04:39.640> just<00:04:39.910> hook<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.180> on<00:04:40.330> together

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
elastic band just hook it on together

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.360 
elastic band just hook it on together
two<00:04:41.200> combs<00:04:41.440> in<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.680> front<00:04:41.920> that<00:04:42.040> you<00:04:42.160> can

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
two combs in the front that you can

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.280 
two combs in the front that you can
attach<00:04:42.670> you<00:04:42.880> know<00:04:43.000> for<00:04:43.210> more<00:04:43.390> of<00:04:43.480> a<00:04:43.570> secure<00:04:43.960> fit

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290

attach you know for more of a secure fit
and<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:44.800> think<00:04:45.070> those<00:04:45.250> two<00:04:45.280> were<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:45.820> only

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
and I think those two were the only

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.600 
and I think those two were the only
combs<00:04:46.450> in<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.500> unit<00:04:47.830> like<00:04:47.950> I<00:04:48.040> don't<00:04:48.190> feel<00:04:48.370> any

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
combs in the unit like I don't feel any

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.100 
combs in the unit like I don't feel any
other<00:04:48.760> combs<00:04:49.060> in<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.450> so<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:49.660> know<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:49.990> it's

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
other combs in it so you know it it's

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.600 
other combs in it so you know it it's
pretty<00:04:50.290> snug<00:04:50.680> like<00:04:50.890> even<00:04:51.220> if<00:04:51.340> you're<00:04:51.460> not

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
pretty snug like even if you're not

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.850 
pretty snug like even if you're not
going<00:04:51.790> to<00:04:51.850> part<00:04:52.120> it<00:04:52.240> it<00:04:52.900> feels<00:04:53.230> pretty<00:04:53.380> far<00:04:53.710> as

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
going to part it it feels pretty far as

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.350 
going to part it it feels pretty far as
a<00:04:53.890> parting<00:04:54.340> goes<00:04:54.520> that's<00:04:54.730> pretty<00:04:55.000> much<00:04:55.150> what

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
a parting goes that's pretty much what

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.320 
a parting goes that's pretty much what
it<00:04:55.390> looks<00:04:55.570> like<00:04:55.780> um<00:04:56.200> I'm<00:04:57.160> not<00:04:57.340> sure<00:04:57.400> if<00:04:57.760> it's<00:04:57.910> a

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
it looks like um I'm not sure if it's a

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.790 
it looks like um I'm not sure if it's a
party<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:58.900> you<00:04:59.080> could<00:04:59.230> do<00:04:59.320> all<00:04:59.350> around

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
party that you could do all around

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.160 
party that you could do all around
that's<00:05:00.370> what<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:00.670> looks<00:05:00.850> like<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.750> model

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
that's what it looks like the model

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.020 
that's what it looks like the model
shows<00:05:02.410> that<00:05:02.680> you<00:05:02.860> know<00:05:02.980> she<00:05:03.010> has<00:05:03.430> hers<00:05:03.670> you

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
shows that you know she has hers you

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.870 
shows that you know she has hers you
know<00:05:04.060> with<00:05:04.810> a<00:05:04.840> side<00:05:05.200> swoop<00:05:05.590> so<00:05:05.800> I<00:05:05.830> do<00:05:06.100> think<00:05:06.790> you

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
know with a side swoop so I do think you

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.340 
know with a side swoop so I do think you
could<00:05:07.090> potentially<00:05:07.570> if<00:05:07.660> you<00:05:07.750> wanted<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.170> you

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
could potentially if you wanted to you

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.780 
could potentially if you wanted to you
know<00:05:08.380> cut<00:05:08.680> this<00:05:08.830> down<00:05:09.040> and<00:05:09.220> leave<00:05:09.370> some<00:05:09.550> era

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
know cut this down and leave some era

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.430 
know cut this down and leave some era
you<00:05:10.000> could<00:05:10.210> do<00:05:10.390> that<00:05:10.420> so<00:05:10.780> gives<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:11.200> a<00:05:11.230> lot<00:05:11.380> of

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
you could do that so gives you a lot of

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.050 
you could do that so gives you a lot of
wave<00:05:11.740> of<00:05:11.950> playing<00:05:12.310> with<00:05:12.430> your<00:05:12.580> own<00:05:12.700> hair<00:05:12.940> as
