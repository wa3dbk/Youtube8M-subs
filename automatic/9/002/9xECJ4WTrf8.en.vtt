combustion<00:00:30.179> engines<00:00:30.539> were<00:00:30.720> built<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.410> this

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
combustion engines were built in this

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.979 
combustion engines were built in this
format<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.369> don't<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.540> completely

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
format I don't have it completely

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.690 
format I don't have it completely
finished<00:00:34.350> I've<00:00:34.559> got<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.800> running<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.430> still

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
finished I've got it running but I still

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.720 
finished I've got it running but I still
have<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.030> add<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.510> governor<00:00:37.460> mechanism<00:00:38.460> to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
have to add the governor mechanism to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.400 
have to add the governor mechanism to
make<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.059> running<00:00:39.420> hit<00:00:39.600> &amp;<00:00:39.629> miss<00:00:39.750> mode<00:00:40.140> right

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
make it running hit &amp; miss mode right

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.030 
make it running hit &amp; miss mode right
now<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.800> runs<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.399> straight<00:00:43.040> four-stroke

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
now it runs in the straight four-stroke

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.470 
now it runs in the straight four-stroke
mode<00:00:46.250> let<00:00:47.250> me<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.579> move<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> around<00:00:47.940> here<00:00:48.329> so

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
mode let me just move it around here so

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.940 
mode let me just move it around here so
you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.809> kind<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.320> them<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> little<00:00:49.559> bit

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.760 

this<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> primary<00:00:57.330> can<00:00:57.810> gear<00:00:58.200> and<00:00:58.470> this<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
this is the primary can gear and this is

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.670 
this is the primary can gear and this is
the<00:00:59.010> second<00:00:59.910> timing<00:01:00.390> gear<00:01:00.720> or<00:01:00.900> large<00:01:01.230> timing

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the second timing gear or large timing

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.440 
the second timing gear or large timing
gear<00:01:01.860> which<00:01:02.040> runs<00:01:02.280> at<00:01:02.430> 1/2<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:03.000> speed<00:01:03.240> of<00:01:03.360> the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
gear which runs at 1/2 the speed of the

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.980 
gear which runs at 1/2 the speed of the
crankshaft<00:01:04.940> that<00:01:05.940> drives<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> rocker<00:01:06.690> arm

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
crankshaft that drives the rocker arm

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.470 
crankshaft that drives the rocker arm
which<00:01:07.230> in<00:01:07.410> turn<00:01:07.680> pushes<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.760> push<00:01:08.970> rod<00:01:09.210> down

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
which in turn pushes the push rod down

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.180 
which in turn pushes the push rod down
and<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.870> is<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.200> valve<00:01:10.410> mechanism<00:01:10.620> down

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
and this is the valve mechanism down

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.560 
and this is the valve mechanism down
here<00:01:11.600> this<00:01:12.600> uses<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> quick<00:01:13.830> release<00:01:14.010> valve

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
here this uses a quick release valve

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
here this uses a quick release valve
that's<00:01:15.570> found<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.440> those<00:01:16.740> found<00:01:17.010> on<00:01:17.130> air

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
that's found like those found on air

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.930 
that's found like those found on air
guns<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.420> also<00:01:18.750> called<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.110> dump<00:01:19.380> valve

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
guns it's also called a dump valve

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.640 
guns it's also called a dump valve
basically<00:01:20.940> the<00:01:21.090> cam<00:01:21.330> holds<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:23.250> valve<00:01:23.490> closed

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
basically the cam holds the valve closed

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.980 
basically the cam holds the valve closed
until<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.830> ready<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.100> fire<00:01:26.430> whereupon<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
until it's ready to fire whereupon the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.340 
until it's ready to fire whereupon the
rocker<00:01:28.290> arm<00:01:28.650> falls<00:01:29.040> into<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.520> knotch

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
rocker arm falls into this knotch

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.040 
rocker arm falls into this knotch
allowing<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.500> air<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.970> blow<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.330> valve<00:01:33.570> open

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
allowing the air to blow the valve open

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.749 
allowing the air to blow the valve open
and<00:01:34.229> admit<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.040> into<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> bottom<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
and admit there into the bottom of the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.880 
and admit there into the bottom of the
silicon<00:01:36.450> cylinder<00:01:37.050> causing<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.830> fire<00:01:42.890> one

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
silicon cylinder causing it to fire one

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.890 
silicon cylinder causing it to fire one
of<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> nice<00:01:44.160> things<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.580> this<00:01:44.940> valve<00:01:45.509> is

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
of the nice things about this valve is

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.580 
of the nice things about this valve is
that<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> turn<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.070> air<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:48.780> doesn't

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that when you turn the air on it doesn't

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.190 
that when you turn the air on it doesn't
leak<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.160> air<00:01:50.479> right<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:51.509> I've<00:01:51.869> got<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
leak in the air right there I've got the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
leak in the air right there I've got the
air<00:01:52.320> full<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.460> hear<00:01:53.640> no<00:01:53.790> air<00:01:54.030> escaping

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
air full on you can hear no air escaping

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.440 
air full on you can hear no air escaping
whatsoever<00:01:55.100> as<00:01:56.100> soon<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.550> spin<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.850> over<00:01:57.149> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
whatsoever as soon as I spin it over it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:39.910 
whatsoever as soon as I spin it over it
it'll<00:01:57.930> start

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:05:12.230 

well<00:02:40.910> I'm<00:02:41.150> pretty<00:02:41.660> small

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.160 

and<00:05:13.240> I'm<00:05:13.420> gonna<00:05:13.510> turn<00:05:13.750> for<00:05:14.170> my<00:05:14.320> air<00:05:14.680> compressor
