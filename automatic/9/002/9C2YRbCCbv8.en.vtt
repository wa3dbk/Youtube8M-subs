change a few things I made this

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
change a few things I made this
character<00:01:26.610> he's<00:01:26.759> able<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> move<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.299> down<00:01:27.509> left

and right but if you were to open the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.569 
and right but if you were to open the
original<00:01:29.909> game<00:01:30.780> maker<00:01:30.990> file<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:32.430> would

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
original game maker file you would

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.910 
original game maker file you would
recognize<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.479> looks<00:01:33.689> exactly<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.590> same

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
recognize that it looks exactly the same

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.859 
recognize that it looks exactly the same
as<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.250> one

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
as this one

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.060 
as this one
besides<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> extra<00:01:37.290> detail<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:39.920> took<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
besides the extra detail I took the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.210 
besides the extra detail I took the
liberty<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.490> adding<00:01:41.820> some<00:01:42.329> keys<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
liberty of adding some keys and I in the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.700 
liberty of adding some keys and I in the
other<00:01:44.399> game<00:01:44.549> had<00:01:44.759> keys<00:01:45.000> too<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.780> don't

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
other game had keys too but I don't

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.230 
other game had keys too but I don't
think<00:01:46.920> he<00:01:47.009> had<00:01:47.189> doors<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.880> couldn't

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
think he had doors that you couldn't

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:59.760 
think he had doors that you couldn't
lock<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.409> key<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:50.270> could<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.570> wrong<00:01:51.720> but

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.499 

yes<00:02:00.770> occasionally<00:02:01.579> I<00:02:01.610> do<00:02:01.729> make<00:02:02.090> decent

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
yes occasionally I do make decent

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.370 
yes occasionally I do make decent
