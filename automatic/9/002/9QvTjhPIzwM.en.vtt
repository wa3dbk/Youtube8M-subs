00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.510
 a video 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.750
 make a water think they are very very 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.639
 rich and I'm not getting them and over 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.789
 the good thing is that we're not going to unleash the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.789
 test we make with the pan your rose 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.260
 It takes away the flow because it's very easy 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.109
 to be used but operative of power 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.240
 hit the yellow ones so I'm going to use 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.150
 we will need and how it is done 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.750
 a new 190 cubic centimeters of 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.530
 milk 50 grams of butter a cup of 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.070
 flour a pinch of salt and a pinch of 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.070
 vanilla essence 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.719
 break the egg into a bowl and 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.719
 we beat 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.730
 ah 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.730
 ah 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.490
 we add the milk and the essence of 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.540
 Vanilla has to be a trickle of 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.540
 vanilla essence nothing more 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.580
 and we continue beating only about 10 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.650
 seconds until they see what they see 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.950
 a few bubbles and when you have to 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.950
 stop 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.280
 the butter will remove the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:37.549
 microwave in about 10 or 15 seconds like that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.549
 and we add it to the mixture and we beat 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.890
 an answer we add batmos very 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.890
 little bit and let's see 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:10.530
 let's make niro to sift with 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:10.530
 ramis the flour and the pinch of salt 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.650
 and then with a metal spoon no longer 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.650
 blender 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.469
 ah 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.090
 ah 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.379
 Y 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.570
 mix until there is nothing left 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.570
 lumps 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.190
 I forgot to tell them add two tablespoons 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.190
 of sugar that I'm going to add 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.189
 and ready add the mixture with a spoon 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.170
 large to a Teflon pan that does not 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:34.730
 I need to keep him or anything 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.200
 and with a spatula once he invited 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.120
 the good back and as well as the 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.200
 pancakes 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.180
 you leave approximately 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.190
 that goes depends on the size at which the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.819
 do but if the eleven type pancake you 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.819
 6 depart 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.930
 all right 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.550
 notice that they are shaped like little circles 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.550
 everyone is doing that we want 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.820
 I put them on a cloth but you can 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.810
 put banana milk candy what more 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.810
 you like it 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.280
 so that third parties
