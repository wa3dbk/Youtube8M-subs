00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
a putt the way to do that is to make

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.290 
a putt the way to do that is to make
sure<00:00:42.769> you<00:00:43.010> have<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.280> correct<00:00:43.579> loft<00:00:43.940> on<00:00:44.180> your

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
sure you have the correct loft on your

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.920 
sure you have the correct loft on your
club

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
club

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.189 
club
this<00:00:45.559> shot<00:00:45.860> requires<00:00:46.309> less<00:00:46.879> loft<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:47.989> on<00:00:48.170> a

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
this shot requires less loft so on a

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.139 
this shot requires less loft so on a
short<00:00:48.559> shot<00:00:48.829> you'd<00:00:49.100> have<00:00:49.280> more<00:00:49.579> loft<00:00:49.820> like<00:00:50.089> a

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
short shot you'd have more loft like a

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.079 
short shot you'd have more loft like a
58<00:00:50.690> degree<00:00:50.989> sand<00:00:51.199> wedge<00:00:51.350> on<00:00:52.280> a<00:00:52.339> longer<00:00:52.879> shot

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
58 degree sand wedge on a longer shot

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.910 
58 degree sand wedge on a longer shot
this<00:00:53.540> would<00:00:53.750> require<00:00:54.049> less<00:00:54.110> loft<00:00:54.619> so<00:00:54.799> we're

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
this would require less loft so we're

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.649 
this would require less loft so we're
going<00:00:55.040> to<00:00:55.100> use<00:00:55.189> a<00:00:55.220> 7-iron<00:00:55.760> here's<00:00:56.479> how<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
going to use a 7-iron here's how the

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.810 
going to use a 7-iron here's how the
setup<00:00:56.960> works<00:00:57.339> first<00:00:58.339> we're<00:00:58.489> going<00:00:58.580> to<00:00:58.640> pick

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
setup works first we're going to pick

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.240

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.359 
the ball is in the center of our stance
we're<00:01:03.379> going<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.559> make<00:01:03.680> sure<00:01:03.830> that<00:01:04.009> our<00:01:04.159> weight

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
we're going to make sure that our weight

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.130 
we're going to make sure that our weight

is on our front foot and then we're
going<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:06.290> also<00:01:06.350> lean<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.189> club<00:01:07.460> shaft

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
going to also lean the club shaft

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.660 
going to also lean the club shaft
towards<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.330> target<00:01:08.750> like<00:01:09.049> this<00:01:09.520> what<00:01:10.520> we

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
towards the target like this what we

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.429 
towards the target like this what we
don't<00:01:10.850> want<00:01:11.180> is<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:11.600> don't<00:01:11.780> want<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.110> club

shaft<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:13.009> go<00:01:13.189> backwards<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.329> this<00:01:14.570> would<00:01:14.780> be

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
shaft to go backwards so this would be

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:24.090 
shaft to go backwards so this would be
bad<00:01:17.619> this<00:01:18.619> would<00:01:18.799> be<00:01:18.920> really<00:01:19.159> good
