00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.550
 second to sixth place in the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.290
 intermediate position for the wk because those four 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.420
 did not manage to score in the last one 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.269
 Cramp Reese now finished second in the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.430
 training and this is Marc de Reuver too 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.110
 he is doing very well and it is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.239
 a home game so the must what 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.669
 can happen but the most dangerous 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.860
 opponent today is steve ramon de 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.329
 Belgian often in the intermediate position for the World Cup 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.640
 because there is number 1 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.989
 James top who is already world champion 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.079
 injured himself yesterday during the 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.140
 training and is not among them 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.050
 those are the fastest trainers in Breugelmans 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.000
 and so somewhere 1 and 2 with 20 that is 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.310
 Something you pay attention goes straight forward 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.470
 next to them the numbers leuven stable mate 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.390
 koenders and he with that orange shirt 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.610
 they go first in the second turn 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.290
 patrique ups the belgian gets stuck there 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.330
 and in sixth place 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.060
 there we see marc de reuver de 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.520
 so good for you 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.780
 yes and then as always a crash 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.420
 there are now just part of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.680
 but it often doesn't have that on the sand 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.409
 too big consequences 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.259
 you see it for something for leo for 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.320
 when the sephora won for breugelmans 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.020
 and behind it was the red marc reuver 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.909
 great start to the dutch read also 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.100
 the rest in second place 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.740
 and as always there is always someone 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.750
 who falls there but those are usually the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.960
 unnamed 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.479
 somewhere takes 35 minutes 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.369
 there two dogs by the loose sand cube 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.110
 and will follow 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.690
 Marc de Reuver has already made it to 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.759
 the third place that is no over and over 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.200
 there is steve rattling 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.060
 and behind that is Kevin 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.130
 forest of the male 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.840
 second in the european championship 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.509
 scores regularly 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.149
 is still good competitions at the age of 18 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.149
 alternate with competitions in which no 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.820
 gets no points and now we are on the 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.920
 motorcycle eric somewhere to somewhere 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.410
 so had some bad matches 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.149
 beat injuries but also through wrong ones 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.649
 adjustment of the butter and maybe also 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.780
 a bit because I am in my head 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.390
 not quite right but Kees van de 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.340
 ven gives confidence in a preserved 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.040
 cees the power ven now 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.510
 factory team of ktm suffer and chose as 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.640
 first man yes 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.230
 erik eggens and second the man this 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.269
 number 11 here 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.040
 Steve Ramon so switching from that 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.040
 all of Jan de Groot's business team 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.689
 Yes 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.790
 ktm factory team of cees van de ven 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:34.939
 that will be something especially on that james 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.579
 stop new world champion this one 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.879
 urination to the shafts 250 centimeters in 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.500
 fruit and slot further and further away from it 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.530
 opponents 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.590
 more than 20 seconds ahead 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.260
 gundersen and the male 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.930
 he was made for it, but there is a skilled man 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.909
 but how close is now Marc 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.799
 male 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.870
 on this circuit where something so much altitude 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.269
 differences but from that 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.700
 table border where you have to jump 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.069
 a lot of cutting and that sand that of the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.599
 well always were six and a half 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.439
 almost the difference between 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.419
 between and the male reuver that of it 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.280
 theo team will understand something 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:19.489
 to the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.370
 ktm team that is the team so often now 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.960
 times I drive for something 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.970
 there it is 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.680
 second in ek i told you right behind 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.870
 Kevin Strijbos 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.420
 it was actually because he had a few 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.070
 mistakes made in the last race and this 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.820
 is james top and he laughs 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.280
 world champion 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.080
 he can not participate deep suffering and 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.060
 that is now the difference between doing 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.060
 eh and markets leuven 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.519
 the male can still seize the 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.560
 second place 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.629
 q so and has lately 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.060
 naturally gained a lot of experience in 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.069
 Kees van de Ven's team and will join 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.930
 don't make it beat so quickly 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.000
 the distance to erik eggens that here 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.980
 they stay behind is handsome as if they are silent 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.659
 stand 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.209
 who will be the more expensive of course 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.430
 also a slice of 9 lane for itself and will 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.319
 not really get into the white bag 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.780
 image with number 4 sydney 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.940
 That's the man who comes in third 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.489
 he stands the intermediate position for the world cup 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.669
 fell and will not be in points today 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.669
 to drive 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.470
 can be there 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.660
 and there is the slots 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.780
 but it's great like the red one 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.480
 I settled this field what this that 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.460
 nice for that 125 hp 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.350
 yes that is a different story than with 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.200
 you put heavy 500 minutes called 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.230
 motorcycles 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.420
 somewhere is unstoppable 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.750
 just as in valkenswaard, it dictates the 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.820
 checked and if you are now 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.920
 teaches he might be on hard jobs 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.900
 also something can with a remains and the 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.970
 seventh place and not always for the 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.250
 want to drive first then that's one anyway 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.350
 future world champion 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.450
 here saw thrips knee patches he becomes 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.380
 first flagged for something 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.620
 cubes 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.539
 the male ramon breugelmans and kevin 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.970
 battle forest 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.970
 delphi with a dutch license time 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.490
 can be the last meters of and so me 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.640
 now walk large between distances between the 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.590
 numbers 1 and 2 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.980
 great performance from somewhere he is 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.110
 so back he is happy and pulls and clutter 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.440
 the atmosphere here and give 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.270
 much increasing 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.430
 point loss does not want that wants of course 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.920
 the second place on this 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.340
 World of view to keep 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:42.230
 the second place he has now 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.230
 make kinrooi and listen 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.820
 so somewhere from 6 after four and the male on 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.470
 7 and how happy I am that I can 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.850
 winning for my home crowd is real 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:59.340
 is great is really yes there we are 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.970
 three four four back cramps sit on scoring zero 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.530
 And yes then this can this look like 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.810
 I had come super I trained 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.090
 have everything done for for left and 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.570
 then I win the contest I 'm so happy 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.660
 cool 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:15.570
 a little a year later 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.920
 chasing the soup let the bank back 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.720
 be inside 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.390
 and I walked over a little more me 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.270
 but i was there a green or c that is 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.580
 logical but still makes the platform last 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.060
 few mistakes could could allow them inside 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.640
 no more grabbing 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.590
 well this is just a good think again 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.060
 start for the last two times 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.720
 priest was just the key i think 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:39.210
 again and yes I am just so super happy 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.330
 so yes your life here you do it 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.330
 in front of
