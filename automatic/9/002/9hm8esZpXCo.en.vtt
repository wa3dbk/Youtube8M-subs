00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
kinds of neat pieces but I just couldn't

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.510 
kinds of neat pieces but I just couldn't
get<00:01:07.020> over<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.350> feeling<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.250> playing

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
get over the feeling that I was playing

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.960 
get over the feeling that I was playing
rock<00:01:08.970> paper<00:01:09.270> scissors<00:01:11.390> just<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.960> bit

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
rock paper scissors just a little bit

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.160 
rock paper scissors just a little bit
maybe<00:01:14.970> more<00:01:16.100> involved<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.930> know

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
maybe more involved but I don't know

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.719 
maybe more involved but I don't know
this<00:01:19.799> seems<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> kind<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.549> game<00:01:20.700> you

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
this seems like the kind of game you

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.609 
this seems like the kind of game you
would<00:01:20.909> use<00:01:21.030> maybe<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.390> determine<00:01:21.840> who<00:01:22.290> starts

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
would use maybe to determine who starts

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.700 
would use maybe to determine who starts
the<00:01:22.740> next<00:01:22.979> game<00:01:23.159> let's<00:01:24.000> look<00:01:24.210> at<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.530> one<00:01:25.530> thing

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the next game let's look at it one thing

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.170 
the next game let's look at it one thing
the<00:01:25.830> game<00:01:25.920> comes<00:01:26.220> with<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> pile<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.790> ships

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the game comes with as a pile of ships

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.230 
the game comes with as a pile of ships
really<00:01:27.420> neat<00:01:27.689> ships<00:01:28.520> they're<00:01:29.520> plastic<00:01:30.000> ships

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
really neat ships they're plastic ships

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
really neat ships they're plastic ships
and<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> snap-on<00:01:31.259> base<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.250> goes

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and they have a snap-on base that goes

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.859 
and they have a snap-on base that goes
in<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> bottom<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.030> base<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.420> important

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
in the bottom and this base is important

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.569 
in the bottom and this base is important
because<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.590> what's<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> bottom<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
because it's what's in the bottom of the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.850 
because it's what's in the bottom of the
base<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.000> matters<00:01:36.390> most<00:01:36.960> three<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.710> your

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
base that matters most three of your

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
base that matters most three of your
five<00:01:38.100> ships<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.729> nothing<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> base<00:01:39.570> of

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
five ships have nothing on the base of

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.020 
five ships have nothing on the base of
them<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.530> two<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.860> them<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.310> cannons<00:01:41.909> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
them but two of them have cannons and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.190 
them but two of them have cannons and
I'm<00:01:42.119> not<00:01:42.210> even<00:01:42.329> sure<00:01:42.450> you'll<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.810> able<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.020> see

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
I'm not even sure you'll be able to see

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.109 
I'm not even sure you'll be able to see
this<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> video<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.399> I'll<00:01:44.729> wave<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:44.970> back

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
this on the video but I'll wave it back

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.249 
this on the video but I'll wave it back
and<00:01:45.420> forth<00:01:45.570> maybe<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and forth maybe you can see the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.380 
and forth maybe you can see the
silhouette<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.490> cannon<00:01:47.909> there<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.240> those

has<00:03:39.440> pulled<00:03:39.710> other<00:03:39.860> treasure<00:03:40.190> cards<00:03:40.550> off<00:03:40.700> the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
has pulled other treasure cards off the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.750 
has pulled other treasure cards off the
board<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.240> or<00:03:41.750> have<00:03:41.990> stolen<00:03:42.320> them<00:03:42.560> from

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
board and or have stolen them from

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.460 
board and or have stolen them from
everybody<00:03:43.760> else<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.570> that's<00:03:44.750> basically<00:03:45.230> the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
everybody else so that's basically the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.830 
everybody else so that's basically the
way<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:45.800> game<00:03:45.980> works<00:03:46.310> you<00:03:46.550> can<00:03:46.700> see<00:03:46.880> how<00:03:47.360> it's

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
way that game works you can see how it's

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.720 
way that game works you can see how it's
kind<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.530> simple<00:03:48.830> in<00:03:49.100> a<00:03:49.130> sense<00:03:49.400> you're<00:03:49.580> just

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
kind of simple in a sense you're just

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.700 
kind of simple in a sense you're just
putting<00:03:49.880> your<00:03:50.390> gonna<00:03:50.570> guard<00:03:51.050> two<00:03:51.440> of<00:03:51.560> your

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
putting your gonna guard two of your

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.140 
putting your gonna guard two of your
treasure<00:03:51.950> cards<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.520> your<00:03:52.730> opponents<00:03:53.090> are

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
treasure cards and your opponents are

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.850 
treasure cards and your opponents are
trying<00:03:53.210> to<00:03:53.510> guess<00:03:53.780> which<00:03:54.350> of<00:03:54.380> your<00:03:54.650> treasure

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
trying to guess which of your treasure

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.580 
trying to guess which of your treasure
cards<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.640> are<00:03:55.670> guarding<00:03:56.360> at<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.260> end<00:03:57.380> again

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
cards you are guarding at the end again

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.720 
cards you are guarding at the end again
you're<00:03:57.800> gonna<00:03:57.890> add<00:03:58.010> up<00:03:58.040> all<00:03:58.310> your<00:03:58.340> treasure

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
you're gonna add up all your treasure

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.310 
you're gonna add up all your treasure
and<00:03:59.030> you'll<00:03:59.120> add<00:03:59.240> up<00:03:59.390> each<00:03:59.540> cannon<00:04:00.020> car<00:04:00.170> that

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
and you'll add up each cannon car that

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.960 
and you'll add up each cannon car that
you've<00:04:00.440> stolen<00:04:00.650> counts<00:04:01.430> as<00:04:01.520> one<00:04:01.670> victory

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
you've stolen counts as one victory

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.280 
you've stolen counts as one victory
point<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.390> so<00:04:02.510> you'll<00:04:02.660> find<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:02.960> scores

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
point and so you'll find that scores

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.380 
point and so you'll find that scores
were<00:04:03.440> often<00:04:03.680> very<00:04:03.710> close<00:04:04.040> like<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.910> know<00:04:05.000> 18

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
were often very close like you know 18

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.170 
were often very close like you know 18
to<00:04:05.480> 17<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:05.960> 16<00:04:06.200> something<00:04:06.680> like<00:04:06.830> that<00:04:07.180> so

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
to 17 and 16 something like that so

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.270 
to 17 and 16 something like that so
you're<00:04:08.300> trying<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.540> guess<00:04:08.810> where<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.950> put<00:04:10.190> the

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
you're trying to guess where you put the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.580 
you're trying to guess where you put the
ships<00:04:10.550> so<00:04:11.390> I<00:04:11.420> put<00:04:11.630> that<00:04:11.780> my<00:04:11.930> card<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.380> I<00:04:12.410> look

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
ships so I put that my card and I look

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.400 
ships so I put that my card and I look
and<00:04:12.740> I<00:04:12.800> say<00:04:12.950> okay<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.760> just<00:04:13.790> put<00:04:14.120> down<00:04:14.240> a7<00:04:15.080> chip

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
and I say okay you just put down a7 chip

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.610 
and I say okay you just put down a7 chip
now<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.549> know<00:04:16.870> that<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.560> will<00:04:18.799> guard<00:04:19.160> that<00:04:19.850> ship

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
now I know that you will guard that ship

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.340 
now I know that you will guard that ship
with<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.859> cannon<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:22.460> clearly<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.510> cannot<00:04:24.020> attack

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
with a cannon so clearly I cannot attack

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.270 
with a cannon so clearly I cannot attack
that<00:04:24.590> ship<00:04:24.890> but<00:04:25.880> you

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
that ship but you

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.460 
that ship but you
know<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:27.120> I'm<00:04:27.210> going<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.510> attack<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.139> ship

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
know that I'm going to attack that ship

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.410 
know that I'm going to attack that ship
or<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.740> won't<00:04:29.220> attack<00:04:29.430> that<00:04:29.639> ship<00:04:29.850> so<00:04:30.270> you're

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
or I won't attack that ship so you're

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.550 
or I won't attack that ship so you're
going<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.690> think<00:04:30.990> that<00:04:31.020> I'm<00:04:31.200> gonna<00:04:31.320> attack

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
going to think that I'm gonna attack

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.290 
going to think that I'm gonna attack
your<00:04:31.680> three<00:04:31.950> ships<00:04:32.160> so<00:04:32.340> you're<00:04:32.880> gonna<00:04:33.000> put<00:04:33.180> the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
your three ships so you're gonna put the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.480 
your three ships so you're gonna put the
cannon<00:04:33.600> on<00:04:33.720> your<00:04:33.870> three<00:04:34.110> ship<00:04:34.350> so<00:04:34.770> clearly<00:04:35.160> I

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
cannon on your three ship so clearly I

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.540 
cannon on your three ship so clearly I
can't<00:04:35.940> attack<00:04:36.240> your<00:04:36.630> three<00:04:36.960> ship<00:04:37.200> however<00:04:37.650> you

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
can't attack your three ship however you

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.300 
can't attack your three ship however you
know<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:39.210> know<00:04:39.530> that<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:40.800> will<00:04:41.010> do<00:04:41.280> that

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
know that I know that you will do that

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.480 
know that I know that you will do that
and<00:04:41.840> well<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:43.790> think<00:04:44.790> we're<00:04:45.060> stalling<00:04:45.360> now<00:04:46.490> the

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
and well I think we're stalling now the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.580 
and well I think we're stalling now the
fact<00:04:47.700> of<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.910> matter<00:04:47.940> is<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:49.080> really<00:04:49.380> don't

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
fact of the matter is you really don't

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.159 
fact of the matter is you really don't
know<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.040> it's<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.669> matter<00:04:50.940> of<00:04:51.060> out<00:04:51.510> guessing

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
know and it's a matter of out guessing

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.320 
know and it's a matter of out guessing
the<00:04:52.590> other<00:04:52.770> person<00:04:53.160> out<00:04:53.310> guessing<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:54.180> other

the other person out guessing the other
person<00:04:54.690> out<00:04:54.750> guessing<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.290> it's<00:04:55.380> very<00:04:55.590> just

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
person out guessing and it's very just

close<00:05:10.080> game<00:05:10.320> sessions<00:05:10.650> with<00:05:10.770> it<00:05:10.860> we'll<00:05:10.980> use

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
close game sessions with it we'll use

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.190 
close game sessions with it we'll use
this<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.940> figure<00:05:12.270> out<00:05:12.450> who<00:05:12.690> starts<00:05:13.080> each

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
this to to figure out who starts each

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.400 
this to to figure out who starts each
game<00:05:13.500> but<00:05:14.340> for<00:05:14.490> me<00:05:14.700> it<00:05:15.150> was<00:05:15.210> just<00:05:15.660> too<00:05:15.990> little

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
game but for me it was just too little

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.130 
game but for me it was just too little
of<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:17.100> game<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.940> really<00:05:18.240> be<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.570> interesting
