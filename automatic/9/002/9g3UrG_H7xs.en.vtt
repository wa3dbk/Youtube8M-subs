00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.670
 the popularity of such mob giants as lol 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.860
 and dota 2 does not give rest to many 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.960
 developers and therefore periodically 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.109
 new projects appear 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.359
 This genre already has about superheroes and 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.689
 about heroes warcraft healed and about 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.519
 gods and still know about pants mostly 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.380
 no matter how cool all these games are for the most part 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.560
 account copy the mechanics of the first dota 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.960
 so that there would not say lola fans but this 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.690
 so the character scenery only changes 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.550
 here's the famous big point company 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.770
 decided to join this case 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.430
 come up a little on the other side 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.559
 connecting his mark elites and dota we creed 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.780
 in fact it was quite a good project but 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.850
 she did not earn much love 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.989
 so the game was remade in more 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.670
 popular format 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.800
 of course yes of popularity and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.870
 elaboration of the leading mob projects 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.850
 chances wars certainly does not reach but 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.430
 it is not very far behind 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.260
 before the content in the game is still small but it 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.910
 and no wonder before the release is still very 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.910
 far and therefore everything is ahead 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.659
 now we proceed directly to 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.039
 the battle where as in the menu at first 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.229
 all look familiar 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.020
 two bases three lines with protective 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.030
 constructions creeps and neutrals but in practice 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.219
 a lot of differences and the first thing that catches 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.770
 the eyes are what the qi ball is for 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.619
 sci-fi top-down shooter in the scenery 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.280
 mob i.e. magicians no no elves and orcs 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.979
 and gnomes 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.530
 stork lasers machine guns and robots one 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.750
 word future character management 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.369
 done using the keyboard like 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.220
 in crimsonland or alien shooter 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.500
 but we aim with the mouse and shoot the second 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.599
 the difference is the lack of play store in 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.549
 any way his third opportunity 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.739
 become sick not only at the base 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.959
 first aid kits are scattered throughout 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:02.149
 map level four is not here 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.679
 individual and team is the same 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.739
 heroes august system 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.599
 5 if you kill her main trawl anal 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.640
 the pea or baron of all known 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.610
 games then he will join the player 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.440
 moving along the midway to the enemy base it 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.569
 all combined with the unusual for 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.400
 such a genre management give a very 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.530
 dynamic gameplay that can 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.810
 tighten your paws for a long time and 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.810
 which many have already delayed 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.049
 experience accrued at the end of the party and 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.150
 money and resources at this moment and 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.700
 the following difference is revealed though 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.980
 shops battle and no but things are all 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.659
 still there with every fourth level 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.090
 A selection window appears which items 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.920
 you can put on a character who in his 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.739
 queue need to create in special 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.870
 menus for these same resources are obtained 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.090
 that everything is tied to the number of victories 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.950
 depends on the speed of creating things from 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.410
 the number of useful things available 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.670
 depends on the number of victories well and plus need 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.670
 have straight arms 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.629
 one more plus of the game is the integrity of the world 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.000
 if the rest of the mobs have long been 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.920
 hotbed of freaks of all colors and stripes 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.930
 then the developers from big point try 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.250
 keep within the plot and not 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.310
 turn everything into a circus 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.010
 there are no half fat people huge mats 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.709
 spiders and slugs with gills you're not here 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.230
 see all the heroes of normal people a bit 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.260
 brutal little pretentious but some 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.239
 present and to find out who is steeper they 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.489
 use the achievements of the present 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.349
 therefore leave tracks from 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.310
 shell funnels from grenades and a piece 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:01.190
 scrap metal heroes themselves are called 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.079
 guardians and are guests from different 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.390
 parallel worlds which access 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.819
 scientists accidentally discovered some of them 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.950
 seek to close the gates of others to seize 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.569
 the remaining shards and the third are 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.459
 representatives of the land and try 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.829
 calm and first and second 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.840
 well and since the destruction of devastation 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.090
 everything and everything for man is common 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.440
 all these ambitions turned violent 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.889
 war in the vast 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.660
 empire city at the moment 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.789
 only upsets the choice of these 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.280
 characters are simply criminally few 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:34.100
 it’s good that everyone’s skills are very different 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.260
 There is the installation of the turret and lechilka and even 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.470
 air strike but here to get 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.530
 one of them must try hard 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.630
 prices bite and finances do not flow in 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.910
 this moment comes to the rescue 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.669
 where the goal is basically murder 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.950
 or causing damage that is to the fact that 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.720
 principle so to do for the schedule 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.669
 meets the unity engine which is already more than once 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.919
 showed his flexibility therefore in terms of 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.780
 the pictures look good 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.419
 as mentioned earlier in the game all 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.530
 habitual lobby card game task 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.780
 distribution system 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.000
 individuality does not shine fritupley with 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.849
 Donat view buying any nishtyakov 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.210
 type of skins in the charter or heroes true 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.460
 Heroes can be bought for game currency 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.539
 to whom 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.539
 how convenient
