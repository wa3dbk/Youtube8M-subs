00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the condition was so difficult that when

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.629

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
difficult to be confident to be at the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.279

two last stages were cancelled what was

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.770 
two last stages were cancelled what was
yours<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.550> Daniel's<00:00:35.969> reaction<00:00:36.420> at<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> time

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
yours and Daniel's reaction at a time

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.340 
yours and Daniel's reaction at a time
when<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.079> found<00:00:37.230> out<00:00:38.719> for<00:00:39.719> me<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.170> was

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
when you found out for me it was

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.650 
when you found out for me it was
impossible<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.920> go<00:00:41.129> again<00:00:41.399> because<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.510> whole

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
impossible to go again because the whole

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.069 
impossible to go again because the whole
section<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.730> it<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.910> lot<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.120> cars<00:00:45.480> of

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
section was a it was a lot of cars of

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.709 
section was a it was a lot of cars of
spectator<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.160> whole<00:00:47.280> section<00:00:47.640> was<00:00:48.510> quite

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
spectator on the whole section was quite

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.510 
spectator on the whole section was quite
sure<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.379> impossible<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.980> cross<00:00:50.280> them

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
sure that it's impossible to cross them

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.600 
sure that it's impossible to cross them
and<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.149> go<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.570> Stars<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.469> secret<00:00:53.219> was

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and to go to the Stars or a secret was

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.310 
and to go to the Stars or a secret was
the<00:00:53.730> right<00:00:53.879> decision<00:00:53.910> because<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.989> would<00:00:55.170> have

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the right decision because it would have

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.520 
the right decision because it would have
been<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:56.840> complicated<00:00:57.840> because<00:00:58.140> I'm

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
been really complicated because I'm

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.889 
been really complicated because I'm
quite<00:00:58.920> short<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> car<00:01:00.120> will<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.570> stuck

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
quite short with the car will be stuck

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.660 
quite short with the car will be stuck
down<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.960> knew<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> best<00:01:04.439> decision

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
down so I knew it's the best decision

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.620 
down so I knew it's the best decision
throughout<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> week<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> conditions<00:01:06.540> were

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
throughout the week the conditions were

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.969 
throughout the week the conditions were
pretty<00:01:06.810> intense<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:07.290> there<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.710> describe

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
pretty intense out there just describe

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
pretty intense out there just describe
what<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.280> actually<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> car<00:01:09.299> when

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
what it's actually like in the car when

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
what it's actually like in the car when
you're<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.110> along<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.439> Carmody<00:01:10.680> see

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you're going along with Carmody see

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.970 
you're going along with Carmody see
where<00:01:10.979> you're<00:01:11.070> going

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
where you're going

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.130 
where you're going

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
I think we feel a bit better than

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.830 
I think we feel a bit better than
outside<00:01:14.470> because<00:01:14.860> I've<00:01:15.640> said<00:01:15.910> you<00:01:16.060> are<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.570> was

really cold and but the condition were

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.110 
really cold and but the condition were
really<00:01:20.440> tricky<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.980> visibility<00:01:21.760> was<00:01:21.940> not

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
really tricky the visibility was not

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.200 
really tricky the visibility was not
great<00:01:22.440> it<00:01:23.440> was<00:01:23.650> full<00:01:23.890> of<00:01:23.920> snow<00:01:24.190> really<00:01:24.940> sleepy
