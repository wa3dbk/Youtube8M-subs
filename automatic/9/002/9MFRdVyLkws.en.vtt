 separatist he has already taken off 2 flags hanging on 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.290
 their territory is not our Ukrainian junior 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.760

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.380

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.780

 at this stage, that is, no matter how 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.140

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.520
