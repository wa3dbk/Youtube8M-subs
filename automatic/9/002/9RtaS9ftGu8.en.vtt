00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
tiles actually join together we're going

tiles actually join together we're going
to<00:00:37.290> take<00:00:37.469> our<00:00:37.680> tool<00:00:37.890> place<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.059> right<00:00:39.300> into<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
to take our tool place it right into the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.639 
to take our tool place it right into the
seam<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.469> tiles<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:42.020> tap<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.200> down<00:00:43.379> till

seam of the tiles and tap it down till

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.380 
seam of the tiles and tap it down till
we<00:00:43.739> get<00:00:43.920> underneath<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.489> tile<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.149> little

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
we get underneath the tile just a little

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.260 
we get underneath the tile just a little
bit<00:00:49.250> after<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.430> under<00:00:50.670> there<00:00:50.820> go<00:00:51.180> ahead

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
bit after you get under there go ahead

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.229 
bit after you get under there go ahead
and<00:00:51.390> pry<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.899> up

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
and pry it up

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.729 
and pry it up
the<00:00:54.239> reason<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.600> didn't<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.110> bang<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.620> in

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the reason we didn't just bang it in

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.470 
the reason we didn't just bang it in
there<00:00:55.920> try<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> rip<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> tile<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.090> fast<00:00:57.300> as

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
there try to rip all the tile as fast as

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.299 
there try to rip all the tile as fast as
possible<00:00:57.960> because<00:00:58.260> we're<00:00:58.649> trying<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.039> save

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
possible because we're trying to save

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.000 
possible because we're trying to save
the<00:00:59.340> wood<00:00:59.699> floor<00:01:00.000> underneath<00:01:00.649> so<00:01:01.649> after<00:01:01.920> you

get it under there

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.179 
get it under there
go<00:01:03.690> ahead<00:01:03.930> take<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.379> hammer<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.070> can
