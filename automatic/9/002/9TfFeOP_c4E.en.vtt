00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.370
 moin moin in this video I'm watching 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.780
 The handgun is the word closer to her 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.910
 can the revolver from the red cross 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.509
 end difficult difficulty 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.710
 to get 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.360
 compare the weapon with the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.640
 popular fate spring from the raid 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.529
 glass chamber as well as the exotic one 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.419
 weapon tors the word in large 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.489
 exotic brother not only visually 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.989
 but not in the handling 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.869
 First, a look at the upgrades 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.180
 cras the word tomorrow 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.820
 weapons modification teaching damage 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.370
 that means the kur in purple swede like 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.359
 that of praetorians especially effective 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.359
 can break through 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.989
 springer instead has a markus 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.359
 modification against blue damage thorn 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.570
 on the other hand, it does not cause any elemental damage 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.570
 With 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.359
 in the first upgrade blog you adjust yours 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.920
 visor followed by a stability 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.920
 castle and damage bonus 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.019
 in the subsequent demolition hits one 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.610
 Not an easy choice you can do that 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.409
 reload speed increase 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.630
 reach and improve precision or 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.610
 exclusive bullets he choose this 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.470
 Explosive bullets are not around 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.420
 exploding to be confused as well 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.640
 destiny brings you with precision 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.009
 Instead, the acts trigger 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.479
 projectile like small explosive charge and 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.720
 distribute damage over a small one 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.720
 surface 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.750
 that will hurt for that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.369
 actual goal, however, weakened 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.979
 That's why I increase the range 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.360
 or the loading speed 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.560
 prefer you see her now in 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.479
 pictorial comparison the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.009
 Loading speed of God's word with 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.690
 activated work and without 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.369
 speed bonus as well as the 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.700
 speed of thorns fate 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.700
 bring 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.250
 dix bring that when loading on 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.900
 slowest as it may seem 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.670
 speed but significantly increase 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.620
 if you meet for a precise and 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.040
 is unbeaten in these cases 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.040
 fast 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.489
 furthermore, the word neighbor a micro 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.080
 pretty tough affair 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.000
 I personally prefer the snow 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.040
 Recharge space even if he only 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.540
 has a rather small effect 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.099
 the range compared to fate 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.780
 Bring one of the three in one 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.640
 Bring excellent handling and 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.049
 goals from the extended separation very much 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.049
 is very safe 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.000
 the citation with gothas word 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.310
 total some getting used to if 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.090
 still getting used to a ce already 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.090
 is at thorn 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.700
 an interesting point of god's word 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.230
 is the phantom gift if you 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.970
 Three times faster, a goal follows precisely 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.129
 wears here a round ins 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.209
 back with a tremendous magazine 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.180
 Do not play for a full magazine 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.190
 but a single ball was not 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.510
 just the world and on top sap grc 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.099
 at the time of this video still 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.780
 flawed as soon as the next 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.430
 update blog hurt the bonus 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.690
 Spanish enabled this works 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.180
 phantom gift is not quite right anymore 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.890
 against strong opponents with the yellow 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.599
 health both the ground should 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.430
 therein are that the bonus as 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.290
 hits the body and the series 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.700
 interrupts is that ammunition 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.140
 gift but actually necessary because in 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.329
 Contrary to many other weapons there 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.829
 it's the word no magazine upgrade 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.349
 bring fate comes with the 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.349
 corresponding uphill up to 13 balls 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.440
 magazine and 104 balls in reserve thorn 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:46.019
 on 9 magazine and 68 reserve balls and 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.140
 co word on twelve bullets in the magazine 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.450
 and 67 years reserve after the 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.459
 complete upgrade of the weapon to 331 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.319
 Attack points is about practice 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.069
 about fate springer this one 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.569
 respect of 300 thorns of 331 points and 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.630
 to use is as usual a 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.230
 Character at level 32 when attacking 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.810
 a rising sharp the cdu the word 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.560
 642 points cause damage and 408 points 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.560
 damage bonus 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.229
 ski jumper comes against the same knight 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.540
 on 627 thorns on six month damage 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.310
 points 95 doing additional damage 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.560
 Noteworthy over time is the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.340
 minimum distance to 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.500
 bring powerful fate 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.600
 how to grow on an adversary without 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.550
 Template damage looks gorgeous 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.169
 it is that actually proves what 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.820
 an excellent weapon fate 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.960
 bringer is still because of the 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.669
 different damage 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.650
 modifications are also being tested 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.380
 effect of trotha sword went purple and 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.660
 fate bringer against blue scheele 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.600
 about the same size majors measure 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.570
 patrol and tell against - with great 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.389
 sword 610 points stands to harm with 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.550
 Fate even fights 683 against 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.870
 this hp major what it looks like 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.970
 destinies bring against the right ones 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.550
 Heavy even more effective and come with it 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.070
 I conclude that the word is suitable 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.380
 good against the talk of fine as minutes 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.840
 or praetorian and neatly straightens 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.070
 bonus against strong opponents 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.050
 otherwise it will hurt a lot 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.130
 disappointing reach and handling 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.050
 are overgrown the 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.970
 Charging speed is tough and that 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.160
 ammunition gift at precise hits 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.289
 falls rather stingily from the moment 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.210
 also still faulty magazines ball 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.560
 reserve are not upgrade at and 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.080
 especially in comparison to fate 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.150
 I'm downright tiny overall 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.979
 I glad the word rather disappoints the 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.789
 Weapon it only for narrowly defined tasks 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.840
 to recommend 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.090
 thorn is in most situations 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.520
 stronger than the word, however, proves 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.970
 a valuable exotic weapons slot 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.320
 that without causing elemental damage 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.849
 sent springer possession prepares 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.130
 best the weapon because she is mine 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.990
 Consider among the tested 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.000
 Candidates the best all-rounder and 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.470
 shines with exploding opponents and 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.450
 an outstanding loading speed 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.070
 with well placed hits 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.840
 even the damage can be done despite the 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.520
 lower attacked Swertz still 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.470
 let see because they are with the weapons 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.350
 similar or other experience collected 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.000
 you can have a comment 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.650
 I hope that this overview 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.690
 helped me and thank you for that 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.690
 watching makes it good and sometimes
