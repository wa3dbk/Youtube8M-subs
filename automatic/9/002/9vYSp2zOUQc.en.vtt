single<00:02:18.360> 12<00:02:18.630> volt<00:02:18.870> rail<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:21.780> could<00:02:21.960> put<00:02:22.080> a

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
single 12 volt rail so you could put a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.500 
single 12 volt rail so you could put a
pretty<00:02:22.350> beefy<00:02:22.530> car<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.700> you're<00:02:24.420> not

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
pretty beefy car in with that you're not

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.220 
pretty beefy car in with that you're not
going<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.720> get<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.430> 770<00:02:26.430> or<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.060> 780<00:02:27.630> or
