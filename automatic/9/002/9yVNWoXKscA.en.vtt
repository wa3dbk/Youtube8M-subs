00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
IN HEALTH NEWS - A MAJOR

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
BREAKTHROUGH FOR A COMMON

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
INJURY -- DEVELOPED BY A U-

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
CONN BIO-ENGINEER.  IT'S

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
ESTIMATED A HALF MILLION

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
PEOPLE WILL TEAR THEIR A-C-L

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
THIS YEAR.  NEWS 8 MEDICAL

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
REPORTER JOCELYN MAMINTA FOUND

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
OUT ABOUT AN INNOVATIVE WAY --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
THAT COULD SOON BE USED TO

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
TREAT PATIENTS.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
SONIA-DARREN -- THE A-C-L IS

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
THE MAIN LIGAMENT THAT

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
STABILIZES THE KNEE. THE ROAD

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
TO RECOVERY FROM A TORN A-C-L

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
CAN BE DIFFICULT.   THROUGH

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
TISSUE ENGINEERING -- THERE

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
COULD BE A BETTER ALTERNATIVE.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
HEIDI GOLDEN TORE THE A-C-L IN

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
HER RIGHT KNEE.    "I

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
HYPER-EXTENDED MY KNEE AND I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
HEARD LIKE A SNAP AND THAT WAS

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
IT."  FOUR MONTHS AFTER

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"WE HAD A CADAVER ACL. I CHOSE

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
TO DO THAT OVER THE OTHER

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
METHODS AVAILABLE AND

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
BASICALLY HE STRUNG A NEW

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
TENDON BETWEEN MY LOWER LEG

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
BONE AND UPPER LEG ONE." HEIDI

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
IS ON THE TOUGH ROAD TO

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
RECOVERY -- WHICH CAN TAKE UP

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
TO A YEAR FOR MOST PATIENTS.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
"WE USE THIS THREE

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
DIMENSIONAL HIEARCHIAL

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
STRUCTURE THAT'S HOW WE

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
DESIGNED IT." ANOTHER CHOICE

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
-- DEVELOPED BY BIO-ENGINEER

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
DR. CATO LAURENCIN AT U-CONN

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
HEALTH CENTER COULD CUT DOWN

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
ON REHAB TIME.   FOR THE FIRST

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
TIME -- A COMPLETE

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
REGENERATION OF A-C-L --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
THROUGH TISSUE ENGINEERING.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
IT BEGINS WITH A MATRIX --

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"IT'S A SYNTHETIC POLYMER."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
THAT ALLOWS CELLS TO ATTACH

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
AND GROW.   "ONCE ITS

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
IMPLANTED IN THE  BODY, WE

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
COUNT ON THE BODY'S OWN

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
HEALING CAPACITY TO START TO

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
WORK TOO.  SO THE CELLS THAT

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
ACTUALLY REGENERATE THE ACL

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
ACTUALLY COME FROM THE JOINT

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
ITSELF."      SO FAR POSITIVE

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
OUTCOMES FROM ANIMAL MODELS.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
BENEFITS FOR HUMANS ARE

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
PROMISING."WE'RE SOMETIMES

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
PROTECTED OF THE KNEE BECAUSE

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
OF THE FACT MECHANICAL

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
PROPERTIES AREN'T STRONG

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
ENOUGH FOR THE ACL BUT NOW

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
WE'LL HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
ABLE TO REHAB THE KNEE EVEN

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
FASTER AND GET THE KNEE EVEN

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
MOVING FASTER."   EARLY NEXT

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
YEAR -- HUMAN TRIALS WILL

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
BEGIN IN EUROPE.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
DR. LAURENCIN TELLS ME --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
THERE'S MORE TO THE

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
REGENERATIVE TISSUE PROCESS.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
IT CAN BE APPLIED TO REPAIRING

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
OTHER SOFT TISSUES SUCH AS THE

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
ROTATOR CUFF.   HE IS LOOKING

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
TO BEGIN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
ON THAT -- SOON HERE IN THE
