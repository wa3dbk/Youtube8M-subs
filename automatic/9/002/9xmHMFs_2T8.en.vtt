00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.230
 hello everyone my name is and friends 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.350
 welcome to more night in this 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.360
 opportunity let's paint that one of 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.240
 the ten main techniques of art 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.060
 with wheat is one of the most important 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.820
 they are called floats we are going to work 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.369
 on top of a piece of mdf 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.279
 some m is here we already want in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.890
 advance what is the white base and the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:38.700
 secondary tone let's paint some 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.810
 that the zebra has in the middle of the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.280
 full technique 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.090
 in that 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.410
 in which we will place the color 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.480
 indicated in the corresponding area 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.300
 painting in one direction 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.240
 without crossing brushstrokes this for not 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.450
 cause marks 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.560
 in the project that we are banks and that 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.560
 we are on too 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.040
 we are removing the 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.090
 as a critic 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.090
 i 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.480
 but let's go painting what are the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.480
 hairline 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.450
 Y 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.930
 let's use a beveled brush in 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.310
 this opportunity number 0 we are going to 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.540
 adjust the brush according to the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.540
 pieces that we are going to use 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.580
 as the small piece as some we go 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.150
 to have a little water and we're going to 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.170
 lighten the paint a little bit in the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.170
 ink consistency 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.010
 two 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.060
 let's use the long side of the 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.300
 Brush 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.400
 we are going to load with paintings only the 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.150
 puntita 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.560
 the long little plants will then walk 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.490
 the brush 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.020
 we reload the woman 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.670
 when loading 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.170
 until they do not know a line as much 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.540
 clean possible 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.580
 let's float with the black tone that 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.920
 everything that messed up so much so 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.920
 let's do it very carefully 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.810
 to float let's use the brush 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.390
 the brush saw into the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.750
 project and we're going to go through all the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.750
 orillite 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.560
 after 15 the brush should be 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.020
 always number and we're going to be careful 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.530
 It must be a brush every time we go 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.459
 to rub load and walk 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.459
 routed 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:08.670
 the float technique 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.670
 what is going to make a deep line 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.450
 that is going to cause a degradation towards 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.340
 inside the piece and will make the 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.340
 mark that the line is not 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.310
 when you see that the float 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.870
 marked that they vomit a lot the color 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.670
 you got to wet the brush and go to 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.490
 happen again 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.490
 to clean excess 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.300
 with the color black always tends to 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.300
 happen 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.229
 now what 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.199
 we will also be floating in the area 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.199
 white 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.300
 let's move the piece 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.120
 a position where I eat 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.700
 or not 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.700
 ah 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.490
 do not 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.490
 like little fools of the world 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:02.780
 and we have our cells ready 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.669
 you see that with these two techniques so 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.940
 simple can make your first 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:10.550
 story begins to give thanks for 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.180
 your attention and we hope you have 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.180
 draft
