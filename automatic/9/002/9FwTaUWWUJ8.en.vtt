fast

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.359 
fast
yeah<00:01:02.780> creatine<00:01:03.780> has<00:01:03.930> no<00:01:04.140> calories<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.799> yeah

outside of your eating window but I

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.429 
outside of your eating window but I

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
think it's best to take it while you're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.039 
think it's best to take it while you're
getting<00:01:13.740> calories<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.760> yeah<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.540> if<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.780> even

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
it there four or five times to load up

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.600 
it there four or five times to load up
on<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.870> that's<00:02:54.020> fine<00:02:54.230> yeah<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.160> know<00:02:55.310> you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
on it that's fine yeah you know you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.970 
on it that's fine yeah you know you
don't<00:02:55.760> have<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.210> is<00:02:56.330> not<00:02:56.480> necessary<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.530> know

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
don't have to is not necessary you know

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.260 
don't have to is not necessary you know
but<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:59.360> just<00:02:59.390> speeds<00:02:59.810> up<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.140> results<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:01.270> you

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
but it just speeds up the results so you

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.790 
but it just speeds up the results so you
could<00:03:02.660> take<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.930> during<00:03:03.140> eating<00:03:03.410> window

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
could take it during eating window

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.710 
could take it during eating window
outside<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.370> eating<00:03:04.580> window<00:03:04.880> yeah<00:03:05.180> creatine

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
outside of eating window yeah creatine

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.480 
outside of eating window yeah creatine
has<00:03:05.840> no<00:03:06.080> calories<00:03:06.320> yeah<00:03:06.740> but<00:03:07.070> I<00:03:07.100> think<00:03:07.220> it's

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
has no calories yeah but I think it's

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.200 
has no calories yeah but I think it's
best<00:03:07.760> shut<00:03:08.360> up<00:03:08.680> take<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.920> yeah<00:03:10.250> why<00:03:10.730> are<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:11.030> no

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
best shut up take it yeah why are you no
