 dear delhi and of course let's see 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.879
 what procedure do we have to do to make 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.559
 you can do it via telephone 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.899
 as I told him a little while ago in the advance of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.180
 our day I'm going to start doing this 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.610
 astonished 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 start preparing for the day of the 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.510
 Candelaria I'm going to make a pai of so bad 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.870
 with pork and marinade that is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.910
 spectacular is the same but it is not 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.920
 wrong but in a country then also 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.360
 much easier to prepare we will 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.280
 remove a little less time than 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.750
 make tamales but good not for this 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.430
 because the judge I have a great one is 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.860
 so let the tamales our tamales 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.540
 of chorizo ​​that are spectacular and 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.270
 well let's start doing state 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.869
 of container cajeta let's put 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.869
 milk 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.000
 let's put evaporated milk to lose 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.000
 my stove 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.180
 and I'm going to put the cajeta 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.410
 and there's nothing like the cajeta 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.830
 Many people have told me what 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.840
 difference between the cajeta and the 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.880
 sweet the dulce de leche this sweet of 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.070
 Milk is very Argentine surely 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.890
 you know it and you have seen it 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.670
 what is the difference many times is not 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.190
 cajeta not the dulce de leche the Argentine 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.060
 that we have tried on some occasions 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.970
 is made from cow's milk if the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.370
 Cajeta is made with milk from 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.580
 goat then it 's pretty pretty 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.750
 different has nothing to do with each 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.310
 the other 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.350
 we are going to take this to here I do not lie 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.460
 here I have my sorry excuse where I'm going to 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.700
 dissolve my starch 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:35.800
 of corn that the starch of corn I want 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.820
 to say that it's not cornstarch is that it's more 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.470
 bq the corn is ready and I have here 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.820
 list a cinnamon stick that had 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.930
 that of a plastic and here is ready 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.930
 let's go with this for here 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.980
 and I'm going to make an atole of amaranth that 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.170
 I thought it was spectacular to do it myself 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.110
 that the cajeta is perfectly dissolved 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.980
 I'm going to put the starch and hard I'm going to 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.980
 put a cinnamon stick 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.430
 ok do not need sugar now let's 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.159
 mix coconut milk coconut milk 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.879
 You can find it in the super here 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.879
 I have coconut milk 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.650
 it's not that water is a water lime 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.940
 drink that is used to make drinks 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.170
 and cocktails very well but thank you 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.170
 let's put milk 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.700
 and I'm going to use amaranth flour 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.530
 amaranth flour the alcohol is 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.400
 get in naturist stores what 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.400
 there is balloon engine 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.939
 here we are others of pride is the one that 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:49.000
 will help me to integrate air 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.769
 and that I do not get lumps here is not going to 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.900
 carry any type of starch because 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:57.180
 because flour is a natural thickener 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.700
 it is very important before it 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.400
 hot undo all the lumps that 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.030
 there is an atole of amaranth with coconut that 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.030
 it's great 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.819
 let's leave it to these we can see that 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.720
 not a single group remains but the pep and 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.720
 I no longer have lumps 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.350
 we are going to put sugar in this moment 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.350
 the sugar will be according to your taste 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:32.520
 we mix we will put a short 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.520
 cinnamon also once I'll put it 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.390
 I like to open it and that's a kind of 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.360
 cinnamon 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.820
 good is cinnamon is a bark of a 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.040
 tree you have to open it very well I'm going to 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.310
 tell what happens there are many limitations 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.780
 of cinnamon and I will tell you why 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.130
 the kilo of cinnamon is in 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.380
 approximately 900 pesos 900 but it 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.630
 Write Carlos, this does not weigh even a 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.120
 Gram well despite a gram the best 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.980
 with luck and that has a cost of 9 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.890
 cents to the best talking about 900 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.320
 weights but unfortunately they are not 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.910
 selling cat hare then it is 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.650
 very important that you are going to buy 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.620
 in an open place in the in the 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.140
 mercadito for example if you ask and the 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.620
 grandmother has with panela what she smelled 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.960
 before the cinnamon does not smell like what 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.340
 smell please and let's leave this 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.020
 delicious atole 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.570
 be done during the course of 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.950
 program since I'm seeing that already 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:37.280
 the cache dissolved 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:40.430
 it's time to add the starch 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.230
 and thicken over medium heat 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.060
 during our program 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:49.000
 I have vanilla pod 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.200
 so it's a fresh vanilla pod 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.810
 it's so fresh that it could be removed 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.130
 perfectly all this perfume 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.230
 delicious that are small 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.320
 little seeds 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.320
 that perfume 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.920
 the pastry 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:09.650
 would be for example the French without 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.080
 nothing and girls who have no chocolate 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.240
 the Swiss for example we make ourselves 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.790
 dealing in scares to baking is not 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.740
 the same without two products so 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.340
 important that we made known to the 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.720
 world america especially mexico because 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.280
 there's a lawsuit for example with the 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.370
 chocolate they say no 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.870
 they found it first in South America and 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.260
 it seems that the vestiges do not seem 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.810
 oldest they have found are 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.610
 really in tabasco tabasco in the area 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.830
 of Tabasco and Chiapas, we are going to leave 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.500
 these actors who are expressing themselves 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.110
 they are going to thicken 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.490
 during the program so that at the end of 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.680
 our final presentation of the 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.210
 dishes are ready and we can
