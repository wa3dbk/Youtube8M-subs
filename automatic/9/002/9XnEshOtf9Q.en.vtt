you<00:02:27.380> really<00:02:27.470> need<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.680> take<00:02:27.890> out<00:02:28.070> of<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.280> is

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
you really need to take out of this is

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.250 
you really need to take out of this is
that<00:02:28.760> they<00:02:28.850> do<00:02:28.910> say<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.840> they<00:02:29.960> do<00:02:30.020> have

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
that they do say that they do have

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.830 
that they do say that they do have
exploits<00:02:30.680> for<00:02:30.740> iOS<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:32.060> know<00:02:32.150> they<00:02:32.420> still

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
exploits for iOS and you know they still

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.660 
exploits for iOS and you know they still
need<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.020> test<00:02:33.290> them<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:33.530> iOS<00:02:33.830> 8.3<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:34.520> we're

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
need to test them on iOS 8.3 so we're

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.420 
need to test them on iOS 8.3 so we're
not<00:02:34.820> sure<00:02:35.120> if<00:02:35.230> exploits<00:02:36.230> were<00:02:36.380> patched<00:02:36.650> in<00:02:36.860> 8.3

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
not sure if exploits were patched in 8.3

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.460 
not sure if exploits were patched in 8.3
but<00:02:37.670> there's<00:02:38.150> no<00:02:38.240> reason<00:02:38.360> for<00:02:38.630> them<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.930> be<00:02:39.140> you

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
but there's no reason for them to be you

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.800 
but there's no reason for them to be you
know<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.620> be<00:02:39.770> honest<00:02:40.040> with<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.310> because<00:02:40.810> you

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
know to be honest with you because you

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.570 
know to be honest with you because you
know<00:02:41.960> apple<00:02:42.470> doesn't<00:02:42.710> know<00:02:42.950> about<00:02:43.070> them<00:02:43.340> it's

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
know apple doesn't know about them it's

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.370 
know apple doesn't know about them it's
extremely<00:02:44.210> rare<00:02:44.540> that<00:02:44.840> they're<00:02:44.990> going<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.260> be

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
extremely rare that they're going to be

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.870 
extremely rare that they're going to be
able<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.590> patch<00:02:45.770> them<00:02:46.040> because<00:02:46.550> they<00:02:46.700> haven't

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
able to patch them because they haven't

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.270 
able to patch them because they haven't

completely redesigned music application
you<00:04:43.830> know<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.310> entire<00:04:44.700> thing<00:04:44.760> is<00:04:45.090> redesigned

you know the entire thing is redesigned

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.360 
you know the entire thing is redesigned
it<00:04:45.690> actually<00:04:45.990> looks<00:04:46.170> really<00:04:46.230> nice<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.890> the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
it actually looks really nice and the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.530 
it actually looks really nice and the
reason<00:04:47.550> I'm<00:04:47.640> mentioning<00:04:47.760> it<00:04:48.120> in<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:48.240> video

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
reason I'm mentioning it in this video

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.030 
reason I'm mentioning it in this video
is<00:04:48.780> because<00:04:48.930> some<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.770> may<00:04:49.860> be<00:04:49.890> wondering

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
is because some of you may be wondering

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.660 
is because some of you may be wondering
if<00:04:50.670> pangu<00:04:51.270> or<00:04:51.990> taiji<00:04:52.500> whoever<00:04:53.040> releases<00:04:53.580> the

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
if pangu or taiji whoever releases the

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.340 
if pangu or taiji whoever releases the
next<00:04:53.880> jailbreak<00:04:54.240> is<00:04:54.390> going<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.750> wait<00:04:55.080> until

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
next jailbreak is going to wait until

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.380 
next jailbreak is going to wait until
8.4<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.490> released<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.940> public<00:04:57.030> before

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
8.4 is released to the public before

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.330 
8.4 is released to the public before
releasing<00:04:57.900> then<00:04:58.140> jailbreak<00:04:58.380> now<00:04:59.100> we<00:04:59.160> don't

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
releasing then jailbreak now we don't

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.550 
releasing then jailbreak now we don't
know<00:04:59.580> however<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.600> would<00:05:00.660> say<00:05:00.930> it's<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.260> pretty

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
know however I would say it's a pretty

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.840 
know however I would say it's a pretty
safe<00:05:01.770> bet<00:05:01.830> that<00:05:02.070> that's<00:05:02.280> not<00:05:02.550> going<00:05:02.700> to<00:05:02.790> happen

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
safe bet that that's not going to happen

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.430 
safe bet that that's not going to happen
because<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:03.750> release<00:05:03.990> is<00:05:04.110> most<00:05:04.290> likely

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
because this release is most likely

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.590 
because this release is most likely
going<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.710> become<00:05:04.830> is<00:05:05.370> going<00:05:05.610> to<00:05:05.730> be<00:05:05.850> released

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
going to become is going to be released

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.990 
going to become is going to be released
towards<00:05:07.200> June<00:05:07.920> and<00:05:08.250> that's<00:05:08.460> obviously<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.820> long

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
towards June and that's obviously a long

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.960 
towards June and that's obviously a long
time<00:05:09.330> so<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:10.200> know<00:05:10.260> I<00:05:10.530> would<00:05:10.920> most<00:05:11.130> likely<00:05:11.310> say

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
time so you know I would most likely say

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.610 
time so you know I would most likely say
that<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.390> jailbreak<00:05:12.930> is<00:05:13.050> going<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.530> be

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
that the jailbreak is going to be

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.310 
that the jailbreak is going to be
released<00:05:13.920> on<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.190> was<00:05:14.610> 8.3<00:05:15.600> as<00:05:15.840> opposed<00:05:16.140> to<00:05:16.290> any

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
released on I was 8.3 as opposed to any

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.590 
released on I was 8.3 as opposed to any
future<00:05:16.740> version<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:18.060> it<00:05:18.210> is<00:05:18.300> true<00:05:18.570> that

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
future version and it is true that

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.170 
future version and it is true that
waiting<00:05:19.050> for<00:05:19.200> iOS<00:05:19.500> 8.4<00:05:20.190> is<00:05:20.430> you<00:05:21.060> know

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
waiting for iOS 8.4 is you know

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.870 
waiting for iOS 8.4 is you know
technically<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:21.930> smarter<00:05:22.650> route<00:05:22.860> when<00:05:23.790> it

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
technically a smarter route when it

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.730 
technically a smarter route when it
comes<00:05:24.090> to<00:05:24.270> preserving<00:05:24.540> exploits<00:05:25.410> because

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
comes to preserving exploits because

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.440 
comes to preserving exploits because
when<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.400> jailbreak<00:05:26.610> is<00:05:26.910> released<00:05:27.270> the

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
when a jailbreak is released the

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.390 
when a jailbreak is released the
exploits<00:05:28.020> that<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.260> jailbreak<00:05:28.680> uses<00:05:29.220> are

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
exploits that the jailbreak uses are

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.550 
exploits that the jailbreak uses are
also<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:30.600> know<00:05:30.720> disclosed<00:05:31.290> to<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.530> public

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
also you know disclosed to the public

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.500 
also you know disclosed to the public
you<00:05:32.070> know<00:05:32.130> released<00:05:32.640> and<00:05:32.910> therefore

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
you know released and therefore

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.180 
you know released and therefore
applicant<00:05:33.990> look<00:05:34.110> at<00:05:34.200> those<00:05:34.290> exploits<00:05:34.770> and

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
applicant look at those exploits and

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.860 
applicant look at those exploits and
then<00:05:35.370> patch<00:05:35.610> them<00:05:35.910> in<00:05:36.030> future<00:05:36.210> versions<00:05:36.540> of

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
then patch them in future versions of

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.650 
then patch them in future versions of
iOS<00:05:37.250> so<00:05:38.250> most<00:05:38.490> likely<00:05:38.580> if<00:05:39.060> this<00:05:39.330> jailbreak

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
iOS so most likely if this jailbreak

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.440 
iOS so most likely if this jailbreak
does<00:05:40.020> get<00:05:40.260> released<00:05:40.590> for<00:05:40.800> iOS<00:05:40.919> 8.3<00:05:41.610> most

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
does get released for iOS 8.3 most

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.300 
does get released for iOS 8.3 most
likely<00:05:42.750> this<00:05:42.870> jailbreak<00:05:43.169> will<00:05:43.440> be<00:05:43.530> patched<00:05:43.890> in

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
likely this jailbreak will be patched in

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.560 
likely this jailbreak will be patched in
iOS<00:05:44.900> 8.4<00:05:45.900> however<00:05:46.740> iOS<00:05:47.220> 8.4<00:05:47.730> is<00:05:47.820> just<00:05:48.060> so<00:05:48.270> far

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
iOS 8.4 however iOS 8.4 is just so far

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.420 
iOS 8.4 however iOS 8.4 is just so far
away<00:05:48.630> that<00:05:49.169> again<00:05:49.770> this<00:05:49.860> jailbreak<00:05:50.070> is<00:05:50.250> most

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
away that again this jailbreak is most

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.960 
away that again this jailbreak is most
likely<00:05:50.669> going<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.000> be<00:05:51.090> released<00:05:51.419> for<00:05:51.720> iOS<00:05:51.960> 8.3

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
likely going to be released for iOS 8.3

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.280 
likely going to be released for iOS 8.3
of<00:05:53.970> course<00:05:54.270> when<00:05:54.360> this<00:05:54.450> jailbreak<00:05:54.810> does<00:05:55.080> come

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
of course when this jailbreak does come

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.020 
of course when this jailbreak does come
