00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
water each time and it can take up to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
adds a big difference in the feel and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.850 
adds a big difference in the feel and
the<00:01:24.060> taste<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.600> rice<00:01:24.780> at<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> end<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.680> once

you get that cooked and you get the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.720 
you get that cooked and you get the

and how much salt you're putting in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.550 
and how much salt you're putting in
there<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:50.580> your<00:01:50.729> own<00:01:50.909> personal<00:01:51.360> tastes<00:01:51.840> so

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
there for your own personal tastes so

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.140 
there for your own personal tastes so
you<00:01:52.620> put<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> little<00:01:53.460> small<00:01:53.850> saucepan

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
you put this in a little small saucepan

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.480 
you put this in a little small saucepan
and<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.900> goal<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.320> get<00:01:55.620> it<00:01:55.770> heated<00:01:55.979> up<00:01:56.220> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
and the goal is to get it heated up and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.940 
and the goal is to get it heated up and
have<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.240> melt<00:01:57.510> into<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> actual<00:01:58.470> rice<00:01:58.710> wine

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
have it melt into the actual rice wine

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.130 
have it melt into the actual rice wine
vinegar<00:01:59.000> so<00:02:00.000> it'll<00:02:00.330> spread<00:02:00.630> over<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:00.990> rice

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
vinegar so it'll spread over the rice

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.580 
vinegar so it'll spread over the rice
evenly<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:02.090> now<00:02:03.090> our<00:02:03.270> rice<00:02:03.510> is<00:02:03.540> completed<00:02:04.320> it

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590

in<00:02:23.359> two<00:02:23.569> stages<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.859> you<00:02:24.889> can<00:02:25.010> taste<00:02:25.340> tests<00:02:25.639> in

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
in two stages so you can taste tests in

only can you not make sushi with hot
rice<00:02:44.329> I<00:02:44.659> tried<00:02:45.109> it<00:02:45.319> it's<00:02:45.530> not<00:02:45.829> fun<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.599> you

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
rice I tried it it's not fun it you

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.179 
rice I tried it it's not fun it you
really<00:02:47.930> wanted<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.439> have<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.739> stopped<00:02:48.950> cooking

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:49.189 
really wanted to have it stopped cooking

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.819 
really wanted to have it stopped cooking
so<00:02:49.609> it<00:02:49.730> holds<00:02:49.969> that<00:02:50.269> texture<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.959> don't<00:02:51.650> add<00:02:51.799> a

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
so it holds that texture I don't add a

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.800 
so it holds that texture I don't add a
little<00:02:52.099> bit<00:02:52.250> more<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:52.790> rice<00:02:53.480> wine<00:02:53.780> and

sugar in the salt mixture continue to

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.349
