all right we're going to talk a little
bit<00:00:03.120> about<00:00:03.470> developing<00:00:04.470> power<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.549> speed

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
bit about developing power and speed

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.100 
bit about developing power and speed
which<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:08.030> through<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> technique<00:00:09.690> called<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
which is through a technique called the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.530 
which is through a technique called the
swivel<00:00:10.650> technique<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.759> basically<00:00:12.240> what

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
swivel technique and basically what

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.230 
swivel technique and basically what
you're<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.990> do<00:00:16.820> is<00:00:17.820> you're<00:00:18.029> placing

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
you're going to do is you're placing

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.779 
you're going to do is you're placing
your<00:00:18.420> foot<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.930> pedal<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.859> you're

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
your foot on the pedal and you're

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.769 
your foot on the pedal and you're
swiveling<00:00:22.100> side-to-side<00:00:23.630> and<00:00:24.630> you're

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
swiveling side-to-side and you're

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.450 
swiveling side-to-side and you're
basically<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.619> drop<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
basically it's like you drop the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.779 
basically it's like you drop the
cigarette<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> ground<00:00:27.410> step<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.859> and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
cigarette on the ground step on it and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.299 
cigarette on the ground step on it and
you're<00:00:29.910> pushing<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.300> back<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.660> forth<00:00:30.900> okay<00:00:31.380> so

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you're pushing it back and forth okay so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.760 
you're pushing it back and forth okay so
what<00:00:32.489> we're<00:00:32.640> doing<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:33.000> we're<00:00:33.649> swiveling<00:00:34.649> our

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
what we're doing is we're swiveling our

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.340 
what we're doing is we're swiveling our
feet<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:36.390> right<00:00:36.630> foot<00:00:36.899> goes<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> left<00:00:39.350> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
feet the right foot goes to the left the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.100 
feet the right foot goes to the left the
left<00:00:40.379> foot<00:00:40.800> goes<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> left<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.930> right

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
left foot goes to the left the right

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.650 
left foot goes to the left the right
foot<00:00:43.379> goes<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> right<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.420> swivel

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
foot goes to the right and you swivel

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.740 
foot goes to the right and you swivel
your<00:00:45.870> ankle<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.469> left<00:00:47.370> foot<00:00:47.550> comes<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.539> again

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
your ankle the left foot comes in again

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.799 
your ankle the left foot comes in again
and<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.350> start<00:00:49.680> slowly<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:51.300> you're<00:00:51.420> basically

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and you start slowly so you're basically

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.270 
and you start slowly so you're basically
doing<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.230> yes<00:00:52.379> we're<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> cut<00:00:52.980> down<00:00:53.129> on

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
doing it yes we're going to cut down on

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.560 
doing it yes we're going to cut down on
the<00:00:53.340> feet<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> second<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.120> you're<00:00:54.210> basically

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the feet in a second so you're basically

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.590 
the feet in a second so you're basically
going

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.789 

okay<00:01:04.869> introducing<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:05.990> swivel<00:01:06.380> technique

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
okay introducing the swivel technique

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.550 
okay introducing the swivel technique
now<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.130> has<00:01:07.390> been<00:01:08.390> made<00:01:08.630> popular<00:01:08.930> by<00:01:09.200> guys

further than anybody has ever gone
speech<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.890> power<00:01:22.250> was<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:23.420> believe<00:01:23.930> this

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
speech and power was so I believe this

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.380 
speech and power was so I believe this
is<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.130> technique<00:01:25.670> that's<00:01:25.729> going<00:01:25.909> to<00:01:26.060> help<00:01:26.210> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
is a technique that's going to help the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.420 
is a technique that's going to help the
drummers<00:01:26.750> achieve<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.770> speed<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:28.250> they're

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
drummers achieve the speed that they're

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.160 
drummers achieve the speed that they're
going<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.640> want<00:01:29.149> to<00:01:29.240> get<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.690> but<00:01:29.930> with<00:01:30.140> the

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
going to want to get to but with the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.310 
going to want to get to but with the
power<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:31.360> starting<00:01:32.360> slowly<00:01:32.600> like<00:01:32.990> when<00:01:33.200> we

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
power so starting slowly like when we

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.440 
power so starting slowly like when we
learn<00:01:33.500> playing<00:01:34.190> bass<00:01:34.700> drums<00:01:35.030> with<00:01:35.300> their

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
learn playing bass drums with their

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:50.590 
learn playing bass drums with their
hands<00:01:36.520> take<00:01:37.520> quarter<00:01:37.940> notes<00:01:38.119> one<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:50.420> learn

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
hands take quarter notes one you learn

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.460 
hands take quarter notes one you learn
to<00:01:50.780> play<00:01:50.960> all<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.259> same<00:01:51.470> pattern<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.600> slowly

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:05.169 

quarter<00:01:57.470> note<00:02:01.509> you<00:02:02.509> can<00:02:02.659> go<00:02:03.880> with<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:04.970> left

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
quarter note you can go with the left

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.060 
quarter note you can go with the left
foot<00:02:05.469> in<00:02:06.469> with<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.430> right<00:02:07.610> foot<00:02:07.850> in<00:02:08.979> put<00:02:09.979> the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
foot in with the right foot in put the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.979 
foot in with the right foot in put the
left<00:02:10.280> foot<00:02:10.549> how<00:02:11.209> are<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.480> right<00:02:11.660> foot<00:02:11.870> so

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
left foot how are the right foot so

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.900 
left foot how are the right foot so
you're<00:02:12.110> basically<00:02:12.410> chasing<00:02:13.220> each<00:02:13.489> other<00:02:13.730> this

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
you're basically chasing each other this

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.090 
you're basically chasing each other this
one<00:02:14.120> goes

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
one goes

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:26.360 
one goes
