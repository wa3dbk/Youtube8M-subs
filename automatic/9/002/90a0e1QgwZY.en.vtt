 Database the internal both the internal to the external 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.000
 around 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.079
 but you also think 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.820
 the external means so the memory cards that occur here Secret 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:28.970

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.050
 You can see that here somewhere fruit is at work on 8 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.320
 and on the memory card and again 8 million more 16 won 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.670
 a total of 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.430
