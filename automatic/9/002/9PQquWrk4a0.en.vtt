00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.200 
it to the bit to the center or I guess
that<00:02:01.170> would<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:02.060> case<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.360> use<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:04.040> or<00:02:05.090> if<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
that would be a case to use it or if you

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.700 
that would be a case to use it or if you
want<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.360> move<00:02:06.479> move<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.079> couple<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.469> innings

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
want to move move to couple of innings

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.880 
want to move move to couple of innings
at<00:02:08.039> once<00:02:08.569> so<00:02:09.569> that's<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.869> good<00:02:09.899> feature<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.649> think

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
at once so that's a good feature I think

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.059 
at once so that's a good feature I think
so<00:02:12.890> we'll<00:02:13.069> got<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.430> as<00:02:13.580> well<00:02:13.930> or<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.890> can

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
so we'll got that as well or you can

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.149 
so we'll got that as well or you can
just<00:02:16.299> clear<00:02:17.299> the<00:02:17.420> whole<00:02:17.569> village<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.159> start

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
just clear the whole village and start

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.449 
just clear the whole village and start
from<00:02:19.340> scratch<00:02:19.400> we're<00:02:20.090> going<00:02:20.269> for<00:02:20.510> scratch<00:02:21.459> so

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
from scratch we're going for scratch so

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.559 
from scratch we're going for scratch so
that's<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.420> very<00:02:23.750> useful<00:02:23.930> future<00:02:24.709> if<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:26.239> want

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
that's a very useful future if you want

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.449 
that's a very useful future if you want
to<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:28.000> start<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.269> base<00:02:29.840> design<00:02:30.319> which<00:02:31.190> is

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
to just start a base design which is

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.880 
to just start a base design which is
very<00:02:31.819> very<00:02:32.180> different<00:02:32.840> from<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.500> one<00:02:33.650> you

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
very very different from the one you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.330 
very very different from the one you
have<00:02:34.220> at<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:35.000> moment<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:36.190> sometimes<00:02:37.190> people

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
have at the moment so sometimes people

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.280 
have at the moment so sometimes people
just<00:02:37.579> want<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:38.060> rearrange<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.690> few<00:02:38.900> buildings

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
just want to rearrange a few buildings

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.729 
just want to rearrange a few buildings
in<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.650> base<00:02:39.799> were<00:02:40.220> just<00:02:40.519> some<00:02:41.299> walls<00:02:41.739> which

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
in the base were just some walls which

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.259 
in the base were just some walls which
is<00:02:42.890> fine<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.489> don't<00:02:43.610> have<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.940> search<00:02:44.120> from

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
is fine you don't have to search from

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.599 
is fine you don't have to search from
scratch<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:45.260> can<00:02:45.440> just<00:02:45.680> remove<00:02:46.310> all<00:02:46.519> the

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
scratch you can just remove all the

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.309 
scratch you can just remove all the
walls<00:02:46.760> rearrange<00:02:47.299> your<00:02:47.420> buildings<00:02:47.810> put<00:02:48.200> them

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
walls rearrange your buildings put them

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.960 
walls rearrange your buildings put them
back<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.829> it's<00:02:49.190> all<00:02:49.370> good<00:02:49.489> it's<00:02:49.700> going<00:02:49.879> to

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
back and it's all good it's going to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.500 
back and it's all good it's going to
take<00:02:50.090> just<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.079> few<00:02:51.109> minutes<00:02:51.579> but<00:02:52.579> other<00:02:53.030> people

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
take just a few minutes but other people

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.949 
take just a few minutes but other people
I<00:02:53.709> like<00:02:54.709> just<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.340> try<00:02:55.640> very<00:02:55.970> different<00:02:56.750> base

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
I like just to try very different base

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.160 
I like just to try very different base
page<00:02:57.409> layouts<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.120> guess<00:02:59.329> the<00:02:59.659> best<00:02:59.840> option

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
page layouts so I guess the best option

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.750 
page layouts so I guess the best option
would<00:03:00.319> be<00:03:00.379> to<00:03:00.560> clear<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.220> whole<00:03:01.400> old

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
would be to clear the whole old

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.690 
would be to clear the whole old
buildings<00:03:02.299> I<00:03:02.739> just<00:03:03.739> start<00:03:04.129> start<00:03:04.549> from

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
buildings I just start start from

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.410 
buildings I just start start from
scratch<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.920> for<00:03:06.920> me<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.040> think<00:03:07.250> that's<00:03:07.519> that's

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
scratch so for me I think that's that's

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.330 
scratch so for me I think that's that's
what<00:03:08.750> one<00:03:09.079> good<00:03:09.230> reason<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.799> use<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.099> option

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
what one good reason to use this option

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.050 
what one good reason to use this option
but<00:03:11.090> again<00:03:11.659> very<00:03:12.200> useful<00:03:12.560> future<00:03:12.920> I'm<00:03:13.790> very

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
but again very useful future I'm very

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.530 
but again very useful future I'm very
happy<00:03:14.329> with<00:03:14.359> that<00:03:14.569> this<00:03:15.440> would<00:03:15.650> allow<00:03:16.040> me<00:03:16.099> to

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
happy with that this would allow me to

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.780 
happy with that this would allow me to
test<00:03:17.540> different<00:03:17.720> base<00:03:18.200> layout<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:19.310> it's

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
test different base layout and it's

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.339 
test different base layout and it's
going<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:19.970> save<00:03:20.150> me<00:03:20.269> a<00:03:20.299> lot<00:03:20.359> of<00:03:20.480> time<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.959> just

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
going to save me a lot of time of just

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.069 
going to save me a lot of time of just
moving<00:03:21.620> buildings<00:03:22.160> around<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.790> can<00:03:23.060> just<00:03:23.209> get

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
moving buildings around I can just get

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.349 
moving buildings around I can just get
rid<00:03:24.349> of<00:03:24.380> them<00:03:24.530> all<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:24.950> then<00:03:25.519> you<00:03:26.030> can<00:03:26.209> see

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
rid of them all and then you can see

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.199 
rid of them all and then you can see
they're<00:03:26.540> all<00:03:26.750> at<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.440> bottom<00:03:28.060> available<00:03:29.060> and

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
they're all at the bottom available and

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.409 
they're all at the bottom available and
then<00:03:29.359> you<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.629> just<00:03:29.780> drag<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.650> drop<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.419> yeah

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
then you can just drag and drop and yeah

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.490 
then you can just drag and drop and yeah
that's<00:03:33.260> basically<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:35.019> at<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.200> end<00:03:36.230> if

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
that's basically it and at the end if

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.740 
that's basically it and at the end if
you're<00:03:36.650> not<00:03:36.799> happy<00:03:37.069> with<00:03:37.419> what<00:03:38.419> you've<00:03:38.569> done

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
you're not happy with what you've done

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.349 
you're not happy with what you've done
so<00:03:38.810> far<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.349> can<00:03:39.500> always<00:03:39.739> get<00:03:39.950> back<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.359> the

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
so far you can always get back to the

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.659 
so far you can always get back to the
previous<00:03:41.629> layout<00:03:42.109> by<00:03:42.680> restoring<00:03:43.430> your

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
previous layout by restoring your

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.240 
previous layout by restoring your
village<00:03:44.410> so<00:03:45.410> that's<00:03:45.739> going<00:03:45.859> to<00:03:45.919> it<00:03:46.010> for<00:03:46.160> this

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
village so that's going to it for this

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.490 
village so that's going to it for this
