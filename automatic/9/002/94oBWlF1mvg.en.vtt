00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.240 
and this is a little bit you can smell
as<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.910> like<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:08.880> know<00:02:09.880> for<00:02:10.119> some<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:11.800> me<00:02:11.980> hair

as you like I know for some for me hair
textures<00:02:13.080> frizz<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.110> just<00:02:14.650> part<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.750> its<00:02:16.750> part

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
textures frizz is just part of its part

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.880 
textures frizz is just part of its part
of<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:18.090> I'm<00:02:19.090> not<00:02:19.150> going<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.720> be<00:02:19.900> too<00:02:20.290> precise

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
of it so I'm not going to be too precise

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.750 
of it so I'm not going to be too precise
I<00:02:21.340> don't<00:02:21.760> need<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.120> separate<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.660> whole<00:02:22.930> bunch

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
I don't need to separate a whole bunch

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.910 
I don't need to separate a whole bunch
I'm<00:02:24.760> going<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.090> start<00:02:25.360> off<00:02:25.510> by<00:02:25.840> separating<00:02:26.500> it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
I'm going to start off by separating it

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.630 
I'm going to start off by separating it
in<00:02:27.160> in<00:02:27.940> half<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:31.420> would<00:02:31.930> say<00:02:32.200> my<00:02:32.890> separating

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
in in half and I would say my separating

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.390 
in in half and I would say my separating
technique<00:02:34.120> is<00:02:34.329> not<00:02:34.630> quite<00:02:34.900> perfected<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.829> know

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
technique is not quite perfected I know

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.250 
technique is not quite perfected I know
a<00:02:36.430> lot<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.700> people<00:02:38.130> separate<00:02:39.130> from<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.579> root

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
a lot of people separate from the root

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.900 
a lot of people separate from the root
sometimes<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.410> get<00:02:41.590> tangles<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.549> makes<00:02:42.790> it

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
sometimes I get tangles so that makes it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.960 
sometimes I get tangles so that makes it
difficult<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:44.350> if<00:02:44.650> anybody<00:02:45.070> has<00:02:45.310> any<00:02:45.340> tips<00:02:45.850> for

lose the definition I'm going to try to
pick<00:03:44.200> from<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.740> roots<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.130> try<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.459> give<00:03:45.700> it

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
pick from the roots to try to give it

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.100 
pick from the roots to try to give it
some<00:03:46.030> lift<00:03:46.270> because<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.410> is<00:03:47.709> just<00:03:48.480> too<00:03:49.480> flat

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
some lift because this is just too flat

00:03:50.110 --> 00:04:03.569 
some lift because this is just too flat
for<00:03:50.530> me

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.629 

just<00:04:04.579> pulling<00:04:04.969> from<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.359> roots<00:04:05.629> out<00:04:06.370> not<00:04:07.370> all

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
just pulling from the roots out not all

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:14.920 
just pulling from the roots out not all
the<00:04:07.670> way<00:04:07.939> out<00:04:07.969> just<00:04:09.249> from<00:04:10.249> the<00:04:10.459> roots<00:04:13.719> which<00:04:14.719> I

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
the way out just from the roots which I

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.430 
the way out just from the roots which I
obviously<00:04:15.290> got<00:04:15.920> some<00:04:16.850> rook<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:18.049> know<00:04:18.199> that's

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
obviously got some rook you know that's

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.490 
obviously got some rook you know that's
where<00:04:18.650> is<00:04:18.880> in<00:04:19.880> this<00:04:20.630> true<00:04:20.959> is<00:04:21.139> staying<00:04:21.639> state

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
where is in this true is staying state

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.740 
where is in this true is staying state
they're<00:04:24.500> in<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.800> twist<00:04:25.639> out<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:25.970> can<00:04:26.389> do<00:04:26.570> to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
they're in a twist out I can do to

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.510 
they're in a twist out I can do to
change<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.789> afro<00:04:29.979> texture<00:04:30.979> at<00:04:31.099> the<00:04:31.310> roof

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
change that afro texture at the roof

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.560 
change that afro texture at the roof
anyway<00:04:32.000> I'm<00:04:32.539> trying<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.259> get<00:04:33.440> some<00:04:33.500> lift<00:04:34.009> and

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.110 

we'll<00:04:38.570> see<00:04:38.750> how<00:04:38.900> it<00:04:38.930> is<00:04:39.199> I<00:04:39.440> think<00:04:40.099> that<00:04:40.400> because

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
we'll see how it is I think that because

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.850 
we'll see how it is I think that because
my<00:04:41.330> hair<00:04:41.539> is<00:04:41.570> getting<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:42.020> little<00:04:42.229> bit<00:04:42.500> longer

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
my hair is getting a little bit longer

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.770 
my hair is getting a little bit longer
and<00:04:43.699> not<00:04:44.300> even<00:04:44.570> with<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.930> lymph<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:46.370> was<00:04:47.360> doing

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
and not even with the lymph I was doing

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.249 
and not even with the lymph I was doing
a<00:04:47.930> lot<00:04:48.139> of<00:04:50.199> using<00:04:51.199> perm<00:04:51.470> rods<00:04:51.770> on<00:04:52.009> the<00:04:52.190> end<00:04:52.490> and

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
a lot of using perm rods on the end and

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.939 
a lot of using perm rods on the end and
using<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:54.349> palm<00:04:54.620> rods<00:04:54.860> on<00:04:55.099> the<00:04:55.190> end<00:04:56.590> made<00:04:57.590> sure

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
using the palm rods on the end made sure

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.890 
using the palm rods on the end made sure
that<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.280> had<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.870> know<00:05:00.020> a<00:05:00.050> nice<00:05:00.289> cute<00:05:00.710> little

if<00:06:08.980> i<00:06:09.730> wanted<00:06:10.180> to<00:06:10.240> i<00:06:11.670> probably<00:06:12.670> could<00:06:13.150> take<00:06:13.330> a

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
if i wanted to i probably could take a

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.450 
if i wanted to i probably could take a
little<00:06:13.600> bit<00:06:13.810> of<00:06:13.870> heat<00:06:14.170> and<00:06:14.350> blast<00:06:14.620> my<00:06:15.160> roots

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
little bit of heat and blast my roots

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.280 
little bit of heat and blast my roots
just<00:06:15.820> to<00:06:15.970> stretch<00:06:16.210> it<00:06:16.390> out<00:06:16.510> a<00:06:16.570> little<00:06:16.840> bit<00:06:17.050> i

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
just to stretch it out a little bit i

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.440 
just to stretch it out a little bit i
think<00:06:17.860> part<00:06:18.190> of<00:06:18.280> it<00:06:18.430> is<00:06:18.490> you<00:06:18.970> guys<00:06:19.150> saw<00:06:19.390> the

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
think part of it is you guys saw the

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.540 
think part of it is you guys saw the
video<00:06:19.840> when<00:06:20.110> i<00:06:20.140> just<00:06:20.440> took<00:06:20.590> my<00:06:20.800> crochet<00:06:21.190> braids

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
video when i just took my crochet braids

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.790 
video when i just took my crochet braids
out<00:06:21.730> and<00:06:22.410> it<00:06:23.410> was<00:06:23.680> emails<00:06:24.669> big<00:06:25.330> and<00:06:26.140> fluffy<00:06:26.500> and

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
out and it was emails big and fluffy and

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.659 
out and it was emails big and fluffy and
had<00:06:27.130> movement<00:06:27.430> that<00:06:28.180> was<00:06:28.419> about<00:06:28.630> a<00:06:28.690> stretched

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
had movement that was about a stretched

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.340 
had movement that was about a stretched
you<00:06:30.669> know<00:06:30.850> as<00:06:31.210> my<00:06:31.419> hair<00:06:31.690> could<00:06:31.900> be<00:06:32.110> without

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
you know as my hair could be without

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
you know as my hair could be without
adding<00:06:32.950> any<00:06:33.190> heat<00:06:33.220> to<00:06:33.640> it<00:06:33.820> so<00:06:34.090> i<00:06:34.360> think<00:06:35.160> it<00:06:36.160> got

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
adding any heat to it so i think it got

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.040 
adding any heat to it so i think it got
me<00:06:36.550> a<00:06:36.580> little<00:06:36.790> bit<00:06:36.970> excited<00:06:37.600> and<00:06:37.750> thinking<00:06:37.990> I

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
me a little bit excited and thinking I

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.200 
me a little bit excited and thinking I
was<00:06:38.169> going<00:06:38.320> to<00:06:38.410> get<00:06:38.560> it<00:06:39.550> something<00:06:39.880> similar

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
was going to get it something similar

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.740 
was going to get it something similar
but<00:06:40.570> i<00:06:40.630> think<00:06:40.870> i'm<00:06:40.930> going<00:06:41.050> to<00:06:41.140> try<00:06:41.290> a<00:06:41.350> new

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
but i think i'm going to try a new

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.810 
but i think i'm going to try a new
setting<00:06:43.750> method<00:06:44.200> using<00:06:44.770> flat<00:06:45.250> twist<00:06:45.610> which

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
setting method using flat twist which

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.640
