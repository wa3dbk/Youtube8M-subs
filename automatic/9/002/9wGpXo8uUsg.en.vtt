sometimes<00:01:08.800> just<00:01:09.340> disturb<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.970> dust<00:01:10.240> rather

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
sometimes just disturb the dust rather

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.840 
sometimes just disturb the dust rather
than<00:01:11.110> actually<00:01:11.440> sucking<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.890> up<00:01:12.040> they<00:01:12.580> can

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
than actually sucking it up they can

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.400 
than actually sucking it up they can
flick<00:01:13.150> dust<00:01:13.420> up<00:01:13.600> into<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.900> air<00:01:14.050> which<00:01:14.290> is

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
flick dust up into the air which is

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.700 
flick dust up into the air which is
really<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.770> last<00:01:14.920> place<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.460> want<00:01:15.670> it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
really the last place that you want it

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.020 
really the last place that you want it
having<00:01:17.710> sucked<00:01:17.950> up<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.190> dust<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.670> dirt<00:01:18.790> from

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
having sucked up the dust and dirt from

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.340 
having sucked up the dust and dirt from
the<00:01:19.120> floor<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.540> next<00:01:19.660> thing<00:01:19.900> we<00:01:19.990> have<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.260> do

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
the floor the next thing we have to do

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.990 
the floor the next thing we have to do
is<00:01:20.470> separate<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.010> dust<00:01:21.310> from<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.610> airflow

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
is separate the dust from the airflow

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.640 
is separate the dust from the airflow
and<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.270> way<00:01:22.690> we<00:01:22.810> achieve<00:01:23.110> this<00:01:23.290> is<00:01:23.500> by<00:01:23.530> using

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
and the way we achieve this is by using

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.670 
and the way we achieve this is by using
cyclonic<00:01:24.400> technology<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.810> we<00:01:25.960> have<00:01:26.110> one<00:01:26.350> large

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
cyclonic technology so we have one large

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.890 
cyclonic technology so we have one large
outer<00:01:27.100> cyclone<00:01:27.730> and<00:01:27.970> we<00:01:28.120> have<00:01:28.270> eight<00:01:28.480> inner

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
outer cyclone and we have eight inner

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.900 
outer cyclone and we have eight inner
cyclones<00:01:29.410> that<00:01:29.710> remove<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.070> finer<00:01:30.340> dust<00:01:30.670> and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
cyclones that remove the finer dust and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.910 
cyclones that remove the finer dust and
because<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.720> extremely<00:01:32.140> high<00:01:32.380> velocity

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
because of the extremely high velocity

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.620 
because of the extremely high velocity
of<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.100> airflow<00:01:33.520> we're<00:01:33.790> even<00:01:34.060> able<00:01:34.300> to<00:01:34.390> remove

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
of the airflow we're even able to remove

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.310 
of the airflow we're even able to remove
microscopic<00:01:35.410> particles<00:01:35.860> from<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.130> air

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
microscopic particles from the air

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.810 
microscopic particles from the air
