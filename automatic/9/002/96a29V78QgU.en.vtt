open in case that you find any more who
I<00:03:04.060> probably<00:03:04.359> will<00:03:04.569> but<00:03:05.430> takes<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.519> while<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.819> get

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
I probably will but takes a while to get

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.000 
I probably will but takes a while to get
it<00:03:07.079> unnecessary<00:03:08.310> I'll<00:03:09.310> see<00:03:09.459> what<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.670> is<00:03:09.760> uh<00:03:10.060> I

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
it unnecessary I'll see what it is uh I

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.199 
it unnecessary I'll see what it is uh I
let's<00:03:12.010> tack<00:03:12.310> his<00:03:12.489> raising<00:03:12.849> his<00:03:12.940> speed<00:03:13.180> is

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
let's tack his raising his speed is

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.190 
let's tack his raising his speed is
lowered<00:03:14.010> not<00:03:15.010> preferred<00:03:15.690> but<00:03:16.690> his<00:03:16.810> actual

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
lowered not preferred but his actual

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.099 
lowered not preferred but his actual
nature<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.769> brave<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:19.329> I'll<00:03:19.569> know<00:03:19.810> too<00:03:19.870> much

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
nature is brave so I'll know too much

nature is brave so I'll know too much
about<00:03:20.290> Noctowl<00:03:21.159> or<00:03:21.340> anything<00:03:21.700> but<00:03:22.200> don't

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
about Noctowl or anything but don't

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.940 
about Noctowl or anything but don't
think<00:03:23.319> that's<00:03:23.440> too<00:03:23.620> good<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.829> an<00:03:23.889> HR<00:03:24.220> for<00:03:24.430> them

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950
