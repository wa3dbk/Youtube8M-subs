the paperclip I'm gonna bet you a drink

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.649 
the paperclip I'm gonna bet you a drink
of<00:01:16.470> course<00:01:17.270> that<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.570> make<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.049> paperclip

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
of course that I can make a paperclip

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.830 
of course that I can make a paperclip
float<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> surface<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.710> water<00:01:23.840> do

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
float on the surface of that water do

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.170 
float on the surface of that water do
you<00:01:24.930> want<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> try<00:01:25.350> them<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.560> yourself<00:01:26.030> cuz<00:01:27.030> if

you want to try them on yourself cuz if
that<00:01:27.390> floats<00:01:27.920> I'll<00:01:28.920> buy<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.520> drink<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:31.759> don't

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
that floats I'll buy you a drink I don't

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.050 
that floats I'll buy you a drink I don't
know<00:01:33.060> maybe<00:01:33.270> hey<00:01:33.509> no<00:01:33.689> no<00:01:34.350> no<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.650> has<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.799> be

yeah I gotta be something I mean it's

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.780 
yeah I gotta be something I mean it's
kind<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.780> floating<00:01:43.110> right<00:01:43.229> now<00:01:43.549> yeah<00:01:44.549> but

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
kind of floating right now yeah but

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.440 
kind of floating right now yeah but
you're<00:01:44.880> still<00:01:45.060> holding<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.630> oh<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.500> was<00:01:46.740> so

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
you're still holding on oh it was so

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.780 
you're still holding on oh it was so
floating<00:01:48.450> over<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.960> second<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:49.979> right

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
floating over one second so that's right

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.710 
floating over one second so that's right
doesn't<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.210> make<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.140> paper<00:01:52.439> cup<00:01:52.680> float<00:01:53.720> she's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
doesn't it make a paper cup float she's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.620 
doesn't it make a paper cup float she's
very<00:01:54.990> demanding<00:01:55.290> attention<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:57.450> business

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
very demanding attention to business

this on all of your friends to mine you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.059 
this on all of your friends to mine you
take<00:02:05.820> two<00:02:06.360> paper<00:02:06.570> clips<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.290> make<00:02:07.439> one<00:02:07.680> float

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
take two paper clips to make one float

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.309 
take two paper clips to make one float
see<00:02:08.970> where<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.209> do<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.509> take<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:09.750> paper

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
see where you do is you take one paper

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.890 
see where you do is you take one paper
clip<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
clip and you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.369 
clip and you
bend<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.549> into<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.579> little<00:02:14.760> shape<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.329> that

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
bend it into a little shape like that

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.020 
bend it into a little shape like that
okay<00:02:16.379> but<00:02:16.590> remember<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:17.069> said<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.489> paperclip

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
okay but remember I said the paperclip

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.170 
okay but remember I said the paperclip
had<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.389> be<00:02:18.480> intact<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.349> floats<00:02:19.709> this<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.909> all

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
had to be intact that floats this is all

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.250 
had to be intact that floats this is all
about<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.629> surface<00:02:21.870> tension<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.620> water

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
about the surface tension of the water

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.110 
about the surface tension of the water
then<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.290> take<00:02:25.590> another<00:02:25.760> paperclip<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.999> is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
then you take another paperclip this is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.240 
then you take another paperclip this is
like<00:02:27.329> a<00:02:27.359> little<00:02:27.689> Bill<00:02:28.290> Nye<00:02:28.650> science

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
like a little Bill Nye science

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.369 
like a little Bill Nye science
experiment<00:02:30.239> guy<00:02:30.450> thing<00:02:30.780> huh

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
experiment guy thing huh

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.220 
experiment guy thing huh
you<00:02:31.590> balance<00:02:32.189> it<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.639> the<00:02:33.150> little<00:02:33.420> T<00:02:33.870> shape

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
you balance it on the little T shape

paperclip floats you see because the
little<00:02:47.700> bit<00:02:47.849> of<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.120> paperclip<00:02:48.689> won't<00:02:49.109> break

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
little bit of the paperclip won't break

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.059 
little bit of the paperclip won't break
the<00:02:49.560> surface<00:02:49.799> tension<00:02:50.060> your<00:02:51.060> fingertips<00:02:51.719> will

the surface tension your fingertips will

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.459 
the surface tension your fingertips will
every<00:02:53.069> time<00:02:53.099> now<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.969> that<00:02:54.540> my<00:02:54.780> friends<00:02:55.290> is
