pulling<00:02:23.260> out<00:02:23.350> bad<00:02:23.620> light<00:02:24.840> then<00:02:25.840> there's<00:02:26.110> a

small clip that holds the wiring harness

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.050 
small clip that holds the wiring harness
to<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.140> headlight<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:30.400> takes<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.730> little<00:02:30.880> bit

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
to the headlight this takes a little bit

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.320 
to the headlight this takes a little bit
of<00:02:31.210> finagling<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:32.050> guess<00:02:32.850> kind<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:33.910> use<00:02:34.090> the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
of finagling I guess kind of use the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.170 
of finagling I guess kind of use the
screwdriver<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.620> press<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> teeth<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:37.120> the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
screwdriver to press on the teeth of the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.740 
screwdriver to press on the teeth of the
clip<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:39.100> can<00:02:39.280> work<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.670> out<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.600> hole

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
clip and you can work it out of the hole

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:51.320 
clip and you can work it out of the hole
in<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.020> headlight
