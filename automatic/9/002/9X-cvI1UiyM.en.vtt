00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.930
 Peter after that yesterday beer today 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.700
 only he is everyone 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.700
 come out of the fight intact 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.719
 yes as far as we can judge 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.519
 very good starting position one two 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.220
 won in zwolle but such a west can 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.080
 nature still in all directions but we 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.220
 are better needed than for the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.840
 contest 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.130
 so winning out at zwolle makes them great 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.660
 have scored result there is also 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.980
 always important in one in one 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.570
 away game 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.380
 but the fight if not fought so it 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.330
 will a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.859
 another hot match will be Sunday the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.260
 match well turned into one 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.090
 victory and yes I am too 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.790
 important because you need a two 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.520
 contest or who decided the contest 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.350
 so I had made good progress there 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.850
 went down the next one after those two one 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.500
 I no, yes 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.180
 great rescue of yours or a shot 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.309
 from a distance 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.590
 yes yes no was a good shot and I sat 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.730
 also good with it so that is nice as 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.190
 keeper if you are more important for that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.260
 for the team , marga type is 20 meters 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.210
 what a great shot in the beautiful work 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.859
 what we swollen yesterday was we 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.640
 wait and waited for citizens errors 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.780
 who makes vitesse 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.720
 think they should go differently now 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.220
 because they now have to come to 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.979
 nevertheless I expect them to be the same again 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.420
 way will play against us going 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.009
 away the match if it stays the same 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.990
 or if we might avoid them what 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.430
 have to change but we are going to change them 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.600
 also give away more space 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.880
 are you going to think about another 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.500
 tactics because you don't have to do it yourself 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.000
 because if you keep the zero it is 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.049
 enough or you may want to go fast 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.070
 scores that is actually right about it 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.090
 Vitesse's trainer are also have one 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.679
 advantage that we have a whole 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.929
 recognizable way of playing and that goes 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.490
 we do not change that we do and off 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.229
 the same at home we are successful with it 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.679
 so I see no reason for that 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.789
 to change 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.560
 playing soccer at home is something 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.800
 I had to wait yesterday but I think 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.390
 nevertheless she now 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.480
 but something must be because I mean 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.130
 we must now look for the attack so we 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.420
 so far it's going to do it 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.550
 call or our own game 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.590
 and as well as our strength I think 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.970
 then vini vici and bulbs come as 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.050
 a substitute in the field was also a lot yesterday 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.790
 said about it 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.500
 4 bike cord wallace gives a narcissist 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.750
 are you going to think about them in the boss 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.730
 or or b the federall out or you with 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.020
 the same eleven starts 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.310
 no we are out of it but that is 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.520
 matters that always come first with the players 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.870
 and it's just good that we 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.710
 also have a strong bank and it turned out 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.710
 last night's thunder
