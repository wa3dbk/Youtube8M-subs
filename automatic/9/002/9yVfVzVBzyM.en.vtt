00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:02.139 
one of the wonderful things about this

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:04.679 
one of the wonderful things about this
show<00:00:02.409> is<00:00:02.679> we're<00:00:02.860> really<00:00:03.070> trying<00:00:03.340> to<00:00:03.610> trying<00:00:04.600> to

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:04.689 
show is we're really trying to trying to

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.800 
show is we're really trying to trying to
include<00:00:04.899> a<00:00:05.259> wide<00:00:05.649> variety<00:00:05.970> from<00:00:06.970> dance<00:00:07.390> to

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:07.810 
include a wide variety from dance to

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.930 
include a wide variety from dance to
drama<00:00:09.420> music<00:00:10.420> singing<00:00:10.839> and<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:12.429> everything

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
drama music singing and and everything

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.180 
drama music singing and and everything
and<00:00:13.120> so<00:00:13.620> Princeton<00:00:14.620> really<00:00:14.799> does<00:00:14.919> a<00:00:14.950> great<00:00:15.099> job

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
and so Princeton really does a great job

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.430 
and so Princeton really does a great job
of<00:00:15.400> nurturing<00:00:15.820> that<00:00:15.910> and<00:00:16.390> I<00:00:16.510> think<00:00:16.810> that<00:00:17.080> this

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
of nurturing that and I think that this

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.830 
of nurturing that and I think that this
shows<00:00:17.710> a<00:00:17.740> perfect<00:00:18.550> example<00:00:18.640> but<00:00:19.360> no<00:00:19.600> weather

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
shows a perfect example but no weather

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.980 
shows a perfect example but no weather
