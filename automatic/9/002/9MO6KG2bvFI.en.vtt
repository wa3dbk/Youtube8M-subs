go that's that craftsmanship see that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.010 
go that's that craftsmanship see that
string<00:01:27.330> sticking<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:30.509> tongue<00:01:30.900> you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
string sticking out on the tongue you

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.289 
string sticking out on the tongue you
have<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.229> black<00:01:31.409> jumpman<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.820> red<00:01:33.060> mesh
