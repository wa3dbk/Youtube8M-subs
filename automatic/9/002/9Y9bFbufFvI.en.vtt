00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.880
 first of August many cities 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.399
 Western Siberia for a few minutes 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:04.850
 organizations 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.899
 this day the sun the moon and the earth will turn out 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.419
 over culture 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:10.449
 we have a country of great merit will close 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.809
 sun disk really short 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.959
 deputy so this is celestial mechanics 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.719
 will have to watch in Siberia and 

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:17.560
 in Ukraine 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.930
 on the eve of the eclipse will reach hundreds 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.470
 scientists 5 thousand astronomy lovers 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.090
 from all over the world 3 international 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.260
 and expedition basically later 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.369
 Novosibirsk extends 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.820
 in biysk 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.170
 generally a solar eclipse 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.840
 used by scientists 2001 not new 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.270
 instrumentation and modeling 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.000
 space experiments 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.720
 one of the main research will be 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.670
 studying the sun crown but apparently 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.130
 the crown and the white light is actually 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.120
 and there is 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.330
 electron fluxes 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.200
 which is distributed in 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.910
 interplanetary space 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.440
 if the earth is found on their 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.510
 the ways naturally came across otherwise 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.630
 an attitude 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.940
 these are the very electrons with which 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.800
 clear now and space weather 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.860
 in the twenty first century here and digital 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.580
 technology we are increasingly dependent on 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.380
 the sun 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.640
 but can affect the operation of any technology 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.000
 from power station to cell phones 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.830
 according to statistics during solar 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.290
 activity increases the number 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.500
 all kinds of disasters 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.590
 the duration of the total phase of the eclipse 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.260
 two to seven minutes so all 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.250
 research scientists need to be very 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.780
 quickly in a short time will pass the whole 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.960
 kaleidoscope of unique 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.470
 optical phenomena running money 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.240
 the so-called left wheel on 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.100
 horizon and diamond ring 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.330
 on the system itself in general i am here by experience 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.340
 Observations this of course is very strong 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.690
 the universe is so emotional 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.660
 shock when suddenly among the clear 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.800
 days percent 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.940
 fades daylight we render 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.900
 in absolute 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.090
 almost at night the one who has ever watched 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.700
 total solar eclipse will 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.610
 striving to repeat this experience helps 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.890
 to specialists 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.990
 now a long time ago from the whole group the sun 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.640
 fans calling themselves 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.710
 Georgian hunters 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.750
 in search of impression not willing to move 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.009
 from place to place 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.949
 in the first of August will be sure 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.679
 are finished 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:14.649
 but among them there are small patches 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:16.029
 scientists who 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.939
 besides that, but here 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.959
 aesthetic satisfaction is all 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.489
 try to get 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.149
 some new sun data 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.189
 astronomers advise not to miss the unique 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.260
 happening 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.129
 see the main astronomical 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.869
 event of the year 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:31.559
 the more so next time on 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.669
 the territory of Russia total eclipse will be 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:34.849
 half a century only
