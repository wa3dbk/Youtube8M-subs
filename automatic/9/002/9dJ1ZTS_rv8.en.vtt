00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.510 

Thanksgiving<00:00:11.620> was<00:00:11.740> it<00:00:11.830> really<00:00:12.040> was<00:00:12.309> a<00:00:12.370> big

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.520 
Thanksgiving was it really was a big

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.430 
Thanksgiving was it really was a big
deal<00:00:12.670> when<00:00:13.180> I<00:00:13.270> was<00:00:13.389> growing<00:00:13.600> up<00:00:13.690> turkeys<00:00:14.139> is

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
deal when I was growing up turkeys is

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.870 
deal when I was growing up turkeys is
pretty<00:00:14.680> much<00:00:14.770> a<00:00:14.830> given<00:00:15.010> so<00:00:15.280> I<00:00:15.340> think<00:00:15.430> the<00:00:15.639> sides

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
pretty much a given so I think the sides

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
sort of a little bit unexpected but

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.890 
sort of a little bit unexpected but
still<00:00:21.160> keeping<00:00:21.550> with<00:00:21.790> what<00:00:22.029> they're<00:00:22.240> hoping

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
little scattering of the pepitas or

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.959 
little scattering of the pepitas or
pumpkin<00:00:49.690> seeds<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:51.280> I<00:00:51.340> can<00:00:51.489> tell<00:00:51.640> we<00:00:51.730> got<00:00:51.879> them

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
pumpkin seeds and I can tell we got them

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.910 
pumpkin seeds and I can tell we got them
just<00:00:52.149> right<00:00:52.270> by<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.600> way<00:00:52.750> they're<00:00:52.960> crunching

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
just right by the way they're crunching

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.340 
just right by the way they're crunching
so<00:00:54.910> it's<00:00:55.030> really<00:00:55.239> more<00:00:55.360> about<00:00:55.420> assembling<00:00:56.170> and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
so it's really more about assembling and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.569 
so it's really more about assembling and
kind<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.559> layering<00:00:57.010> all<00:00:57.190> those<00:00:57.309> ingredients

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
kind of layering all those ingredients

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.400 
kind of layering all those ingredients
each<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.149> which<00:00:58.270> is<00:00:58.390> gonna<00:00:58.510> bring<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.840> different

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
each of which is gonna bring a different

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.380 
each of which is gonna bring a different
flavor<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.789> we<00:01:00.850> have<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.030> dish<00:01:01.149> to<00:01:01.270> be

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
flavor so we have the dish to be

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.639 
flavor so we have the dish to be
thinking<00:01:01.690> of<00:01:01.809> for<00:01:01.960> Thanksgiving<00:01:02.410> is<00:01:02.530> some

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
thinking of for Thanksgiving is some

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.229 
thinking of for Thanksgiving is some
kind<00:01:02.829> of<00:01:02.890> some<00:01:03.039> kind<00:01:03.070> of<00:01:03.219> green<00:01:03.460> vegetable<00:01:04.000> you

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
kind of some kind of green vegetable you

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.279 
kind of some kind of green vegetable you
know<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.360> think<00:01:04.449> it's<00:01:04.629> hard<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:04.930> be<00:01:05.020> the<00:01:05.140> thing

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
know I think it's hard to be the thing

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:06.930 
know I think it's hard to be the thing
to<00:01:05.440> be<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.800> green<00:01:05.979> vegetable<00:01:06.490> on<00:01:06.670> the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
to be the green vegetable on the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.850 
to be the green vegetable on the
Thanksgiving<00:01:07.600> tables<00:01:08.170> there's<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:08.500> much<00:01:08.649> to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
Thanksgiving tables there's so much to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.190 
Thanksgiving tables there's so much to
compete<00:01:09.220> with<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:09.850> just<00:01:09.880> took<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.450> blue<00:01:11.020> lake

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
compete with so just took the blue lake

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.650 
compete with so just took the blue lake
beans<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:11.800> then<00:01:12.430> cook<00:01:12.940> those<00:01:13.119> for<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.450> long

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
beans and then cook those for a long

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.039 
beans and then cook those for a long
time<00:01:13.960> with<00:01:14.140> wedges<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:14.890> onion<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:16.570> garlic<00:01:16.750> and

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
time with wedges of onion and garlic and

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.780 
time with wedges of onion and garlic and
then<00:01:17.229> herbs<00:01:17.560> big<00:01:17.920> pieces<00:01:18.220> of<00:01:18.490> sage<00:01:18.760> and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
then herbs big pieces of sage and

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.039 
then herbs big pieces of sage and
rosemary<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:19.689> thyme

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
rosemary and thyme

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.719 
rosemary and thyme
I<00:01:20.350> think<00:01:20.650> texture<00:01:21.010> is<00:01:21.100> such<00:01:21.280> an<00:01:21.400> important

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
I think texture is such an important

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.250 
I think texture is such an important
part<00:01:21.880> of<00:01:22.030> how<00:01:22.150> we<00:01:22.210> enjoy<00:01:22.600> food<00:01:22.900> it's<00:01:23.170> the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
part of how we enjoy food it's the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.350 
part of how we enjoy food it's the
texture<00:01:23.650> of<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:24.369> beans<00:01:24.549> themselves<00:01:24.700> but<00:01:25.210> then

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
texture of the beans themselves but then

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.570 
texture of the beans themselves but then
also<00:01:25.540> of<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.049> onion<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.560> garlic<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:27.100> the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
also of the onion and the garlic and the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.800 
also of the onion and the garlic and the
herbs<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:28.030> sort<00:01:28.150> of<00:01:28.180> thinking<00:01:28.479> of<00:01:28.570> all<00:01:28.689> those

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
herbs and sort of thinking of all those

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.240 
herbs and sort of thinking of all those
elements<00:01:29.020> especially<00:01:29.770> when<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:29.979> food<00:01:30.159> is

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
elements especially when the food is

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.070 
elements especially when the food is
really<00:01:30.460> simple<00:01:30.850> it's<00:01:31.479> really<00:01:31.689> important<00:01:31.990> to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
really simple it's really important to

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.109 
really simple it's really important to
kind<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.320> nail<00:01:32.500> all<00:01:32.710> those<00:01:32.890> all<00:01:33.640> those<00:01:33.880> moments

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
kind of nail all those all those moments

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.820 
kind of nail all those all those moments
