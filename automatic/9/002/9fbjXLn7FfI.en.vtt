00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
are just straight out of the punch the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.680 
are just straight out of the punch the
next<00:02:08.959> ones<00:02:09.229> I've<00:02:10.129> made<00:02:10.640> three<00:02:11.090> dimensional

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
next ones I've made three dimensional

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.510 
next ones I've made three dimensional
and<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:11.960> don't<00:02:12.170> know<00:02:12.290> if<00:02:12.380> you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
and I don't know if you

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.940 
and I don't know if you
until<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.000> center<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:15.780> as<00:02:16.780> punched<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.560> pushed

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
until the center is as punched is pushed

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.210 
until the center is as punched is pushed
in<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.490> petals<00:02:18.850> pop<00:02:19.180> out<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.890> third<00:02:20.890> way

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
in in the petals pop out and third way

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.080 
in in the petals pop out and third way
you<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.610> present<00:02:22.030> them<00:02:22.270> as<00:02:22.710> very<00:02:23.710> 3d<00:02:24.460> this

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
you can present them as very 3d this

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.730 
you can present them as very 3d this
doesn't<00:02:25.330> go<00:02:25.570> well<00:02:25.600> through<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.140> mail<00:02:26.320> but<00:02:26.590> if

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
doesn't go well through the mail but if

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.040 
doesn't go well through the mail but if
you're<00:02:26.920> doing<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.580> project<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.510> want<00:02:28.750> some

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
you're doing a project and you want some

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.350 
you're doing a project and you want some
three-dimensional<00:02:29.380> flowers<00:02:30.220> those<00:02:31.000> ones<00:02:31.210> are

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
three-dimensional flowers those ones are

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.390 
three-dimensional flowers those ones are
even<00:02:31.690> more<00:02:31.900> three<00:02:32.170> dimensional<00:02:32.200> these<00:02:33.160> ones

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
even more three dimensional these ones

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.680 
even more three dimensional these ones
here<00:02:33.550> we'll<00:02:33.730> go<00:02:33.850> through<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.210> mail<00:02:34.420> and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
here we'll go through the mail and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.220 
here we'll go through the mail and
retain<00:02:35.230> their<00:02:36.160> pop<00:02:36.610> governess<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:38.020> I'm<00:02:38.140> going

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
retain their pop governess so I'm going

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.380 
retain their pop governess so I'm going
to<00:02:38.470> show<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.740> today<00:02:38.800> how<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.310> quickly<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:40.150> that

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
to show you today how to quickly do that

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.500 
to show you today how to quickly do that
obviously<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.530> first<00:02:41.800> way<00:02:42.070> takes<00:02:43.000> no<00:02:43.210> time<00:02:43.450> at

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
obviously the first way takes no time at

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.150 
obviously the first way takes no time at
all<00:02:44.640> using<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:45.790> little<00:02:46.120> Matt<00:02:46.330> pack<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.710> some

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
all using this little Matt pack and some

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.060 
all using this little Matt pack and some
think<00:02:48.550> it's<00:02:48.700> $15<00:02:49.540> it's<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.380> very<00:02:50.620> handy<00:02:51.040> tool

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
think it's $15 it's a very handy tool

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.920 
think it's $15 it's a very handy tool
this<00:02:51.700> makes<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.840> stitches<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.770> and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
this makes the stitches and and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.060 
this makes the stitches and and
decorates<00:02:55.930> cards<00:02:56.410> but<00:02:56.560> we're<00:02:56.680> not<00:02:56.800> going<00:02:56.830> to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
use that piece we're just using the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.370 
use that piece we're just using the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
a big tip in a small tip I use the large

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.830 
a big tip in a small tip I use the large

it over press each of these cuddles like
this<00:03:20.320> just<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.490> the<00:03:21.640> center<00:03:22.090> I've<00:03:22.360> seen<00:03:23.050> people

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
this just in the center I've seen people

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.930 
this just in the center I've seen people
who<00:03:23.560> go<00:03:23.770> round<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.160> round<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.550> it's<00:03:24.700> not

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
who go round and round it it's not

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.720 
who go round and round it it's not
necessary<00:03:25.980> actually<00:03:26.980> finish<00:03:27.370> with<00:03:27.610> the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
necessary actually finish with the

necessary actually finish with the
center<00:03:28.090> one<00:03:28.300> works<00:03:28.540> better<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.200> now<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.100> can

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
center one works better and now you can

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.630 
center one works better and now you can
put<00:03:31.360> your<00:03:31.600> little<00:03:32.500> dot<00:03:32.830> in<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.370> really

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
put your little dot in it that really

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.580 
put your little dot in it that really
does<00:03:33.880> show<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.240> it<00:03:34.600> looks<00:03:34.840> much<00:03:35.080> more<00:03:35.350> like<00:03:35.410> a

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
does show that it looks much more like a

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.140 
does show that it looks much more like a
flower<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.920> can<00:03:39.130> do<00:03:39.220> other<00:03:39.400> things<00:03:39.520> with<00:03:39.880> as

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
flower you can do other things with as

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.440 
flower you can do other things with as
well<00:03:40.360> at<00:03:40.540> this<00:03:40.720> point<00:03:41.160> but<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.760> can<00:03:42.940> now<00:03:43.090> go<00:03:43.300> on

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
well at this point but it can now go on

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.890 
well at this point but it can now go on
a<00:03:43.510> card<00:03:43.780> like<00:03:44.020> that<00:03:44.320> very<00:03:44.709> nicely<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.600> takes

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
a card like that very nicely so it takes

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.040 
a card like that very nicely so it takes
a<00:03:47.080> bit<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.290> time<00:03:47.410> again<00:03:47.920> I'll<00:03:48.070> show<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:49.050> did

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
a bit of time again I'll show you I did

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.199 
a bit of time again I'll show you I did
it<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:50.290> little<00:03:50.380> backwards<00:03:50.920> do<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.340> petals

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
it a little backwards do the petals

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.080 
it a little backwards do the petals
first<00:03:54.270> and<00:03:55.270> then<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.380> center<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.880> just

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
first and then the center and it just

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.610 
first and then the center and it just
sort<00:03:58.270> of<00:03:58.300> makes<00:03:58.360> them<00:03:58.780> pop<00:03:59.050> out<00:03:59.260> they<00:03:59.470> look

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
sort of makes them pop out they look

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.970 
sort of makes them pop out they look
quite<00:03:59.800> real<00:04:00.100> life<00:04:00.340> realistic<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.240> think<00:04:01.800> so<00:04:02.800> the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
quite real life realistic I think so the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.680 
quite real life realistic I think so the
next<00:04:03.340> way<00:04:03.520> looks<00:04:04.180> simplest<00:04:04.959> but<00:04:06.300> very<00:04:07.300> press

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
next way looks simplest but very press

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.380 
next way looks simplest but very press
very<00:04:07.959> hard<00:04:08.140> right<00:04:08.590> in<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.770> center<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:09.459> now

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
very hard right in the center and now

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.090 
very hard right in the center and now
your<00:04:10.600> flower<00:04:10.840> pops<00:04:11.260> right<00:04:11.560> out<00:04:12.540> looks<00:04:13.540> like

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
your flower pops right out looks like

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.770
