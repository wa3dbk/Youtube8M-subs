runescape<00:01:54.340> right<00:01:54.490> now<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.820> just<00:01:54.880> boring<00:01:55.240> so

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
runescape right now is just boring so

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.250 
runescape right now is just boring so
future<00:01:57.730> directions<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.300> channel<00:01:58.720> I<00:01:58.900> might

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
future directions of the channel I might

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.710 
future directions of the channel I might
start<00:01:59.920> doing<00:02:00.160> some<00:02:00.310> real<00:02:00.460> life<00:02:00.640> blogs<00:02:00.940> if<00:02:01.420> time

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
start doing some real life blogs if time

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.490 
start doing some real life blogs if time
permits<00:02:02.080> and<00:02:03.390> maybe<00:02:04.390> after<00:02:04.900> that<00:02:05.080> you'll<00:02:05.290> see

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
permits and maybe after that you'll see

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.410 
permits and maybe after that you'll see
is<00:02:05.560> released<00:02:05.890> i<00:02:06.100> might<00:02:06.310> do<00:02:06.430> a<00:02:06.460> few<00:02:06.760> review

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
is released i might do a few review

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.290 
is released i might do a few review
videos<00:02:07.720> on<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:07.990> EOC<00:02:08.470> it's<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:09.009> good<00:02:09.220> enough<00:02:09.490> but

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
videos on the EOC it's a good enough but

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.170 
videos on the EOC it's a good enough but
currently<00:02:10.720> one<00:02:11.080> defense<00:02:11.470> got<00:02:12.250> got<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.880> HP

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
currently one defense got got the HP

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.480 
currently one defense got got the HP
boost<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> 4,000<00:02:14.350> HP<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:14.920> they<00:02:15.040> can<00:02:15.160> do<00:02:15.310> stuff

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
boost to a 4,000 HP so they can do stuff

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.370 
boost to a 4,000 HP so they can do stuff
like<00:02:15.580> next<00:02:15.970> again<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.660> one<00:02:16.840> defense<00:02:17.200> isn't

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
like next again so one defense isn't

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.680 
like next again so one defense isn't
really<00:02:17.740> dead<00:02:17.920> contrary<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:18.910> what<00:02:19.120> people<00:02:19.330> say

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
really dead contrary to what people say

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.470 
really dead contrary to what people say
currently<00:02:20.200> but<00:02:20.940> let's<00:02:21.940> see<00:02:22.060> what<00:02:22.090> happens

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
currently but let's see what happens

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.180 
currently but let's see what happens
there<00:02:22.690> still<00:02:22.900> room<00:02:23.260> for<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.530> lot<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.739> changes<00:02:24.070> so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
there still room for a lot of changes so

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.290 
there still room for a lot of changes so
one<00:02:24.340> defense<00:02:24.670> could<00:02:24.820> be<00:02:24.880> dead<00:02:25.030> by<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.239> time

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
one defense could be dead by the time

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.220 
one defense could be dead by the time
the<00:02:25.570> EOC<00:02:25.870> goes<00:02:26.170> life<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.720> yeah<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.810> think<00:02:28.900> we<00:02:29.080> cut

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
the EOC goes life so yeah I think we cut

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.610 
the EOC goes life so yeah I think we cut
the<00:02:29.320> video<00:02:29.410> here<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:30.450> remember<00:02:31.450> guys<00:02:31.750> if<00:02:32.230> you

science<00:02:53.380> section<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.250> jumped<00:02:54.640> up<00:02:54.790> by<00:02:55.510> four

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
science section I jumped up by four

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.509 
science section I jumped up by four
points<00:02:55.930> just<00:02:56.350> because<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.650> spent<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.280> lot<00:02:57.310> of

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
points just because I spent a lot of

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.490 
points just because I spent a lot of
time<00:02:57.640> studying<00:02:57.940> so<00:02:58.720> hopefully<00:02:59.080> by<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.260> time<00:02:59.320> I

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
time studying so hopefully by the time I

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.380 
time studying so hopefully by the time I
take<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.799> test<00:03:00.040> i'll<00:03:00.220> be<00:03:00.340> maybe<00:03:00.790> getting<00:03:01.269> to

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
take the test i'll be maybe getting to

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.710 
take the test i'll be maybe getting to
13<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.900> 14<00:03:02.350> both<00:03:02.920> scientists<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.720> hopefully

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
13 to 14 both scientists and hopefully

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.650 
13 to 14 both scientists and hopefully
at<00:03:04.870> least<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.650> nine<00:03:05.830> or<00:03:06.010> ten<00:03:06.340> on<00:03:06.519> verbal<00:03:06.910> I'm

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
at least a and nine or ten on verbal I'm

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.540 
at least a and nine or ten on verbal I'm
hoping<00:03:08.140> for

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.900
