00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.900
 but a little coffee shop, that's okay 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.130
 better and Melchior come 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.779
 today the main thing is the strawberry make 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.820
 a strawberry caipirinha 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.380
 I do not think that basic also 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.240
 Anywhere because from here I've learned 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.769
 niterói rio de janeiro at friend's house 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.570
 my 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:35.610
 Come on, take the strawberry cut in 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.170
 pieces and will put in the lap without 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.180
 do not have the back to the load have to stay 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.219
 red strawberry line beautiful 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.480
 but let's just put a lot of 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:53.360
 strawberry in here and now comes the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:58.500
 part of the secrets that ginger 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.739
 can use the ubuntu ginger slice it 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.449
 to help because we're going to take him out 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.000
 cool, you'll pull the notary's office 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.409
 take caipirinha and 99 pieces of 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.040
 indebtedness to the mouth 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.790
 this will give a different taste of the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.790
 Caipirinha Of Strawberry 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.150
 I would say strawberry from Niterói that was there 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.350
 I learned one to two tablespoons of 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.630
 sugar is essential and we will have to 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.030
 it will be well 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.030
 it will incorporate the two flavors 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:49.750
 ready 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:53.890
 come on ice crushed to the ice 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.430
 chopped you make your own kneader 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.430
 of primer 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.330
 here you also choose either the vodka or the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.400
 Sugarcane liquor 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:13.510
 I always choose the vodka hello 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:16.900
 and that Mexico 11 Jan is the head of 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.690
 all stay uniform 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.880
 now enough to mess around like 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.200
 Putting up the Itau comes vibrating. 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.630
 Look how her color is already being 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.690
 wonderful and we end up with a 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.930
 little piece of strawberry we go 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.260
 put on the edge of the glass 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.140
