00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.090 
carbohydrates and then i'll be doing
that<00:02:47.330> for<00:02:47.540> four<00:02:47.780> days<00:02:47.959> today's<00:02:48.500> my<00:02:48.680> second<00:02:49.010> day

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
that for four days today's my second day

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.420 
that for four days today's my second day
of<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.640> then<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.600> twenty-third<00:02:51.430> my

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
of that and then on the twenty-third my

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.789 
of that and then on the twenty-third my
carbs<00:02:52.970> drop<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.790> 165<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.650> my<00:02:57.920> calories<00:02:58.489> go<00:02:59.000> to

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
carbs drop to 165 and my calories go to

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.120 
carbs drop to 165 and my calories go to
17<00:03:00.799> 25<00:03:01.400> which<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:01.700> only<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.660> 25<00:03:03.470> calorie<00:03:03.830> drop

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
17 25 which is only a 25 calorie drop

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.970 
17 25 which is only a 25 calorie drop
whatever<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:05.060> but<00:03:05.900> it'll<00:03:06.290> probably<00:03:06.410> be<00:03:06.709> under

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
whatever and but it'll probably be under

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.259 
whatever and but it'll probably be under
that<00:03:07.100> because<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:07.430> just<00:03:07.700> thoughts<00:03:07.940> like<00:03:08.060> my

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
that because I just thoughts like my

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.840 
that because I just thoughts like my
maximum<00:03:08.810> calories<00:03:09.310> it'll<00:03:10.310> be<00:03:10.400> like<00:03:10.519> that<00:03:10.670> for

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
maximum calories it'll be like that for

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.030 
maximum calories it'll be like that for
four<00:03:11.000> days<00:03:11.120> then<00:03:11.780> next<00:03:12.049> saturday<00:03:12.530> i<00:03:12.560> dropped

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
four days then next saturday i dropped

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.009 
four days then next saturday i dropped
to<00:03:13.160> 155<00:03:13.940> calories<00:03:14.930> at<00:03:16.420> 1650<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:17.750> i<00:03:17.780> have<00:03:17.989> a

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
to 155 calories at 1650 so i have a

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.979 
to 155 calories at 1650 so i have a
little<00:03:18.260> bit<00:03:18.380> more<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.560> significant<00:03:19.400> and

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
little bit more a significant and

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.280 
little bit more a significant and
calorie<00:03:20.989> drop<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.650> then<00:03:22.660> i'll<00:03:23.660> do<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:24.049> for<00:03:24.530> 0

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
calorie drop and then i'll do that for 0

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.500 
calorie drop and then i'll do that for 0
for<00:03:27.290> 3<00:03:27.709> days<00:03:27.890> only<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.640> then<00:03:28.910> on<00:03:29.209> the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
for 3 days only and then on the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.910 
for 3 days only and then on the
thirtieth<00:03:29.989> of<00:03:30.170> September<00:03:30.829> I<00:03:31.040> dropped<00:03:31.450> 145

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
thirtieth of September I dropped 145

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.289 
thirtieth of September I dropped 145
carbs<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:35.950> 1580<00:03:36.950> calories<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.670> think<00:03:38.030> that's

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
carbs and 1580 calories I think that's

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.960 
carbs and 1580 calories I think that's
as<00:03:38.480> low<00:03:38.660> as<00:03:38.690> i'm<00:03:38.930> gonna<00:03:39.079> go<00:03:39.730> sorry<00:03:40.730> their

little bit I don't I actually don't know
if<00:04:19.459> I'm<00:04:19.549> an<00:04:19.699> increase<00:04:20.000> in<00:04:20.030> my<00:04:20.180> calories<00:04:20.570> we'll

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
if I'm an increase in my calories we'll

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.040 
if I'm an increase in my calories we'll
see<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.320> I<00:04:22.220> imagine<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.880> little<00:04:23.060> bit<00:04:23.360> but<00:04:23.630> since

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
see and I imagine a little bit but since

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.650 
see and I imagine a little bit but since
my<00:04:24.229> protein<00:04:24.979> is<00:04:25.100> at<00:04:25.220> 150<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.030> can<00:04:26.300> afford<00:04:26.539> to

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
my protein is at 150 I can afford to

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.110 
my protein is at 150 I can afford to
drop<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:26.960> by<00:04:27.320> 30<00:04:27.560> grams<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:28.699> maybe<00:04:28.970> i'll

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
drop that by 30 grams and so maybe i'll

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.939 
drop that by 30 grams and so maybe i'll
just<00:04:29.300> change<00:04:29.900> out<00:04:30.139> the<00:04:30.289> two<00:04:30.440> maybe<00:04:30.770> i'll

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
just change out the two maybe i'll

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.879 
just change out the two maybe i'll
increase<00:04:31.190> carbs<00:04:31.699> by<00:04:31.940> 30<00:04:32.240> lower<00:04:32.539> protein<00:04:33.260> by<00:04:33.620> 30

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
increase carbs by 30 lower protein by 30

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.610 
increase carbs by 30 lower protein by 30
that<00:04:34.190> way<00:04:34.310> my<00:04:34.539> calories<00:04:35.539> stay<00:04:35.840> down<00:04:36.110> but<00:04:36.410> maybe

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
that way my calories stay down but maybe

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.310 
that way my calories stay down but maybe
I<00:04:36.740> can<00:04:36.949> suck<00:04:37.460> in<00:04:37.669> some<00:04:38.030> carbs<00:04:38.570> into<00:04:38.870> my<00:04:38.990> muscle

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
I can suck in some carbs into my muscle

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.129 
I can suck in some carbs into my muscle
I<00:04:39.470> don't<00:04:39.650> really<00:04:39.770> know<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.419> really<00:04:41.419> like<00:04:41.630> that
