whoa get turned on baby it's weird using

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.980 
whoa get turned on baby it's weird using
the<00:05:42.440> the<00:05:42.889> r2<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.460> l2<00:05:43.580> is<00:05:44.030> aim<00:05:44.240> down<00:05:44.419> sight<00:05:44.810> and

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
the the r2 and l2 is aim down sight and

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.830 
the the r2 and l2 is aim down sight and
stuff<00:05:45.259> I<00:05:46.389> don't<00:05:47.389> know<00:05:47.449> it<00:05:47.570> just<00:05:47.600> feels

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
stuff I don't know it just feels

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.240 
stuff I don't know it just feels
different<00:05:48.020> this<00:05:48.470> controller<00:05:48.830> just<00:05:49.009> feels

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
different this controller just feels

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.420 
different this controller just feels
really<00:05:49.550> different<00:05:50.770> which<00:05:51.770> again<00:05:52.009> is<00:05:52.190> to<00:05:52.310> be

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
really different which again is to be

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.279 
really different which again is to be
expected<00:05:52.759> this<00:05:53.539> is<00:05:53.660> the<00:05:53.750> first<00:05:53.960> time<00:05:54.169> I'm

expected this is the first time I'm
truly<00:05:54.530> like<00:05:54.650> I<00:05:54.740> used<00:05:54.979> it<00:05:55.100> a<00:05:55.190> couple<00:05:55.460> of<00:05:55.550> events

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
truly like I used it a couple of events

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.469 
truly like I used it a couple of events
but<00:05:57.370> for<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:58.430> most<00:05:58.639> part<00:05:58.910> this<00:05:59.000> is<00:05:59.060> my<00:05:59.150> first
