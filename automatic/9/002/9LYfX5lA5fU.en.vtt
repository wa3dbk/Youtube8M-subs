00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
few minutes all right let's let's get

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.380 
few minutes all right let's let's get
out<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.100> don't<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:24.119> much

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
out of here so we don't really have much

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.240 
out of here so we don't really have much
time<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:24.869> not<00:01:24.990> sure<00:01:25.200> how<00:01:25.350> long<00:01:25.530> that'll<00:01:26.130> take

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
time I'm not sure how long that'll take

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.740 
time I'm not sure how long that'll take
him<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.700> break<00:01:26.880> through<00:01:27.119> its<00:01:27.240> pretty<00:01:27.540> high<00:01:27.720> up

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
him to break through its pretty high up

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.109 
him to break through its pretty high up
there<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.259> if<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> breaks<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:29.040> it'll<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:30.000> will

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
there so if it breaks one it'll it will

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.510 
there so if it breaks one it'll it will
replace<00:01:30.420> itself<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> while<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.250> we

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
replace itself for a while but we we

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.850 
replace itself for a while but we we
need<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.759> move<00:01:32.880> fast<00:01:33.090> ok<00:01:33.450> stop<00:01:33.840> talking<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.380> have
