 Even cdj or so recently pcg 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:30.920
 There are various things like this, but this time I see 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.870

 I'd like to introduce you to d pcdj controller at the want to show you Well immediately 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.230
 I think 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.780
 solo 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.290
 Already 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.340
 Something 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.340
 I have got it but this 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:54.170
 Yeah but it is ipad like the pop 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:54.170
 Fen also But the mark of logo Nde there is no such color 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.190
 I wonder if the swamp is 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.680
 put out android 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.350
 Really thinking person 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.800
 It is a controller 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.350
 Yes 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.210
 Actually this controller just appeared in October of 2013 in October of this year 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.920
 At the controller 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.040
 It is new beginning 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.360
 The name is this, but it is outside the box 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.470
 Mitaka truck h 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.470
 It becomes a product called 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:35.520
 In short the latest technology 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.890
 I wonder if this is an item that is packed with here and the edgy item is this 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.490
 I think 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.490
 I think it is amazing the place is first I thought that it is this thin 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.920
 Well, you generally do understand you Gunfuyu Bitch trial 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:57.740
 Surgery I feel it 's such a mon Dehai 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.740
 Actually, the film is good . It is only seven centimeters, which is good for 17 ships . 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:08.320
 The other is in the other probably dj controller 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.420
 Personally I wonder if it is the thinnest and I think it is not the thinnest at this stage 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.020
 I think 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.280
 If this one 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.819
 How about this controller if you have a PC 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.160
 It will be a product that dj can easily 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.130
 so 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.819
 Though only thinness still stands out 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.770
 How about yesterday 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:35.560
 I think I think 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:40.080
 Real despite the I Is this Kondake thin but I know yesterday 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.080
 Audio interface is built in 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.700
 To be positive 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:52.280
 That Well or Dattari audio 2 When did Toka tractor 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:58.990
 There are 10 and so on , but it looks like an audio interface box like that 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:02.870
 In order to not take out clean to clean in order to put that audio sound 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:08.299
 I have the necessary equipment but it is already built in 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.860
 So it's already a cable wife and a post PC that connects this controller and the back speaker 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.990
 If you have a computer, you can do dj 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:19.350
 It will be consumption 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:21.520
 Let's start to explain how to use this controller 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.940
 I'm sorry 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.400
 I think people who start dj are especially true 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.099
 Isn't it quite difficult to connect? 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.099
 This Please look this is but I think 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.470
 Side is also not about only two little less rain 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.060
 I just have one more here 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.060
 I can do dj just by this 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.830
 In this jack from now, of course fulfill what function 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.870
 Maa's 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.010
 I would like to explain 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.510
 Yes for this elm 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.200
 Mex's cage 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:08.799
 The included control pcdj software is increasing 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.799
 You are not virtual dj let you 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.209
 This is attached and attached. 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:21.810
 Yeah It is prima facie 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:25.770
 If you go to the blank numark's headquarters page 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.870
 track name a from a instruments 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:33.790
 pcdj soft tractor 2 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.289
 There is also a midi batting file that can be used here 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.149
 Because 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:42.820
 If you usually use a tractor dj, download it 

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:47.290
 Get it here 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:53.130
 You can use it with a tractor You can basically use just that virtual 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.130
 dj led so much so I want to use this time 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:01.690
 Connection is easy First of all 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.990
 Often is this I This jack is seen in either the iphone 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.449
 Is the cable that is connected with the speaker this 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.280
 I stab this master 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.610
 Yes 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.710
 so 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:18.110
 It is cable of PC usb cave 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.300
 Though it is included with such attachment, PC and tea usb 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.050
 Connect this 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.229
 It was lighted 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:30.610
 It is another last hole 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:32.529
 head for mark comes with it is here headphones 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.370
 Please let me follow 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.300
 Yes 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:40.590
 Just this 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:46.130
 It is an environment where dj can be made in an environment where sound can be output. 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.130
 It may not be strange to say that the real world is the end
