00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
awfully long time and android 4.4 is

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.140 
awfully long time and android 4.4 is

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
very compatible with older hardware so

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.090 
very compatible with older hardware so
hopefully<00:02:32.960> we<00:02:33.080> will<00:02:33.260> start<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.560> see<00:02:33.680> older

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
hopefully we will start to see older

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.650 
hopefully we will start to see older
hardware<00:02:34.280> become<00:02:34.880> more<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.120> more<00:02:35.180> supportive

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
hardware become more and more supportive

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
up for the camera that developers can

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.970 
up for the camera that developers can
tap<00:03:11.300> into<00:03:11.510> this<00:03:11.960> should<00:03:12.110> also<00:03:12.260> be<00:03:12.500> coming<00:03:12.740> into

tap into this should also be coming into
the<00:03:13.100> default<00:03:13.400> camera<00:03:13.700> as<00:03:13.940> well<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.810> will

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
the default camera as well that will

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.530 
the default camera as well that will
enable<00:03:15.140> Rahl<00:03:15.530> support<00:03:16.100> which<00:03:16.490> is<00:03:16.670> amazing<00:03:17.030> and

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
enable Rahl support which is amazing and

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.200 
enable Rahl support which is amazing and
will<00:03:17.810> enable<00:03:17.990> burst<00:03:18.530> mode<00:03:18.890> shooting<00:03:19.340> now<00:03:19.880> in

they're<00:03:26.270> not<00:03:26.420> really<00:03:26.630> that<00:03:26.870> great<00:03:27.200> it<00:03:27.410> really

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
they're not really that great it really

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
about this the one thing I'm really

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.600 
about this the one thing I'm really
curious<00:03:32.660> about<00:03:32.900> cell<00:03:33.830> phone<00:03:34.010> camera<00:03:34.310> sensors

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
curious about cell phone camera sensors

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.670 
curious about cell phone camera sensors
are<00:03:34.820> notoriously<00:03:35.210> small<00:03:35.990> because<00:03:36.380> cell

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
are notoriously small because cell

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.800 
are notoriously small because cell
phones<00:03:36.920> are<00:03:37.130> small<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:38.150> area<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.630> have

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
phones are small and the area to have

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.650 
phones are small and the area to have
for<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.080> is<00:03:39.290> small<00:03:39.800> so<00:03:40.490> it's<00:03:41.240> nice<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.600> be

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
for that is small so it's nice to be

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.180 
for that is small so it's nice to be
able<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.900> maximize<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.560> potential<00:03:42.860> of<00:03:43.160> what

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
able to maximize the potential of what

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.320 
able to maximize the potential of what
you're<00:03:43.430> going<00:03:43.550> to<00:03:43.610> be<00:03:43.670> able<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.880> get<00:03:43.970> out<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.120> it

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
you're going to be able to get out of it

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.660 
you're going to be able to get out of it
but<00:03:44.900> i<00:03:44.959> would<00:03:45.260> still<00:03:45.500> foresee<00:03:46.070> it<00:03:46.220> not<00:03:46.400> being

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
but i would still foresee it not being

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.120 
but i would still foresee it not being
amazing<00:03:47.420> but<00:03:48.020> still<00:03:48.380> if<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.590> can<00:03:48.740> take<00:03:48.860> a

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
amazing but still if you can take a

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.449 
amazing but still if you can take a
really<00:03:49.790> nice<00:03:50.000> sensor<00:03:50.420> like<00:03:50.600> one<00:03:50.810> in<00:03:51.080> I<00:03:51.860> don't

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
really nice sensor like one in I don't

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.070 
really nice sensor like one in I don't
even<00:03:52.550> know<00:03:52.850> an<00:03:53.180> Android<00:03:53.540> camera<00:03:53.660> that<00:03:53.900> has<00:03:53.959> an

even know an Android camera that has an

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.540

amazing sensor the gala the galaxy note
3<00:03:55.730> has<00:03:55.850> a<00:03:56.000> really<00:03:56.240> good<00:03:56.510> sensor<00:03:56.900> in<00:03:57.050> it<00:03:57.200> if<00:03:57.860> you

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
3 has a really good sensor in it if you

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.949 
3 has a really good sensor in it if you
can<00:03:58.160> pull<00:03:58.340> raw<00:03:58.550> footage<00:03:58.820> out<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.360> that

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
can pull raw footage out of that that

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.660 
can pull raw footage out of that that

realistically<00:04:39.470> what<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.740> application<00:04:40.280> was

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
realistically what the application was

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.730 
realistically what the application was
doing<00:04:40.759> was<00:04:41.090> showing<00:04:41.630> you<00:04:41.750> how<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:41.930> turn<00:04:42.410> on<00:04:42.440> a

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
doing was showing you how to turn on a

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.439 
doing was showing you how to turn on a
DB<00:04:43.009> on<00:04:43.130> your<00:04:43.250> device<00:04:43.490> connected<00:04:44.270> to<00:04:44.330> your

DB on your device connected to your

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.570 
DB on your device connected to your
computer<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:45.050> an<00:04:45.320> application<00:04:46.100> that<00:04:46.130> was<00:04:46.400> not

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
computer so an application that was not

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.270 
computer so an application that was not
on<00:04:46.789> Android<00:04:47.389> could<00:04:48.199> do<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.740> rest<00:04:48.919> of<00:04:49.039> the<00:04:49.130> work

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
on Android could do the rest of the work

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.390 
on Android could do the rest of the work
for<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:49.870> so<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:51.259> was<00:04:51.410> I<00:04:51.650> don't<00:04:52.039> know<00:04:52.190> if<00:04:52.280> it<00:04:52.370> is
