00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.710 
here I actually end up with a decent
flop<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:29.040> afraid<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> bet<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.540> which

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
flop so I'm not afraid to bet here which

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.969 
flop so I'm not afraid to bet here which
is<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.110> i'm<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
is what i'm going to do and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.450 
is what i'm going to do and
unfortunately<00:01:33.350> he<00:01:34.350> called<00:01:34.619> which<00:01:34.890> kind<00:01:35.369> of

unfortunately he called which kind of

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.590 
unfortunately he called which kind of
worries<00:01:35.729> me<00:01:36.650> um<00:01:37.909> seeing<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.390> this

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
worries me um seeing that it is this

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.020 
worries me um seeing that it is this
flop<00:01:39.900> too<00:01:40.110> i<00:01:40.140> think<00:01:40.350> he<00:01:40.770> may<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.159> hit<00:01:41.729> bottom

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
flop too i think he may have hit bottom

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.810 
flop too i think he may have hit bottom
pair<00:01:42.390> or<00:01:42.600> he's<00:01:42.960> got<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> couple<00:01:43.470> clubs<00:01:43.770> or<00:01:44.130> maybe

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
pair or he's got a couple clubs or maybe

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.690

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
when it's early always good to be

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.860
