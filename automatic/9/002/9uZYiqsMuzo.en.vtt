suppressor<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.700> useful<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.299> both<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.750> them

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
suppressor on is useful to both of them

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.410 
suppressor on is useful to both of them
but<00:01:34.140> fuck-ups<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.799> hipfire<00:01:35.009> accuracy<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.329> if

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
but fuck-ups the hipfire accuracy so if

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.030 
but fuck-ups the hipfire accuracy so if
you<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.630> taking<00:01:36.780> hip<00:01:37.170> firing<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> lower

around<00:01:40.290> you're<00:01:40.530> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> bad<00:01:41.189> day

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490

the<00:01:42.060> heavy<00:01:42.299> barrel<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.140> best<00:01:43.470> attachment

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the heavy barrel is the best attachment

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.069 
the heavy barrel is the best attachment
for<00:01:44.369> both<00:01:44.640> weapons<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.570> increases<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
for both weapons as it increases the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.870 
for both weapons as it increases the
bullet<00:01:46.439> spread<00:01:46.619> dramatically<00:01:47.340> imagine<00:01:47.850> that

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
bullet spread dramatically imagine that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.030 
bullet spread dramatically imagine that
it<00:01:48.270> provides<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.930> bullet<00:01:49.229> spread<00:01:49.409> bonus<00:01:49.890> of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it provides a bullet spread bonus of

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.429 
it provides a bullet spread bonus of
seventy-five<00:01:50.880> percent<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.750> every<00:01:52.049> bullet<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
seventy-five percent so every bullet you

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
seventy-five percent so every bullet you
should<00:01:52.649> goes<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> same<00:01:53.399> spot<00:01:53.579> again<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
should goes to the same spot again and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.450 
should goes to the same spot again and
again<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.079> again<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.920> suppressor<00:01:56.430> is

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
again and again the suppressor is

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.789 
again and again the suppressor is
another<00:01:57.030> great<00:01:57.329> attachment<00:01:57.750> for<00:01:58.229> both<00:01:58.469> guns

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
another great attachment for both guns

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.740 
another great attachment for both guns
but<00:01:59.130> keep<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.430> mind<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.790> decreases<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> bullet

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
but keep in mind it decreases the bullet

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.230 
but keep in mind it decreases the bullet
velocity<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.439> damage<00:02:01.890> our<00:02:02.070> range<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.909> killing

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
velocity and damage our range so killing

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.480 
velocity and damage our range so killing
someone<00:02:03.719> at<00:02:03.869> long<00:02:04.259> ranges<00:02:04.619> becomes<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.189> beats

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
someone at long ranges becomes a beats

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.940 
someone at long ranges becomes a beats
both<00:02:06.030> weapons<00:02:06.299> are<00:02:06.659> great<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.259> medium

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
both weapons are great in medium

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.830 
both weapons are great in medium
long-range<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.789> slap<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> foregrip<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
long-range if you slap on a foregrip and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.150 
long-range if you slap on a foregrip and
a<00:02:09.869> heavy<00:02:10.080> barrel<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.649> eliminate<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
a heavy barrel you eliminate the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.949 
a heavy barrel you eliminate the
horizontal<00:02:11.760> recoil<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.239> only<00:02:12.599> have<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
horizontal recoil and only have to

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.290 
horizontal recoil and only have to
control<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.379> manageable<00:02:13.920> vertical<00:02:14.550> recoil<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
control a manageable vertical recoil the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.240 
control a manageable vertical recoil the
noticeable<00:02:15.690> difference<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.830> LED

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
noticeable difference is that the LED

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.860 
noticeable difference is that the LED
five<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.700> better<00:02:17.879> than<00:02:18.090> automatic<00:02:18.599> fire

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
five is better than automatic fire

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.690 
five is better than automatic fire
because<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.470> its<00:02:19.620> increased<00:02:19.980> accuracy<00:02:20.340> and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
because of its increased accuracy and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.119 
because of its increased accuracy and
also<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:21.209> better<00:02:21.420> keep<00:02:21.810> firing<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.830> LED

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
also it's better keep firing so the LED

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.070 
also it's better keep firing so the LED
five<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.519> more<00:02:23.760> versatile<00:02:24.239> than<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.599> scar<00:02:24.870> l

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
five is more versatile than the scar l
