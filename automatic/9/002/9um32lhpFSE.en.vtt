00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.060
 gt to teach you a little bit of the two 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.410
 new maps of fer 3 piazza mode and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.870
 liberation in this first mini pack voucher 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:39.900
 of maps there will be 5 I have mini contents 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.280
 new ones that are two and those five or six 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.809
 mini contents will be released in a 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.620
 only pac as it is now it is being 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.719
 normal as always was a couple of maps 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.500
 in February so let's analyze 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.730
 piazza as you can see is a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.050
 of the coastal in italy here is the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.740
 flag sees and the bomb sees in domain and not 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.039
 in demolition or in search of destroying 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:12.070
 It's all full of narrow streets 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:15.310
 going up and down here would be the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.240
 cy flag would also be a barracks 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:24.460
 general and also there would also be the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.520
 Bomb in search of destroying and demolishing 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.650
 and coming back here we see this right 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.040
 this source quote here is from another 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.040
 headquarters 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.049
 asking for here also a barracks 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.359
 general the domain flag and rebounded 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.479
 now appeared in destroy for for the 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:46.369
 putting bombs also good out there 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.700
 down also on the left also 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.590
 you can download everything and here you are 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.929
 down here the man bodeguita could not 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.800
 missing the bodeguita was born at the expense of 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.960
 Italian man 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.290
 and good here as you can see another source 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.670
 quote are very strategic points and 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.050
 there will also be a room in general 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.890
 of course I could not miss 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.800
 and well this is where I started talking 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.130
 here on the map as you can see it was noticeable 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.170
 not big enough, it has a lot 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.640
 tour one that would be your barracks 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.490
 general here in the cafeteria 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.130
 and as you can see it is although it is a map 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.170
 relatively small and it becomes very 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.420
 big because it's full all of 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.040
 passages there are a lot of defeats of 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.340
 different access for the same site 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.380
 therefore a very dynamic map is made 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.900
 already here you can find people by 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.880
 left up right up down 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.630
 everywhere I find this spectacular 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.930
 map reminds me of the favela map the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.360
 way bales very much so narrow 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.980
 which are the corridors the whole full of 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.230
 houses is awesome the truth and good 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.080
 I'm looking forward to trying this when online 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.560
 because it has a pint of being bestial 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.459
 all full of its fossils just full 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.840
 of progress and betis and that we believe good 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.180
 Awesome 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.510
 and well then nothing like this like this 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.459
 concluded this first first visit to 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.470
 the maps for which you can not 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.379
 have them either because you are of precision 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.740
 3 or xbox 360 without having the 'reality' 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.540
 premium 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.100
 so, good, goodbye , I'm all 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.100
 text until next time
