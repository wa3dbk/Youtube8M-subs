00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.520
 hello this is the channel of another daughter and 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:20.680
 today we are going to teach to make a 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:25.080
 Stuffed potato with bacon and cheese 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.080
 This is it, do not talk well 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.120
 choose 3 regular-sized potatoes at 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:03.000
 palm of my hand 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:04.880
 wash well to place in a pan and cover 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.980
 with water 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 turn the heat on and cook until 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.050
 that she looks very soft you take the test 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.220
 with toothpick only I can not 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:25.020
 be on the floor while the kitchen potato 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.880
 we're going to fry egg bacon do not need 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.460
 one's with frying oil because 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.460
 own bacon oil coast is fried it 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:41.250
 Just call and sell a kiss. 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.330
 You can also fry the bacon in the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.970
 microwaves place a dish on a sheet of 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.450
 paper towel scatters the pieces of 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.270
 bacon on top puts another sheet of 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.460
 Towel paper takes microwaves for some 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.670
 three minutes or so it'll leave 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.800
 fritinho when buying his eye goes 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.170
 frying will get healthier to happen 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.970
 microwaves why I'm not going to do 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.450
 much more and even more practical then I go 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.450
 do here 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.990
 Look, it's ready 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.800
 call and let it rest until the potato 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:32.610
 stay alive 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:38.580
 when you are almost cooked you play a 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:45.180
 only little salt to give a taste 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:49.230
 on potato ready cooked for 40 minutes 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:53.550
 and she already puts the knife she enters with 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.390
 ease in sign already good retreat is 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:04.230
 Fire potato then places a paper 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:05.490
 aluminum underneath it a piece and 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.720
 wrap her 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.720
 thus 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.240
 leaving with a little bit like this out 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.550
 make a cut in it 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:50.630
 I already took it with a little bit of 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:56.270
 margarine or butter or someday 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:04:01.090
 on the spoon I'll just pick one 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:05.540
 a little of that margarine also 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.390
 a little salt but a little bit 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.060
 because the bacon is already quite salty 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.420
 curd is also salty can stay 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.420
 too much 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.290
 Then you 'll get some bacon. 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.700
 and it goes over here in the background 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:37.120
 so over the bacon you'll put 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.120
 Creamy cheese 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:54.200
 whim curd that gives a flavor 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:57.920
 very good for potato can curd 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:10.280
 It can be catupiry tea from your 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:13.690
 criteria and then over a little 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.690
 more than 6 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:26.930
 I heard a little bit of oregano over 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:29.290
 just to give a special taste and was the 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.290
 grated cheese 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:46.550
 Just take it to the oven. 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:49.569
 the potato was in the oven about 15 minutes, 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.569
 now she's here 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.910
 so this is it I hope you have 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.530

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:27.110
