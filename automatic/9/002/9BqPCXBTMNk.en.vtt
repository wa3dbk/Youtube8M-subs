those<00:05:17.870> together<00:05:18.169> so<00:05:18.620> it<00:05:18.710> wasn't<00:05:19.039> just<00:05:19.069> all

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
those together so it wasn't just all

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
those together so it wasn't just all
over<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.699> place<00:05:20.469> there's<00:05:21.469> Daisy<00:05:22.310> after<00:05:22.819> the

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
over the place there's Daisy after the

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.139 
over the place there's Daisy after the
 underpass<00:05:24.020> again<00:05:25.009> I<00:05:25.339> don't<00:05:25.729> think<00:05:25.909> she

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:26.149 
 underpass again I don't think she

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:29.320 
 underpass again I don't think she
looks<00:05:26.300> at<00:05:26.419> all<00:05:26.539> different<00:05:27.039> but<00:05:28.149> there<00:05:29.149> they

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
looks at all different but there they

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.279 
looks at all different but there they
are<00:05:29.539> just<00:05:29.930> to<00:05:30.080> show<00:05:30.319> I<00:05:31.870> guess<00:05:32.870> I<00:05:32.960> didn't<00:05:33.199> need

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
are just to show I guess I didn't need

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.579 
are just to show I guess I didn't need
to<00:05:33.349> include<00:05:33.740> so<00:05:34.009> many<00:05:34.159> but<00:05:34.879> oh<00:05:35.149> well<00:05:35.479> there<00:05:36.409> you

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:36.589 
to include so many but oh well there you

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:43.329 
to include so many but oh well there you
go<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.990> pros

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:43.339 
go and pros

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.699 
go and pros
I<00:05:43.370> like<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:43.879> furminator<00:05:44.449> because<00:05:45.080> it's<00:05:45.349> more

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:45.709 
I like the furminator because it's more

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:48.309 
I like the furminator because it's more
comfortable<00:05:46.370> in<00:05:46.550> my<00:05:46.699> hands<00:05:47.270> it's<00:05:47.509> easier<00:05:48.169> to

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 
comfortable in my hands it's easier to

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:51.189 
comfortable in my hands it's easier to
use<00:05:48.589> you<00:05:49.459> just<00:05:49.490> you<00:05:50.330> know<00:05:50.419> I<00:05:50.449> use<00:05:50.810> it<00:05:50.959> just<00:05:51.080> like

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
use you just you know I use it just like

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.649 
use you just you know I use it just like
a<00:05:51.319> rake<00:05:51.589> so<00:05:52.249> I'm<00:05:52.639> already<00:05:52.879> used<00:05:53.180> to<00:05:53.330> that<00:05:53.479> you

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
a rake so I'm already used to that you

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.749 
a rake so I'm already used to that you
just<00:05:53.689> pull<00:05:54.020> down<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.259> length<00:05:54.409> of<00:05:54.620> dog<00:05:54.800> it

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 
just pull down the length of dog it

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.510 
just pull down the length of dog it
feels<00:05:56.120> like<00:05:56.270> better<00:05:56.449> construction<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.860> shed

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
feels like better construction the shed

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.570 
feels like better construction the shed
under<00:05:58.699> though<00:05:58.999> is<00:05:59.270> is<00:06:00.050> cheaper<00:06:00.589> than<00:06:00.800> the

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
under though is is cheaper than the

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.060 
under though is is cheaper than the
Furminator

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.120 

Conn's<00:06:08.480> the<00:06:09.480> verminator<00:06:10.080> is<00:06:10.410> more<00:06:10.770> expensive

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
Conn's the verminator is more expensive

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.850 
Conn's the verminator is more expensive
but<00:06:11.790> i<00:06:12.090> think<00:06:12.810> i<00:06:12.900> would<00:06:13.110> be<00:06:13.140> willing<00:06:13.410> to<00:06:13.560> pay

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
but i think i would be willing to pay

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.900 
but i think i would be willing to pay
for<00:06:13.890> that<00:06:14.600> the<00:06:15.600> shed<00:06:15.870> ender<00:06:16.230> I<00:06:16.530> don't<00:06:17.310> think<00:06:17.640> is

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
for that the shed ender I don't think is

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.750 
for that the shed ender I don't think is
as<00:06:18.060> easy<00:06:18.330> to<00:06:18.510> use<00:06:18.720> and<00:06:19.470> it's<00:06:20.190> mostly<00:06:20.610> because

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
as easy to use and it's mostly because

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.270 
as easy to use and it's mostly because
of<00:06:20.970> that<00:06:21.270> front<00:06:21.510> and<00:06:21.630> back<00:06:21.780> issue<00:06:22.080> you<00:06:22.920> can

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
of that front and back issue you can

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.210 
of that front and back issue you can
switch<00:06:24.030> it<00:06:24.270> around<00:06:24.440> but<00:06:25.440> then<00:06:25.620> you're<00:06:25.830> still

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
switch it around but then you're still

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.910 
switch it around but then you're still
limited<00:06:26.430> to<00:06:26.640> being<00:06:27.120> all<00:06:27.330> righty<00:06:27.930> or<00:06:28.230> all<00:06:28.440> lefty

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
limited to being all righty or all lefty

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.310 
limited to being all righty or all lefty
until<00:06:29.220> you<00:06:29.280> switch<00:06:29.460> back<00:06:29.730> and<00:06:29.970> Brian<00:06:30.900> seems<00:06:31.200> to

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
until you switch back and Brian seems to

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.470 
until you switch back and Brian seems to
think<00:06:31.470> the<00:06:31.620> construction<00:06:31.860> isn't<00:06:32.400> as<00:06:32.490> good<00:06:32.760> but

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
think the construction isn't as good but

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.890 
think the construction isn't as good but
I'm<00:06:34.110> not<00:06:34.380> sure<00:06:34.560> about<00:06:34.770> that<00:06:35.330> so<00:06:36.330> it<00:06:36.540> looks<00:06:36.690> like

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
I'm not sure about that so it looks like

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.550 
I'm not sure about that so it looks like
the<00:06:37.410> one<00:06:37.530> we<00:06:37.680> like<00:06:37.830> is<00:06:38.100> the<00:06:38.400> Furminator<00:06:38.970> and<00:06:39.560> I

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
the one we like is the Furminator and I

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.680 
the one we like is the Furminator and I
just<00:06:41.100> wanted<00:06:41.340> to<00:06:41.400> note<00:06:41.670> that<00:06:41.700> the<00:06:42.120> hair<00:06:42.420> pile

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
just wanted to note that the hair pile

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.560 
just wanted to note that the hair pile
that<00:06:43.380> the<00:06:43.530> furminator<00:06:44.010> made<00:06:44.250> was<00:06:44.520> bigger<00:06:44.760> than

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
that the furminator made was bigger than

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.990 
that the furminator made was bigger than
the<00:06:46.020> shed<00:06:46.230> ender<00:06:46.560> I<00:06:46.830> didn't<00:06:47.430> get<00:06:47.550> a<00:06:47.580> picture<00:06:47.760> of

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
the shed ender I didn't get a picture of

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000 
the shed ender I didn't get a picture of
them<00:06:48.150> right<00:06:48.180> next<00:06:48.510> to<00:06:48.660> each<00:06:48.750> other<00:06:49.170> but<00:06:49.440> I

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
them right next to each other but I

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.380 
them right next to each other but I
suppose<00:06:50.790> you<00:06:51.150> could<00:06:51.900> pause<00:06:52.080> and<00:06:52.350> go<00:06:52.440> back<00:06:52.620> but

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
suppose you could pause and go back but

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.050 
suppose you could pause and go back but
that's<00:06:54.390> what<00:06:54.990> we<00:06:55.290> like<00:06:55.560> I<00:06:55.950> like<00:06:56.460> its<00:06:56.670> ease<00:06:57.030> of

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
that's what we like I like its ease of

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.880 
that's what we like I like its ease of
use<00:06:57.450> and<00:06:57.870> it<00:06:58.200> seemed<00:06:58.440> to<00:06:58.500> do<00:06:58.620> a<00:06:58.650> better<00:06:58.800> job

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
use and it seemed to do a better job

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.170 
use and it seemed to do a better job
that's<00:06:59.880> it<00:07:00.060> for<00:07:00.270> us<00:07:00.300> thanks
