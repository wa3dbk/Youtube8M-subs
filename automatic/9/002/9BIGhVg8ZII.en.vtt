the tunnel right through the roof of the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.180 
the tunnel right through the roof of the
tunnel<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.900> look<00:02:25.320> what's<00:02:25.500> happen<00:02:25.830> it's

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
tunnel and look what's happen it's

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.960 
tunnel and look what's happen it's
plugged<00:02:26.520> up

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
plugged up

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.580 
plugged up
that's<00:02:27.150> what<00:02:27.300> moles<00:02:27.540> do<00:02:27.870> they<00:02:28.320> don't<00:02:28.500> like

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
that's what moles do they don't like

that's what moles do they don't like
holes<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.010> their<00:02:29.130> tunnels<00:02:29.490> I'm<00:02:29.760> getting

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
holes in their tunnels I'm getting

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.430 
holes in their tunnels I'm getting
excited<00:02:30.300> here<00:02:30.510> because<00:02:30.690> we<00:02:30.810> actually<00:02:30.990> found

because the way this trap sets off the
way<00:03:30.930> it's<00:03:31.020> triggered<00:03:31.440> is<00:03:31.860> when<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.160> mole

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
way it's triggered is when the mole

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.180 
way it's triggered is when the mole
comes<00:03:32.670> through<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.090> builds<00:03:33.570> up<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.740> top<00:03:35.010> of

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
comes through and builds up the top of

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.130 
comes through and builds up the top of
the<00:03:35.280> tunnel<00:03:35.490> so<00:03:35.700> we<00:03:35.760> can<00:03:35.880> get<00:03:36.000> through<00:03:36.300> this

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
the tunnel so we can get through this

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.660 
the tunnel so we can get through this
will<00:03:37.350> push<00:03:37.590> up<00:03:37.770> against<00:03:38.040> here<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.370> set<00:03:38.550> the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
will push up against here and set the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.430 
will push up against here and set the
trap<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.750> mole<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.020> going<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.230> come

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
trap so the mole is going to come

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.710 
trap so the mole is going to come
through<00:03:40.680> here<00:03:40.740> when<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:41.700> starts<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.150> rebuild

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
through here when it starts to rebuild

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.590 
through here when it starts to rebuild
the<00:03:42.840> top<00:03:43.020> of<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.290> tunnel<00:03:44.000> this<00:03:45.000> little<00:03:45.300> levers

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
the top of the tunnel this little levers

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.150 
the top of the tunnel this little levers
going<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.810> go<00:03:45.960> and<00:03:46.230> bingo

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
going to go and bingo

going to go and bingo
say<00:03:47.490> traffic<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.150> for<00:03:48.360> everybody<00:03:48.600> some
