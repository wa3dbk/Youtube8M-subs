unusual test that I put that I'm going

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.660 
unusual test that I put that I'm going
to<00:00:06.390> perform<00:00:06.540> it's<00:00:07.500> basically<00:00:07.919> going<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.370> show

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
to perform it's basically going to show

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.870 
to perform it's basically going to show
the<00:00:09.139> it's<00:00:10.139> an<00:00:10.200> iron<00:00:10.380> test<00:00:10.800> it's<00:00:11.610> these<00:00:11.700> little

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the it's an iron test it's these little

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.959 
the it's an iron test it's these little
mini<00:00:12.179> irons<00:00:12.769> that<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:14.130> supposed<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.670> heat<00:00:14.940> up

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
mini irons that is supposed to heat up

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.820 
mini irons that is supposed to heat up
extremely<00:00:15.570> fast<00:00:16.160> I'm<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.460> compare<00:00:17.820> two

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
extremely fast I'm going to compare two

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.939 
extremely fast I'm going to compare two
full-sized

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.599 

ispai<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.189> side<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.699> Rowenta<00:00:24.500> so<00:00:25.500> let<00:00:26.490> me

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
ispai that side that Rowenta so let me

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.269 
ispai that side that Rowenta so let me
go<00:00:26.730> plug<00:00:26.970> these<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.949> we'll<00:00:28.949> start<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
go plug these in and we'll start the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.020 
go plug these in and we'll start the
timer<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.090> give<00:00:30.210> me<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.359> second

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
timer so just give me a second

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.990 
timer so just give me a second
here<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.149> go<00:00:33.570> both<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.380> started<00:00:34.920> I'm<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:35.910> to

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
here we go both of started I'm going to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.580 
here we go both of started I'm going to
move<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.350> they're<00:00:38.059> sitting<00:00:42.559> face<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
move this so they're sitting face to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.779 
move this so they're sitting face to
face

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
face

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.669 
face
let's<00:00:46.390> just<00:00:46.570> make<00:00:46.750> sure<00:00:46.960> that<00:00:47.109> this<00:00:47.230> is<00:00:47.440> set<00:00:47.649> to

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
let's just make sure that this is set to

00:00:47.679 --> 00:01:00.000 
let's just make sure that this is set to
correct<00:00:57.570> sorry<00:00:58.570> for<00:00:58.780> your<00:00:58.930> chewing<00:00:59.170> that<00:00:59.710> is

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.020 

so<00:01:21.800> this<00:01:21.950> thing<00:01:22.130> is<00:01:22.220> ready<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.490> rock<00:01:22.760> and<00:01:23.000> roll

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
so this thing is ready to rock and roll

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.360 
so this thing is ready to rock and roll
after<00:01:23.360> about<00:01:23.690> a<00:01:23.750> minute<00:01:25.210> spitting<00:01:26.210> out<00:01:26.360> steam

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.980

small-sized one so in the morning it's
kinda<00:01:41.640> nice<00:01:41.760> if<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.119> need<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.299> spot<00:01:43.310> spot<00:01:44.310> iron

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
kinda nice if you need a spot spot iron

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.969 
kinda nice if you need a spot spot iron
some<00:01:44.940> areas<00:01:46.040> then<00:01:47.040> turns<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.700> soon<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:47.909> you

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
some areas then turns up as soon as you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
put in a resting position so let's go

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:03.050 
put in a resting position so let's go
check<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.130> big<00:01:53.399> guy<00:01:59.270> it's<00:02:00.270> coming<00:02:02.060> but

check on the big guy it's coming but
nothing<00:02:03.390> too<00:02:03.860> impressive<00:02:11.420> hanging<00:02:12.420> out<00:02:13.100> doing

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
nothing too impressive hanging out doing

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.990 
nothing too impressive hanging out doing
a<00:02:14.280> whole<00:02:14.430> lot<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.760> nuttin

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
a whole lot of nuttin

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.940 
a whole lot of nuttin
no<00:02:18.000> no<00:02:18.390> noise<00:02:18.630> still<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:20.150> mean<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.330> warm<00:02:21.959> but

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
no no noise still I mean it's warm but

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:37.720 
no no noise still I mean it's warm but
not<00:02:23.010> hot

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:49.000 

so

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.500 

it's<00:02:49.400> going<00:02:49.870> close<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.110> foot<00:02:52.420> from<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.540> top

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
it's going close to a foot from the top

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.000 
it's going close to a foot from the top
turns<00:02:56.510> off<00:02:56.810> let's<00:02:57.260> go<00:02:57.410> check<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.709> big<00:02:57.860> guy

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
turns off let's go check the big guy

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.760 
turns off let's go check the big guy
again

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.140 

it's<00:03:06.190> going

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.390 

there<00:03:10.750> we<00:03:10.959> go<00:03:11.319> I'd<00:03:11.440> say<00:03:11.650> that's<00:03:11.830> effective

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
there we go I'd say that's effective

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.240 
there we go I'd say that's effective
steam<00:03:13.390> amount<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.920> close<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.550> three<00:03:15.730> minutes

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
steam amount so close to three minutes

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.550 
steam amount so close to three minutes
you're<00:03:18.250> getting<00:03:18.550> a<00:03:18.640> good<00:03:18.819> steam<00:03:19.300> steady<00:03:20.200> flow

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
you're getting a good steam steady flow

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.539 
you're getting a good steam steady flow
of<00:03:20.620> steam<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.410> it's<00:03:26.560> about<00:03:26.830> three<00:03:27.310> times

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
of steam so it's about three times

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.130 
of steam so it's about three times
faster<00:03:28.030> give<00:03:28.569> or<00:03:28.720> take

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
faster give or take

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.580 
faster give or take
from<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.440> fold<00:03:29.739> to<00:03:29.860> them<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.670> mini<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.470> let<00:03:32.470> me

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
from a fold to them the mini and let me

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:43.039 
from a fold to them the mini and let me
get<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.769> close-up<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.580> this<00:03:33.640> model<00:03:42.030> sf

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
get a close-up of this model sf

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.190 
get a close-up of this model sf
seven-one-seven<00:03:44.489> steam<00:03:45.489> fast<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:46.599> check<00:03:47.110> it

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
seven-one-seven steam fast so check it

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.490 
seven-one-seven steam fast so check it
out<00:03:47.260> guys

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
out guys

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.010 
out guys
Thanks
