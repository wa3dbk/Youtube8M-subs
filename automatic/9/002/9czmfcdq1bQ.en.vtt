00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
this ball award is one of the best in

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.720 
this ball award is one of the best in
the<00:00:23.270> world<00:00:23.329> yes<00:00:23.810> okay<00:00:24.410> great<00:00:24.710> so<00:00:25.310> you<00:00:25.610> know

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
the world yes okay great so you know

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.910 
the world yes okay great so you know
before<00:00:26.240> we<00:00:26.390> design<00:00:26.750> a<00:00:26.779> sport<00:00:27.199> we<00:00:27.410> first<00:00:27.710> had<00:00:27.890> a

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
before we design a sport we first had a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.179 
before we design a sport we first had a
concept<00:00:28.369> okay<00:00:29.060> first<00:00:29.869> we<00:00:30.140> think<00:00:30.410> we<00:00:30.859> want<00:00:30.890> to

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
concept okay first we think we want to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.619 
concept okay first we think we want to
make<00:00:31.339> a<00:00:31.369> board<00:00:31.699> that<00:00:31.970> breaks<00:00:32.449> the<00:00:32.570> world

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
make a board that breaks the world

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.810 
make a board that breaks the world
record<00:00:32.960> we<00:00:33.470> want<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:34.040> build<00:00:34.250> a<00:00:34.370> board<00:00:34.610> as

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
record we want to build a board as

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.759 
record we want to build a board as
number<00:00:35.210> one<00:00:35.420> performance<00:00:35.989> on<00:00:36.140> them<00:00:36.290> in<00:00:36.620> the

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
number one performance on them in the

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.520 
number one performance on them in the
world<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.610> then<00:00:37.940> we<00:00:38.390> think<00:00:38.629> okay<00:00:39.050> what<00:00:39.079> kind<00:00:39.440> of

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
world so then we think okay what kind of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.500 
world so then we think okay what kind of
a<00:00:39.650> spec<00:00:39.890> you<00:00:40.370> know<00:00:40.489> we<00:00:40.730> should<00:00:40.970> put<00:00:41.239> on<00:00:41.360> the

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
a spec you know we should put on the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.139 
a spec you know we should put on the
spot<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:41.960> then<00:00:42.320> of<00:00:42.410> course<00:00:42.469> the<00:00:42.860> best<00:00:43.149> cpu

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
spot and then of course the best cpu

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.209 
spot and then of course the best cpu
performance<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:45.140> chipsets<00:00:45.559> off<00:00:45.739> i<00:00:45.920> will

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
performance and the chipsets off i will

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.389 
performance and the chipsets off i will
be<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.489> intel<00:00:46.789> i7<00:00:46.969> extreme<00:00:47.329> ryan<00:00:47.840> a<00:00:48.020> 64<00:00:48.440> CQ

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
golf town and of course the x58 and then

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.439 
golf town and of course the x58 and then
of<00:00:52.100> course<00:00:52.129> plus<00:00:52.699> with<00:00:52.910> a<00:00:52.940> graphics

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
of course plus with a graphics

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.900 
of course plus with a graphics
performance<00:00:53.660> we<00:00:54.140> we<00:00:54.469> add<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.859> m4<00:00:55.190> 200<00:00:55.699> chip

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
performance we we add the m4 200 chip

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.389 
performance we we add the m4 200 chip
right<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.420> two<00:00:56.600> bridges<00:00:56.840> support<00:00:57.320> 4-way<00:00:57.710> sli

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
right the two bridges support 4-way sli

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.250 
right the two bridges support 4-way sli
so<00:00:59.030> this<00:00:59.269> will<00:00:59.420> become<00:00:59.570> an<00:00:59.840> ultimate

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
so this will become an ultimate

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.860 
so this will become an ultimate
performance<00:01:00.879> platform<00:01:01.879> right<00:01:02.030> for<00:01:02.390> for<00:01:02.719> this

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
performance platform right for for this

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.900 
performance platform right for for this
kind<00:01:03.079> of<00:01:03.170> segments<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:03.980> as<00:01:04.160> you<00:01:04.580> can<00:01:04.699> see<00:01:04.879> on

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
kind of segments so as you can see on

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.400 
kind of segments so as you can see on
this<00:01:05.179> sport<00:01:05.449> its<00:01:05.630> firstly<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:07.039> adapt<00:01:07.429> for<00:01:08.410> fed

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
this sport its firstly to adapt for fed

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.130 
this sport its firstly to adapt for fed
vga<00:01:09.830> cards<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.759> needs<00:01:11.119> a<00:01:11.240> big<00:01:11.420> size<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:11.899> this<00:01:12.050> is

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
vga cards it needs a big size so this is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.559 
vga cards it needs a big size so this is
what<00:01:12.259> we<00:01:12.350> call<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.649> XL<00:01:13.070> ATX<00:01:13.550> right<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:14.240> this<00:01:14.390> is

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:14.569 
what we call the XL ATX right so this is

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:17.589 
what we call the XL ATX right so this is
a<00:01:14.750> pretty<00:01:15.170> huge<00:01:15.440> ball<00:01:15.770> right<00:01:16.069> so<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:17.420> see

00:01:17.589 --> 00:01:17.599 
a pretty huge ball right so you see

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:21.309 
a pretty huge ball right so you see

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.990 
output the maximum cpu how that's
required<00:01:44.539> when<00:01:44.929> you<00:01:44.989> overcome<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.890> cpu<00:01:46.340> so

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
required when you overcome the cpu so

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.710 
required when you overcome the cpu so
here<00:01:47.780> we<00:01:48.099> revised<00:01:49.099> the<00:01:49.130> choke<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:49.789> we<00:01:49.910> use<00:01:50.149> we

are this southern pipe that extends to

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.699 
are this southern pipe that extends to
the<00:03:19.879> outside<00:03:20.209> of<00:03:20.239> chances<00:03:20.780> once<00:03:21.349> you<00:03:21.470> make<00:03:21.680> a

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
the outside of chances once you make a

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.680 
the outside of chances once you make a
proper<00:03:22.129> airflow<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.790> can<00:03:22.970> bring<00:03:23.209> most<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.629> the

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
proper airflow you can bring most of the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.610 
proper airflow you can bring most of the
heat<00:03:23.870> out<00:03:24.069> ok<00:03:25.069> a<00:03:25.400> cool<00:03:26.000> enters<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.930> the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
heat out ok a cool enters the the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.650 
heat out ok a cool enters the the
chances<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.280> then<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.090> system<00:03:29.420> vent

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.720 
chances and then to the system vent
brings<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.170> heat<00:03:30.319> out<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.280> heat<00:03:31.519> pipe

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
brings the heat out so this heat pipe

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.879 
brings the heat out so this heat pipe
that<00:03:32.000> brings<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.720> heat<00:03:32.900> all<00:03:33.109> on<00:03:33.319> the<00:03:33.470> chipset

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
that brings the heat all on the chipset

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.430 
that brings the heat all on the chipset
mouth<00:03:34.370> spits<00:03:34.639> okay<00:03:35.329> in<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.660> VR<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:36.200> then

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
mouth spits okay in the VR and then

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.900 
mouth spits okay in the VR and then
brings<00:03:36.680> out<00:03:36.829> to<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.040> system<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:37.609> this<00:03:37.760> is<00:03:37.880> a

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
brings out to the system so this is a

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.530 
brings out to the system so this is a
quiet<00:03:38.859> thermal<00:03:39.859> solution<00:03:40.250> from<00:03:40.400> us<00:03:40.609> ok<00:03:41.480> so

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
quiet thermal solution from us ok so

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.039
