00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:37.430
 griffin on the grid is back here with the guru 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:38.930
 see what this click is in hand 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.000
 also says metronome but actually ne 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.239
 find another thing and a little affair he has 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.610
 a waving rod and tic 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.790
 tic obviously some shops of 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.820
 antiques sky still however the 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.310
 metronome serves 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.930
 to do some things 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.829
 main features of the metronome 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.270
 of the click 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.210
 in this case it is a click and a la 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.000
 the more we are of less importance and 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.740
 to keep a constant time but 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.540
 the salient feature is the thing 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.690
 principal of the metronome and which breaks i 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.790
 balls at all and is the only useless one 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.729
 say no breaks the metronome balls 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.009
 however, drummers are used especially but 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.840
 other musicians must also use it for 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.479
 that must be precise 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.460
 you must be precise, this is you 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.080
 always do very well 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.390
 sometimes it happens that only the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.340
 drummer drummer there was always tic 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.750
 tic I make him feel 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.590
 I also put the batteries, you think 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.259
 cute I have been to this mine 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.520
 song that makes him is beautiful though too 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.520
 wait for me to resign 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.270
 I put you what you like 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:02:01.090
 this is the most clicked ever 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:03.729
 your gang dance style sexy e book 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.180
 here is what you have heard so many 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.369
 times you professionals and you have to like 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.720
 they say to split metronome me 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.239
 willingly to throw away 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.650
 however, and I would split it instead 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.370
 you have to split in the sense that it should 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.450
 be precise as the metronome because 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.510
 this is important 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.820
 I don't know the producers, though, when I do 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.200
 they call you have to have this thing here 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.200
 that arbitration does not go perfectly 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.450
 because the producers understood one 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.769
 very important psychological thing when 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.100
 for example, people go to a center 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.560
 commercial and looking for stuff that can 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.880
 returning home makes it more beautiful type 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.070
 some plants 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.010
 if I see a plastic plant it says 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.680
 beautiful holes looks real if you see one 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.810
 real plant says that it looks fake 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.170
 this type of psychology is overturned 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.150
 on music one hears a drummer e 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.110
 search for flights that a good one looks like 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.449
 electronic battery 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.200
 then I hear the programmed electronic bat 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:05.440
 with the human 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.410
 ice with slightly different accents and says 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.360
 that looks like a real drummer 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.610
 here this is the psychology here yes 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.629
 takes a man to make it sound like 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.580
 a car 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.160
 this is the concept to which you are 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.040
 you are subjected to you actually not 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.670
 you would be so fanatic I know because I have 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.290
 also seen photographs with roy haynes of 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.090
 you great drummers together with roy 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.010
 haynes who is a great drummer 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.110
 a great drummer too roy 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.450
 haynes probably the metronome e 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.040
 click has never even seen why 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.739
 he does not need it sounds good to his 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.459
 also the technique you want explained a lot 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.890
 well we take roy haynes then that too 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.739
 the roy students and large a great 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.060
 big roy haynes all real is a big one 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:55.420
 but then how do you justify your hands 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.920
 that you have roy haynes because you don't have any 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:02.200
 beautiful hands roy haynes from the we are not joking 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.599
 makes us then there are things one 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.790
 little strange because there is a school there 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.700
 study accuracy and then basket roy 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.769
 haynes that makes you a bunch will go is 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.100
 curious and not justified with the 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.049
 students 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.120
 these are your problems I don't have 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.060
 problems I am a guru and I am here 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.190
 just to teach you see you 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.289
 next time on high level 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.720
 advanced and there will be a beautiful one 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.720
 surprise for musician drummers
