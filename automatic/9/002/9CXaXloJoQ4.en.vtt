shoulder personally I have a feeling my
freedom<00:01:35.170> as<00:01:35.440> much<00:01:35.800> bigger<00:01:36.160> using<00:01:36.700> my<00:01:36.940> bike

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
freedom as much bigger using my bike

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.240 
freedom as much bigger using my bike
because<00:01:37.479> I<00:01:37.750> do<00:01:37.810> not<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:38.200> any<00:01:38.410> obstacles<00:01:39.100> and

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
going

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.620 
going
from<00:01:40.080> one<00:01:40.320> place<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.920> other<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.420> city

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
from one place to the other so the city

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.340 
from one place to the other so the city
is<00:01:42.750> getting<00:01:43.170> smaller<00:01:43.380> every<00:01:44.280> one<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.820> closer

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
is getting smaller every one is closer

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.200 
is getting smaller every one is closer
so<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:46.980> of<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.160> sense<00:01:47.400> it's<00:01:47.610> tipped

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
so in this kind of a sense it's tipped

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.800 
so in this kind of a sense it's tipped
me<00:01:48.510> a<00:01:48.860> better<00:01:49.860> breathing<00:01:50.540> several<00:01:51.540> places

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
me a better breathing several places

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.260

put up to show how many bikes are
passing<00:01:56.640> each<00:01:56.850> day

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.999

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
has to be on bikes which also means to

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.960 
has to be on bikes which also means to
lower<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.290> co2<00:02:12.890> emission<00:02:13.489> with<00:02:13.700> eighty
