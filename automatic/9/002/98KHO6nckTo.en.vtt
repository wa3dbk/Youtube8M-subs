that's<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.119> has<00:00:18.300> ten<00:00:18.690> fan<00:00:19.380> ports<00:00:19.740> if<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.949> need

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
that's it has ten fan ports if you need

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.250 
that's it has ten fan ports if you need
a<00:00:20.130> lot<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.699> airflow<00:00:21.270> if<00:00:21.420> your<00:00:21.539> air<00:00:21.689> cooling<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
a lot of airflow if your air cooling and

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.439 
a lot of airflow if your air cooling and
you<00:00:22.320> got<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> big<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.460> thermal<00:00:23.880> right<00:00:24.090> air

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
you got a big like a thermal right air

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.480 
you got a big like a thermal right air
cooler<00:00:25.109> or<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.830> need<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> lot<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.310> air

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
back as well as water cooling holes you

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.380 
back as well as water cooling holes you
do<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> backplane<00:00:58.770> CPU<00:00:59.699> cut<00:00:59.969> out<00:01:00.120> which<00:01:00.270> is

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
do have a backplane CPU cut out which is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
do have a backplane CPU cut out which is
fantastic<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.260> change<00:01:01.500> your<00:01:01.949> cpu

motherboard<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.140> me<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.650> epic<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
motherboard to me that is epic it's a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.910 
motherboard to me that is epic it's a
must<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.540> cases<00:01:06.810> nowadays<00:01:07.409> now

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
must have on all cases nowadays now

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.170 
must have on all cases nowadays now
let's<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.729> some<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.030> more

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
let's get to some of the more

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
let's get to some of the more
interesting<00:01:09.510> stuff<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.680> mentioned

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
interesting stuff like I mentioned

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
interesting stuff like I mentioned
earlier<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.340> thing<00:01:11.460> has<00:01:11.549> 10<00:01:11.909> fan<00:01:12.420> ports<00:01:12.780> so

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
earlier this thing has 10 fan ports so

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.539 
earlier this thing has 10 fan ports so
you<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> big<00:01:13.710> 120<00:01:14.159> right<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
you have the big 120 right here in the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.370 
you have the big 120 right here in the
back<00:01:14.700> you've<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.030> 120<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> front<00:01:16.049> let's

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
back you've a 120 in the front let's

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.450 
back you've a 120 in the front let's
look<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> other<00:01:16.770> side<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> case<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
look at the other side of the case and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.010 
look at the other side of the case and
you<00:01:17.670> will<00:01:17.790> see<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.509> thing<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.720> actually

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you will see that this thing is actually

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.679 
you will see that this thing is actually
covered<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.799> 120<00:01:20.460> millimeter<00:01:20.820> fan<00:01:20.970> port<00:01:21.240> now

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
covered in 120 millimeter fan port now

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.390 
covered in 120 millimeter fan port now
let's<00:01:22.020> move<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.350> take<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.560> look<00:01:22.740> at<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> front

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
let's move on take a look at the front

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.280 
let's move on take a look at the front
panel<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.630> thing<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.930> actually<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
panel on this thing it's actually the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.109 
panel on this thing it's actually the
top<00:01:25.500> panel<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.009> case<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.670> really

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
top panel on this case it is really

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.910
