00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello everyone, welcome to the 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.400
 and I already have a tip 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.140
 very fast and will not be new 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.900
 for a lot of people to have a little more 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.150
 experience is with internet difference 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.540
 with the music in general thing about how 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.420
 you get scores on the internet 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.410
 En101 to download the PDF we have a 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.470
 very good tool that is iml and that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.810
 in fact it is a virtual library that 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.939
 gathers all the scores that are in 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.480
 public domain and also those in which 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.430
 own authors and composers 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.579
 they leave there to publicize their work or 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.040
 be the great part of the songs that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.899
 were written the songs that people 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 the classic flame of the scholarly repertoire 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.910
 of erudite music 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.610
 it can be found there however the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.770
 popular songs the songs whose 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.199
 copyrights are still in force 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.480
 You will not find anything there then. 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.440
 it's no use searching the music and 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.809
 be in fashion now or movie music 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.729
 Except you're not going to find it there. 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.610
 You'll actually find songs 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.920
 of public domain in several 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.850
 sections that people are sending 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.070
 own bible by this mst library is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 a non-profit organization and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.330
 It's going to be stored there. It's a wonder. 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.549
 this library has grown a lot with the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.560
 time and it is difficult for you not to 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.380
 find something there always you 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.030
 do a google search of scores 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.979
 generally the dry climate should be 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.990
 first option was similar to that 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.090
 have the personal courage generally 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.670
 research will have to be done in 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.100
 English but not too difficult if you 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.890
 want a specific song is only you do 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.950
 a search for example on YouTube of this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.659
 music that you will see you will see 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.299
 various video options that will have the 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.710
 English titles so it 's only up to you to 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.870
 English titles of the song that you 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.360
 want to make a copy 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.180
 no paste there in the google search field 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.240
 and put eg iml at the end 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.370
 So, for example if you want, do not 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.320
 Concert in G major for Muse 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.320
 violin even the score for you 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.950
 study then you put shows worth 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.720
 context and medium and e.g. 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.040
 you are everything to this is in the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.620
 youtube you will see that it goes 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.570
 have a house there and 16 which is a 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.100
 cataloging the hill if you want 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.580
 put this will also be even more 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.850
 easy 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.890
 getting down there or the page you go 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.880
 to see several sets down by 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.860
 issues 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.620
 probably you will find the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.930
 part of the score of the entire orchestra 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.020
 but if you look sideways for example 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.750
 income between the bugs by 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.180
 example there will be arrangements and 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.220
 transcriptions in the case for violin and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.500
 piano and sometimes even by others 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.390
 instruments so it's a bank 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.650
 very interesting that you should 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.260
 know everything that has dominion 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.560
 public everything that was done before 1900 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.160
 or even shortly after 1950 to 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.950
 behind you will find it easily 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.140
 It's because I see a lot of people asking. 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.940
 where do I get scores of what I 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.590
 wanted to build there you find in 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.750
 very good conditions 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.970
 without much difficulty until several versions 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.690
 to choose which ones you like 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.000
 more 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.290
 It's pretty simple to google the name 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.510
 of the composer 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.650

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.970
