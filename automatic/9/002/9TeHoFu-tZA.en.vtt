but it's when I was googling it looked
at<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.090> tutorials<00:01:12.689> star<00:01:13.350> X<00:01:13.619> looked<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

at the tutorials star X looked like the
best<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.580> me<00:01:14.670> because<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
best one for me because it was the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.109 
best one for me because it was the
easiest<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.380> was<00:01:16.470> cross-platform<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.729> PC

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
easiest and it was cross-platform so PC

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.940

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and PCs as well cross-platform so we

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.969

need to download that and then from

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.679 
need to download that and then from
there<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> computer<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.570> we'll

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
there we go to the computer and we'll

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.330 
there we go to the computer and we'll
see<00:01:39.780> what's<00:01:39.930> next<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
like this photo that's on a desktop

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.380 
like this photo that's on a desktop
right<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.460> photo<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
right now and what this photo is is a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.020 
right now and what this photo is is a
hundred<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.960> thirty<00:01:49.200> about<00:01:49.619> photos<00:01:50.520> blended

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
hundred and thirty about photos blended

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.929 
hundred and thirty about photos blended
together<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.960> program<00:01:52.350> called<00:01:52.380> star<00:01:53.009> star<00:01:53.579> X

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
together in a program called star star X

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.719 
together in a program called star star X
not<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.600> our<00:01:54.810> X<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.009> see<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.520> light

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
not just our X you can see the light

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.700 
not just our X you can see the light
trails<00:01:57.060> right<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.659> these<00:01:57.960> are<00:01:58.020> actual<00:01:58.409> stars

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
trails right here these are actual stars

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830 
trails right here these are actual stars
HMMWV<00:01:59.399> now<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.610> not<00:01:59.759> fake<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
HMMWV now is not fake so this is the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.300 
HMMWV now is not fake so this is the
kind<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.079> look<00:02:01.200> you're<00:02:01.380> looking<00:02:01.710> for<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
kind of look you're looking for is to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.399 
kind of look you're looking for is to
see<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.640> trails<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.450> stars<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.140> then

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
see the trails of the stars and then

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.490 
see the trails of the stars and then
blending<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.219> sky<00:02:05.930> this<00:02:06.930> I'll<00:02:07.229> talk<00:02:07.469> about

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
blending in the sky this I'll talk about

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.410 
blending in the sky this I'll talk about
in<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.829> second<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.280> kind<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.000> hard<00:02:09.209> thing<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
in a second was kind of a hard thing to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510 
in a second was kind of a hard thing to
deal<00:02:09.629> with<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.649> first<00:02:10.890> shoe<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.340> did<00:02:11.459> in

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
deal with the first shoe that I did in

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.980 
deal with the first shoe that I did in
the<00:02:11.610> foot

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
the foot

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.960 
the foot
this<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.500> gates<00:02:12.740> past<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.550> one<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.790> did<00:02:13.910> in

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
this is in gates past the one it did in

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.370 
this is in gates past the one it did in
the<00:02:14.030> foothills<00:02:14.420> which<00:02:14.600> is<00:02:14.720> much<00:02:14.900> easier

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
the foothills which is much easier

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.140 
the foothills which is much easier
because<00:02:15.440> there's<00:02:15.800> just<00:02:15.860> stars<00:02:16.250> but<00:02:16.820> because

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
because there's just stars but because

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.360 
because there's just stars but because
we<00:02:17.270> wanted<00:02:17.510> content<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.530> photo<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:19.280> was

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
we wanted content in this photo it was

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.640 
we wanted content in this photo it was
much<00:02:19.610> harder<00:02:19.910> because<00:02:20.360> cars<00:02:21.080> are<00:02:21.170> driving<00:02:21.350> by

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
much harder because cars are driving by

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.890 
much harder because cars are driving by
people<00:02:22.490> you<00:02:22.580> can<00:02:22.700> see<00:02:22.880> with<00:02:23.240> lights<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.780> stuff

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
people you can see with lights and stuff

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.090 
people you can see with lights and stuff
like<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.170> kept<00:02:24.470> these<00:02:24.560> because<00:02:24.770> it's<00:02:24.890> kind<00:02:25.070> of

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
like I kept these because it's kind of

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.010 
like I kept these because it's kind of
cool<00:02:25.340> looks<00:02:25.550> like<00:02:25.670> something<00:02:26.330> like<00:02:26.390> from

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
cool looks like something like from

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.440 
cool looks like something like from
space<00:02:27.350> or<00:02:27.560> aliens<00:02:28.040> but<00:02:28.550> there's<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.120> lot<00:02:29.360> of

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
space or aliens but there's a lot of

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.140 
space or aliens but there's a lot of
different<00:02:29.720> factors<00:02:29.870> into<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:31.120> see<00:02:32.120> that

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
different factors into it and see that

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.400 
different factors into it and see that
light<00:02:32.450> leak<00:02:32.660> right<00:02:32.840> there<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.290> a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
light leak right there this is a

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.050 
light leak right there this is a
shooting<00:02:33.680> star<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.070> it's<00:02:34.190> kind<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.430> cool<00:02:34.610> but

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
shooting star so it's kind of cool but

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.320 
shooting star so it's kind of cool but
I'll<00:02:35.270> show<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.480> what<00:02:36.050> we<00:02:36.230> did<00:02:36.440> first<00:02:37.240> here<00:02:38.240> are

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
I'll show you what we did first here are

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.840 
I'll show you what we did first here are
the<00:02:38.420> photos<00:02:38.600> from<00:02:38.780> gates<00:02:39.020> pass<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:40.100> shot<00:02:40.550> in<00:02:40.640> RAW

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
the photos from gates pass I shot in RAW

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.390 
the photos from gates pass I shot in RAW
so<00:02:41.150> they<00:02:41.270> were<00:02:41.330> they<00:02:42.200> were<00:02:42.260> raw<00:02:42.470> see<00:02:42.740> Artoo's<00:02:43.130> i

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
so they were they were raw see Artoo's i

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.210 
so they were they were raw see Artoo's i
had<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.610> convert<00:02:44.330> them<00:02:44.570> in<00:02:45.100> Adobe<00:02:46.100> DNG

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
had to convert them in Adobe DNG

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.950 
had to convert them in Adobe DNG
converter<00:02:46.790> because<00:02:47.000> I'm<00:02:47.090> shooting<00:02:47.240> on<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> 6d

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
converter because I'm shooting on a 6d

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.700 
converter because I'm shooting on a 6d
and<00:02:48.520> Photoshop<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:50.350> bridge<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.380> stuff<00:02:51.650> like

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
and Photoshop and bridge and stuff like

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.680 
and Photoshop and bridge and stuff like
that<00:02:51.860> they<00:02:51.980> don't<00:02:52.070> support<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.790> CR<00:02:53.030> -<00:02:53.270> yet<00:02:53.540> so

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
that they don't support the CR - yet so

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.530 
that they don't support the CR - yet so
you<00:02:53.750> have<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.900> convert<00:02:54.230> them<00:02:54.380> into<00:02:54.770> DN<00:02:55.220> G's

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
you have to convert them into DN G's

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.430 
you have to convert them into DN G's
after<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.600> did<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.930> brought<00:02:57.140> them<00:02:57.290> into

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
after I did that I brought them into

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.430 
after I did that I brought them into
Lightroom<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.750> these<00:02:59.750> are<00:02:59.870> all<00:02:59.960> the<00:02:59.990> JPEGs

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.800 
Lightroom and these are all the JPEGs
you<00:03:00.560> can<00:03:00.710> see<00:03:00.940> that's<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.180> general<00:03:02.450> photo

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
you can see that's the general photo

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.080 
you can see that's the general photo
that<00:03:02.990> I<00:03:03.050> took<00:03:03.110> right<00:03:03.470> there<00:03:03.680> these<00:03:04.640> red<00:03:04.940> ones

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
that I took right there these red ones

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.240 
that I took right there these red ones
are<00:03:05.360> marked<00:03:05.720> because<00:03:06.170> those<00:03:06.500> were<00:03:06.740> light

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
are marked because those were light

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.940 
are marked because those were light
leaks<00:03:07.490> so<00:03:07.970> here's<00:03:08.210> a<00:03:08.450> normal<00:03:08.960> one<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.350> here's

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
leaks so here's a normal one and here's

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.740 
leaks so here's a normal one and here's
something<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.370> didn't<00:03:10.670> like<00:03:10.700> like<00:03:11.300> it

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
something that I didn't like like it

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.420 
something that I didn't like like it
change<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.200> foreground<00:03:12.470> maybe<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.920> car<00:03:13.190> went

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
change the foreground maybe a car went

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.170 
change the foreground maybe a car went
by<00:03:13.580> you<00:03:14.300> can<00:03:14.450> tell<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.900> difference<00:03:15.260> because

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
by you can tell the difference because

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.610 
by you can tell the difference because
she<00:03:17.180> all<00:03:17.300> bet<00:03:17.480> red<00:03:17.690> these<00:03:18.110> were<00:03:18.260> some<00:03:18.470> of<00:03:18.560> those

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
she all bet red these were some of those

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.620 
she all bet red these were some of those
backing<00:03:18.890> ups<00:03:19.280> as<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.700> red<00:03:19.850> lights<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.600> I

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
backing ups as the red lights so I

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.470 
backing ups as the red lights so I
marked<00:03:21.380> those<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:22.040> did<00:03:22.520> a<00:03:22.550> tiny<00:03:22.910> bit<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.270> color

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
marked those I did a tiny bit of color

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.630 
marked those I did a tiny bit of color
correction<00:03:24.050> a<00:03:24.260> tiny<00:03:24.620> bit<00:03:24.800> of<00:03:24.920> exposure<00:03:25.280> and

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
correction a tiny bit of exposure and

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.870 
correction a tiny bit of exposure and
then<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.180> applied<00:03:27.040> those<00:03:28.040> settings<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.850> the

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
then I applied those settings to the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.610 
then I applied those settings to the
rest<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.360> photos<00:03:29.690> in<00:03:29.780> Lightroom<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:30.500> they

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
rest of the photos in Lightroom so they

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.680 
rest of the photos in Lightroom so they
all<00:03:30.770> look<00:03:30.980> kind<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.400> same<00:03:31.460> so<00:03:32.210> once<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.540> did

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
all look kind of the same so once I did

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.490 
all look kind of the same so once I did
that<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:33.140> opened<00:03:33.950> my<00:03:34.400> program<00:03:34.790> star<00:03:35.180> star<00:03:35.480> X<00:03:35.690> and

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
that I opened my program star star X and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.010 
that I opened my program star star X and
it's<00:03:36.620> right<00:03:36.770> there<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:38.570> if<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.840> don't

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
it's right there and you if you don't

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.470 
it's right there and you if you don't
have<00:03:39.110> Lightroom<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.560> can<00:03:39.830> do<00:03:39.980> bridge<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:41.360> can

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
have Lightroom you can do bridge you can

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.630 
have Lightroom you can do bridge you can
convert<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:41.930> or<00:03:42.110> you<00:03:42.290> can<00:03:42.440> add<00:03:42.620> settings<00:03:43.460> stuff

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
convert it or you can add settings stuff

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.730 
convert it or you can add settings stuff
like<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:43.910> Photoshop<00:03:44.600> if<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:44.900> want<00:03:45.140> it<00:03:45.590> was

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
like that Photoshop if you want it was

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.320 
like that Photoshop if you want it was
just<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:45.950> easiest<00:03:45.980> for<00:03:46.520> me<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.670> do<00:03:46.910> Lightroom

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
just the easiest for me to do Lightroom

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.030 
just the easiest for me to do Lightroom
because<00:03:47.480> I'm<00:03:47.600> used<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:48.050> so<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:48.800> is<00:03:48.890> what

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
because I'm used to that so this is what

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.430 
because I'm used to that so this is what
the<00:03:49.160> program<00:03:49.790> actually<00:03:49.970> looks<00:03:50.360> like<00:03:50.600> um

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
the program actually looks like um

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.500 
the program actually looks like um
pretty<00:03:52.280> straightforward<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.150> mean<00:03:53.270> this<00:03:53.360> is

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
pretty straightforward I mean this is

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.780 
pretty straightforward I mean this is
why<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.660> downloaded<00:03:54.140> it<00:03:54.290> because<00:03:54.470> I<00:03:54.530> have<00:03:54.790> the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
why I downloaded it because I have the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.460 
why I downloaded it because I have the
time<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.240> I<00:03:56.270> really<00:03:56.540> want<00:03:56.840> Ted<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.290> photo

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
time that I really want Ted to the photo

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.020 
time that I really want Ted to the photo
so<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:57.830> makes<00:03:58.010> it<00:03:58.130> easier<00:03:58.400> on<00:03:58.550> me<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:58.940> what

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
so this makes it easier on me so what

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.910 
so this makes it easier on me so what
you<00:03:59.090> can<00:03:59.240> do<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.660> you<00:04:00.230> can<00:04:00.320> go<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.440> your<00:04:00.620> photos

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
you can do is you can go to your photos

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.580 
you can do is you can go to your photos

in the folder and select all of your
JPEGs<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.340> just<00:04:04.490> did<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:05.150> what<00:04:05.330> I<00:04:05.360> did

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
JPEGs that you just did and what I did

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.290 
JPEGs that you just did and what I did
was<00:04:05.840> um<00:04:06.340> this<00:04:07.340> is<00:04:07.460> a<00:04:07.490> Mac<00:04:07.730> thing<00:04:07.940> but<00:04:08.060> I'm<00:04:08.150> sure

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
was um this is a Mac thing but I'm sure

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.270 
was um this is a Mac thing but I'm sure
pcs<00:04:08.660> are<00:04:08.840> some<00:04:08.990> way<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.140> do<00:04:09.320> it<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:09.860> you<00:04:09.950> can<00:04:10.100> do

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
pcs are some way to do it so you can do

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.720 
pcs are some way to do it so you can do
um<00:04:10.640> tags<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.810> can<00:04:11.930> sort<00:04:12.140> by<00:04:12.170> tags<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:12.980> see<00:04:13.490> it

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
um tags you can sort by tags and see it

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.400 
um tags you can sort by tags and see it
groups<00:04:14.120> all<00:04:14.300> the<00:04:14.420> red<00:04:14.540> ones<00:04:14.570> together<00:04:14.900> which<00:04:15.290> I

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
groups all the red ones together which I

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.650 
groups all the red ones together which I
don't<00:04:15.470> want<00:04:15.800> so<00:04:16.370> what<00:04:16.489> I<00:04:16.520> do<00:04:16.670> is<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:17.000> took<00:04:17.540> all

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
don't want so what I do is I took all

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
don't want so what I do is I took all
these<00:04:17.840> JPEGs<00:04:19.120> right<00:04:20.120> in<00:04:20.239> here<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:20.870> this<00:04:21.560> is

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
these JPEGs right in here and this is

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.620 
these JPEGs right in here and this is
what<00:04:21.830> happens<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.700> puts<00:04:23.090> them<00:04:23.180> on<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.450> left

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
what happens so puts them on the left

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.950 
what happens so puts them on the left
side<00:04:23.840> you

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
side you

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.840 
side you
click<00:04:25.169> on<00:04:25.319> or<00:04:25.530> off<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:25.949> experimented<00:04:26.610> this

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
click on or off and I experimented this

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.820 
click on or off and I experimented this
with<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.120> first<00:04:27.330> one<00:04:27.569> did<00:04:28.169> I<00:04:28.319> did<00:04:28.500> half<00:04:28.710> of

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
with the first one did I did half of

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.860 
with the first one did I did half of
them<00:04:29.009> I<00:04:29.220> did<00:04:29.370> half<00:04:29.639> of<00:04:29.729> the<00:04:29.789> half<00:04:30.030> but<00:04:30.539> I<00:04:30.600> liked

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
them I did half of the half but I liked

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.270 
them I did half of the half but I liked
using<00:04:31.050> all<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.380> them<00:04:31.620> because<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:31.949> gives<00:04:32.100> you

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
using all of them because it gives you

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.879 
using all of them because it gives you
this<00:04:32.789> kind<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.150> starch<00:04:33.449> around<00:04:33.810> look<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.229> it<00:04:34.380> so

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
this kind of starch around look to it so

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.499 
this kind of starch around look to it so
you<00:04:34.949> look<00:04:35.099> at<00:04:35.190> all<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.400> photos<00:04:35.610> they'll<00:04:36.419> be

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
you look at all the photos they'll be

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.559 
you look at all the photos they'll be
right<00:04:36.690> in<00:04:36.810> here<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:37.710> go<00:04:37.889> up<00:04:38.069> to<00:04:38.340> convert<00:04:39.090> what

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
right in here you go up to convert what

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:40.909 
right in here you go up to convert what
you<00:04:39.660> want<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.960> do<00:04:40.080> is<00:04:40.199> make<00:04:40.349> sure<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.590> sunlight

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
you want to do is make sure it sunlight

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
sure it's on lighten you don't use

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.600 
sure it's on lighten you don't use
comment<00:04:48.840> mode<00:04:48.990> you<00:04:49.770> can<00:04:49.919> subtract<00:04:50.370> dark

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
images I have that check just in case

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.960

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
but I kinda already went through those

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.089

compression for sure in general
obviously<00:05:01.349> your<00:05:01.740> language<00:05:02.130> stuff<00:05:02.340> like<00:05:02.460> that

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
obviously your language stuff like that

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.430 
obviously your language stuff like that
so<00:05:03.090> it's<00:05:03.419> as<00:05:03.660> simple<00:05:03.780> as<00:05:03.990> putting<00:05:04.110> in<00:05:04.380> the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
so it's as simple as putting in the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.920 
so it's as simple as putting in the
program<00:05:04.770> pressing<00:05:05.580> process<00:05:05.789> and<00:05:06.720> what<00:05:06.840> it's

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
program pressing process and what it's

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.300 
program pressing process and what it's
because<00:05:07.080> what<00:05:07.470> it's<00:05:07.560> going<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.740> do<00:05:07.919> is<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:08.160> can

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
because what it's going to do is you can

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.159 
because what it's going to do is you can
see<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.610> right<00:05:08.880> here<00:05:08.910> blending<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:09.870> photos

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
see it right here blending the photos

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.080 
see it right here blending the photos
together<00:05:10.349> and<00:05:10.740> for<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.310> most<00:05:11.520> part<00:05:11.669> and

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
together and for the most part and

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.339 
together and for the most part and
there's<00:05:12.300> a<00:05:12.330> little<00:05:12.570> bit<00:05:12.690> of<00:05:12.720> light<00:05:12.960> in<00:05:13.139> the

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
there's a little bit of light in the

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.350 
there's a little bit of light in the
foreground<00:05:13.680> there<00:05:13.949> that<00:05:14.099> changed<00:05:14.580> but<00:05:15.210> it's

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
foreground there that changed but it's

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.570 
foreground there that changed but it's
going<00:05:15.449> to<00:05:15.539> make<00:05:15.720> up<00:05:15.870> for<00:05:16.080> that<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.460> what<00:05:17.460> it's

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
going to make up for that and what it's

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.279 
going to make up for that and what it's
doing<00:05:17.699> is<00:05:17.909> pulling<00:05:18.150> them<00:05:18.300> together<00:05:18.930> with<00:05:19.229> a

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
doing is pulling them together with a

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.480 
doing is pulling them together with a
light<00:05:19.470> mode<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.099> now<00:05:20.669> we're<00:05:20.820> done<00:05:21.349> so<00:05:22.349> I<00:05:22.889> don't

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
light mode and now we're done so I don't

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.850 
light mode and now we're done so I don't
even<00:05:23.580> know<00:05:23.729> where<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:23.909> save<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.539> oh<00:05:24.780> I'm<00:05:25.650> sorry

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
say test I've already done this before

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.510 
say test I've already done this before
and<00:05:36.060> it'll<00:05:37.050> export<00:05:37.380> it<00:05:37.530> right<00:05:37.889> to<00:05:38.099> the<00:05:38.190> desktop

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
and it'll export it right to the desktop

and it'll export it right to the desktop
so<00:05:39.000> if<00:05:39.090> you<00:05:39.150> go<00:05:39.240> over<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.419> desktop

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
so if you go over the desktop

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.560 
so if you go over the desktop
you<00:05:40.710> just<00:05:40.949> put<00:05:41.070> 130<00:05:41.610> photos<00:05:42.000> together<00:05:42.150> and

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
you just put 130 photos together and

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.120 
you just put 130 photos together and
this<00:05:42.960> is<00:05:43.080> what<00:05:43.229> it<00:05:43.320> looks<00:05:43.469> like<00:05:43.560> kind<00:05:43.889> of<00:05:43.949> like

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
this is what it looks like kind of like

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.860 
this is what it looks like kind of like
the<00:05:44.430> desktop<00:05:44.940> you<00:05:45.150> can<00:05:45.180> see<00:05:45.330> there's<00:05:45.719> all

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
the desktop you can see there's all

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.350 
the desktop you can see there's all
these<00:05:46.020> light<00:05:46.320> um<00:05:46.590> different<00:05:47.460> color<00:05:47.789> pixels

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
these light um different color pixels

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.180 
these light um different color pixels
here<00:05:48.539> there's<00:05:48.780> a<00:05:48.840> ghosting<00:05:49.380> of<00:05:49.469> a<00:05:49.530> person<00:05:49.979> and

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
here there's a ghosting of a person and

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.040 
here there's a ghosting of a person and
that's<00:05:50.639> just<00:05:50.880> because<00:05:51.000> we<00:05:51.360> had<00:05:51.509> terrible<00:05:51.810> luck

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
that's just because we had terrible luck

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.409 
that's just because we had terrible luck
with<00:05:52.800> shooting<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.550> stuff<00:05:53.669> like<00:05:53.820> that<00:05:54.000> but

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
with shooting and stuff like that but

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.240 
with shooting and stuff like that but
what<00:05:54.539> I<00:05:54.570> did<00:05:54.780> was<00:05:54.960> you<00:05:55.050> can<00:05:55.169> see<00:05:55.409> those<00:05:55.919> dots

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
what I did was you can see those dots

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.409 
what I did was you can see those dots
aren't<00:05:56.520> there<00:05:56.789> anymore

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
aren't there anymore

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.189 
aren't there anymore
I<00:05:57.449> went<00:05:58.080> to<00:05:58.169> Photoshop<00:05:58.680> and<00:05:59.120> meticulously

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
I went to Photoshop and meticulously

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.480 
I went to Photoshop and meticulously
burn<00:06:01.199> those<00:06:01.530> and<00:06:01.770> dodge<00:06:01.860> this<00:06:02.130> stuff<00:06:02.340> like

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
burn those and dodge this stuff like

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.800 
burn those and dodge this stuff like
that<00:06:02.639> so<00:06:02.759> I<00:06:02.820> changed<00:06:03.120> the<00:06:03.180> color<00:06:03.389> so<00:06:03.659> those

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
that so I changed the color so those

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.570 
that so I changed the color so those
kind<00:06:04.050> of<00:06:04.110> went<00:06:04.229> away<00:06:04.289> and<00:06:05.250> then<00:06:05.340> I<00:06:05.370> got<00:06:05.550> that

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
kind of went away and then I got that

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.980 
kind of went away and then I got that
little<00:06:05.820> person<00:06:06.240> out<00:06:06.330> of<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.479> bottom<00:06:06.780> there<00:06:06.960> so

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
little person out of the bottom there so

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.620 
little person out of the bottom there so
but<00:06:07.710> that's<00:06:07.800> the<00:06:08.009> idea<00:06:08.370> like<00:06:08.699> it's<00:06:09.389> pretty

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
but that's the idea like it's pretty

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.999 
but that's the idea like it's pretty
simple<00:06:10.020> you<00:06:10.199> just<00:06:10.289> got<00:06:10.500> to<00:06:10.560> get<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:10.800> work<00:06:10.979> done

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
simple you just got to get the work done

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.580 
simple you just got to get the work done
30-second<00:06:11.880> exposures<00:06:12.389> get<00:06:13.349> your<00:06:13.440> f-stop

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
30-second exposures get your f-stop

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.950 
30-second exposures get your f-stop
right<00:06:14.039> your<00:06:14.250> ISO<00:06:14.729> sets<00:06:15.000> blow<00:06:15.330> anything<00:06:15.509> out<00:06:15.750> or

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
right your ISO sets blow anything out or

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.089 
right your ISO sets blow anything out or
so<00:06:16.500> it's<00:06:16.620> not<00:06:16.710> too<00:06:16.889> dark<00:06:17.250> and<00:06:17.900> to<00:06:18.900> be<00:06:19.020> honest<00:06:19.320> it

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
so it's not too dark and to be honest it

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:21.800 
so it's not too dark and to be honest it
took<00:06:20.130> an<00:06:20.430> hour<00:06:20.550> it<00:06:20.969> took<00:06:21.090> about<00:06:21.300> an<00:06:21.419> hour<00:06:21.539> and

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
took an hour it took about an hour and

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.600 
took an hour it took about an hour and
you<00:06:22.229> get<00:06:22.349> that<00:06:22.530> kind<00:06:22.710> of<00:06:22.770> that<00:06:23.370> kind<00:06:23.520> of

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
you get that kind of that kind of

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.850 
you get that kind of that kind of
quality<00:06:24.090> of<00:06:24.389> the<00:06:24.479> photo<00:06:24.719> so<00:06:25.289> I'm<00:06:25.620> sure<00:06:25.830> that

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
quality of the photo so I'm sure that

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.390 
quality of the photo so I'm sure that
once<00:06:26.370> I<00:06:26.490> do<00:06:26.550> this<00:06:26.759> more<00:06:27.800> I'll<00:06:28.800> get<00:06:28.979> used<00:06:29.159> to<00:06:29.280> it

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
once I do this more I'll get used to it

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.830 
once I do this more I'll get used to it
more<00:06:29.639> I'll<00:06:30.000> go<00:06:30.090> to<00:06:30.150> a<00:06:30.210> place<00:06:30.419> it's<00:06:30.659> better

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
more I'll go to a place it's better

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.500 
more I'll go to a place it's better
foreground<00:06:31.409> it's<00:06:31.800> easier<00:06:32.400> to<00:06:32.490> control<00:06:32.789> but

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
foreground it's easier to control but

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.820 
foreground it's easier to control but
this<00:06:33.630> was<00:06:33.810> good<00:06:33.960> this<00:06:34.080> is<00:06:34.229> like<00:06:34.349> I<00:06:34.440> said<00:06:34.620> for<00:06:34.740> an

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
this was good this is like I said for an

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.370 
this was good this is like I said for an
experiment<00:06:35.659> for<00:06:36.659> a<00:06:36.770> project<00:06:37.770> even

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
experiment for a project even

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.220 
experiment for a project even
and<00:06:38.470> it<00:06:39.190> was<00:06:39.310> very<00:06:39.490> easily<00:06:39.700> done<00:06:40.030> and<00:06:40.450> there<00:06:41.140> it

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
and it was very easily done and there it

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.520 
and it was very easily done and there it
is<00:06:41.320> so<00:06:42.300> star<00:06:43.300> star<00:06:43.510> X<00:06:43.690> is<00:06:43.840> called<00:06:43.990> is<00:06:44.380> the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
is so star star X is called is the

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.440 
is so star star X is called is the
program<00:06:44.830> that's<00:06:44.860> what<00:06:45.100> it's<00:06:45.220> called<00:06:45.370> give<00:06:46.360> it

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
program that's what it's called give it

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.760 
program that's what it's called give it
