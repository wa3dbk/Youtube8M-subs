00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.260
 I'm preparing a bit more off 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.440
 we need half a glass of vinegar 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.980

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.879

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.050
 cayenne roosters from peeled 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.470
 tomatoes a tin and small 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.470
 sliced â€‹â€‹paprika 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.640
 I run my touch samples 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.850
 mostly in the time firebox of one 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.890
 stalker here i have two bricks 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.259
 that would be down on the floor 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.149
 have a straight surface and then come 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:18.130
 on it are in the office chimney bird 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:19.540
 I burned briquettes when I normally 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.430
 what do call out to him because I need 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.030
 About six briquettes are glowing 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.630
 below 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.610
 Today I would like to roast something sharper 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.200
 then I'll put two more three 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.789
 underneath for a little more heat 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.530
 Just before I look for the lids 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.900
 but I take part in it 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.390
 away from that I say that in advance 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.810
 you do not see that so exactly then that 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.890
 on top of it, it's best to turn it around properly 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.580
 that one afterwards the sky forward 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.960
 can fold 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.500
 so we start with the oil the oil comes from 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.299
 Allow to heat briefly in the oven and 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.299
 then directly the onion afterwards 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.080
 the onions thinnest then briefly on until 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.430
 they are then slightly glassy and then 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.430
 comes the tomato- marrow suit 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.160
 this also something with something braise 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.750
 stir 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.220
 I do not show everytime I do 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.420
 stir in grams a bit 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.040
 cut together so it would look 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.380
 out after a while then comes the kulap 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.090
 meat to it and schwuppdiwupp with something 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.209
 balsamic extinguished you see you 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.180
 on your active support 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.100
 my daughter 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:48.040
 No, that's not my heart rate monitor 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:50.519
 then the carrots come to the pieces 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.519
 paprika 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:02.069
 and then the peeled tomatoes 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.730
 go also tomatoes the pieces or what 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.560
 Otherwise you have worked that way 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.269
 Just to finish, I give one more 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.440
 generous water over it 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.900
 All this would indeed afterwards really long in 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.890
 simmer the oven and then 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:24.569
 I spread the briquettes on the lid 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.970
 Here I was once generous when you 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.370
 You can watch regularly after that 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.000
 you can do that a bit too 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.590
 make you feel 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.380
 Normally I would say so come 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.079
 On top of that, I think so 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.040
 a little bit more 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.310
 yes, the whole thing looks like one 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.690
 quarter of an hour then you can do that 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.860
 quiet in between times stir the 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.209
 can not hurt so then 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.209
 also the tomatoes a bit 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.299
 liquefy 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.860
 Overall, I leave this kettle goulash 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.230
 this dish is about two to 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.769
 two and a half hours in front in the oven 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.590
 Cook 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.970
 in between times then 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.220
 up the lid again and look how 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.090
 it looks and where he sees around her 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.549
 that was pretty nice 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.959
 actually quite good yes the last one 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.549
 half an hour depending on how much 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.169
 liquid since it is still in there, you can 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.919
 then at will with open lid 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.810
 continue to cook then something evaporates 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.850
 liquid the whole reduces something 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.200
 one gets a bit creamier that's how it looks 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.200
 whole then out after two and a half hours 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.030
 too bad that no smell television yet 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.010
 that's not bad at youtube 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.740
 salt and pepper must be natural 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.240
 Also something of the cayenne pepper 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.050
 here then go straight goulash 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.280
 already to taste 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:55.540
 another daughter likes to watch 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.850
 because even the carrot is an obvious one 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.050
 would you rather meat that was it from 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.729
 I'll get another swing right now 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.510
 on my plate to match spiral 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:06.880
 noodles and totally delicious apple sauce 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:10.000
 annual yeast snack while great menu 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.889
 Great dish that would be mine 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.630
 still wants to look on my blog 08 15 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.169

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.169
