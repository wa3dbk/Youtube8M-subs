00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
first original fold I was going to use

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920 
first original fold I was going to use
the<00:01:02.550> box<00:01:02.730> time<00:01:02.910> lapse<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.149> huge<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.480> can't<00:01:03.840> go

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the box time lapse be huge just can't go

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.170 
the box time lapse be huge just can't go
around<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:05.070> gives<00:01:05.280> me<00:01:05.400> foot<00:01:05.670> rail

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
around that that gives me foot rail

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.750 
around that that gives me foot rail
about<00:01:06.420> 30<00:01:06.689> Hertz<00:01:06.990> tuning<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.520> hold<00:01:08.670> shift

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
about 30 Hertz tuning if I hold shift

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.730 
about 30 Hertz tuning if I hold shift
down<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.780> can't<00:01:10.020> action<00:01:10.380> through<00:01:10.560> while

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
down which I can't action through while

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.080 
down which I can't action through while
holding<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.189> camera<00:01:12.409> I<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:14.130> move<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
holding the camera I then move on to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.460 
holding the camera I then move on to
this<00:01:15.270> line<00:01:16.130> actually<00:01:17.130> starts<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:18.229> that<00:01:19.229> one

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
this line actually starts here that one

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.940 
this line actually starts here that one
then<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.250> up<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.450> land<00:01:21.840> which<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> thought

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
then there up and land which I thought

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.330 
then there up and land which I thought
was<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:24.170> kind<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.229> worked<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> box<00:01:26.159> it

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
was that kind of worked with the box it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.920 
was that kind of worked with the box it
was<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.490> nice<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:27.360> because<00:01:27.659> I'm<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.869> to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
was a nice with because I'm going to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.480 
was a nice with because I'm going to
have<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> chamber<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.860> was<00:01:29.130> gonna<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
have a chamber I was gonna have a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.450 
have a chamber I was gonna have a
resonance<00:01:30.450> chamber<00:01:30.930> there<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.220> lines

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
resonance chamber there and the lines

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.210 
resonance chamber there and the lines
start<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.150> which<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.409> basically<00:01:34.650> I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
start in there which is what basically I

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.510 
start in there which is what basically I
ended<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:35.939> doing<00:01:36.710> go<00:01:37.710> back<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.009> suborbit<00:01:40.520> it's

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
ended up doing go back on suborbit it's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.330 
ended up doing go back on suborbit it's
just<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> first<00:01:42.960> prototype<00:01:43.770> of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
just of this is the first prototype of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.060 
just of this is the first prototype of
what<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.890> I've<00:01:46.890> got

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
what it's going to look like I've got

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.719 
what it's going to look like I've got
the<00:01:47.240> chamber<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.130> line<00:01:50.310> starts

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the chamber and then the line starts

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.190 
the chamber and then the line starts
there<00:01:51.950> starts<00:01:52.950> off<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.130> two<00:01:53.310> inches<00:01:53.610> wide<00:01:54.200> still

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
there starts off a two inches wide still

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.130 
there starts off a two inches wide still
two<00:01:55.350> inches<00:01:55.619> goes<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.159> three<00:01:56.490> inches<00:01:56.759> here

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
two inches goes to three inches here

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.039 
two inches goes to three inches here
becomes<00:01:58.140> 4<00:01:58.409> inches<00:01:58.740> becomes<00:01:59.130> 5<00:01:59.460> inches<00:01:59.990> by<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
becomes 4 inches becomes 5 inches by the

 really but yeah that's that's a
prototype<00:02:12.450> that's<00:02:12.810> not<00:02:13.110> going<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.319> be

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
prototype that's not going to be

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.350 
prototype that's not going to be
finished<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.890> haven't<00:02:14.459> quite<00:02:14.700> worked<00:02:14.760> out<00:02:15.120> how

is quite low and I might need to bring
it<00:02:47.849> up<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.000> bit<00:02:48.650> but<00:02:49.650> until<00:02:50.489> then<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.760> a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
it up a bit but until then this is a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.479 
it up a bit but until then this is a
prototype<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.650> we're<00:02:53.040> building<00:02:53.160> something

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
prototype and we're building something

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.210 
prototype and we're building something
that<00:02:53.640> looks<00:02:53.849> similar<00:02:54.480> ish<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.410> with<00:02:56.129> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
that looks similar ish to that with the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.860 
that looks similar ish to that with the
two<00:02:56.370> eighths<00:02:56.579> in<00:02:56.790> there<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.720> would<00:02:57.810> look

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
two eighths in there that would look

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.680 
two eighths in there that would look
really<00:02:58.349> really<00:02:58.650> nice

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
really really nice

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.770 
really really nice
can<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.750> smudge<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:02.329> and<00:03:03.329> they<00:03:03.420> go<00:03:03.569> I've

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
ordered some speaker terminals as well

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.400 
ordered some speaker terminals as well
this<00:03:06.090> time<00:03:06.329> rather<00:03:06.629> than<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:06.810> shoving<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.319> in

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
this time rather than just shoving it in

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.710 
this time rather than just shoving it in
the<00:03:07.470> back<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.790> give<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.060> my<00:03:09.180> professional

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
the back so I give it my professional
