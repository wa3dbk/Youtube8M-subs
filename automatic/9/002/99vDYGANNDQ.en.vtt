allowed the offense to excel knowing the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.160 
allowed the offense to excel knowing the
defense<00:03:54.860> had<00:03:55.040> their<00:03:55.190> bag<00:03:55.660> yeah<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.810> offense

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
I don't think there's any way the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.699 
I don't think there's any way the
Huskies<00:04:14.510> lose<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.900> two<00:04:15.049> remaining<00:04:15.319> games<00:04:15.530> on

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.199 
Huskies lose the two remaining games on
their<00:04:15.830> schedule<00:04:16.010> now<00:04:16.609> they're<00:04:16.729> both<00:04:16.880> on<00:04:16.910> the

road where the Huskies have struggled

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.470 
road where the Huskies have struggled

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
but both wazoo and call

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.580 
but both wazoo and call
router<00:04:20.630> really<00:04:20.930> kind<00:04:21.140> of<00:04:21.200> seemed<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.470> have

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
router really kind of seemed to have

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.080 
router really kind of seemed to have
their<00:04:21.740> wheels<00:04:22.040> falling<00:04:22.430> off<00:04:22.700> right<00:04:22.940> now

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
their wheels falling off right now

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.210 
their wheels falling off right now
they're<00:04:23.630> not<00:04:23.810> playing<00:04:24.050> well<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.920> Huskies

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
they're not playing well and the Huskies

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.830 
they're not playing well and the Huskies
are<00:04:25.250> playing<00:04:25.610> perfectly<00:04:26.300> they're<00:04:26.510> peaking

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
are playing perfectly they're peaking

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.510 
are playing perfectly they're peaking
right<00:04:26.870> at<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.350> end<00:04:27.500> of<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.650> season<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:28.130> think

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
right at the end of the season I think

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.040 
right at the end of the season I think
the<00:04:28.610> Huskies<00:04:28.880> take<00:04:29.120> those<00:04:29.300> two<00:04:29.480> games<00:04:29.690> going

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
the Huskies take those two games going

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.260 
the Huskies take those two games going
away<00:04:30.170> giving<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:31.160> Huskies<00:04:31.550> eight<00:04:31.760> wins<00:04:32.090> on

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270
