00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
that look like there are rubber bands at

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.560 
that look like there are rubber bands at
the<00:00:34.780> root<00:00:35.019> when<00:00:35.650> there<00:00:35.830> really<00:00:36.010> aren't<00:00:36.570> so

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
the root when there really aren't so

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.590 
the root when there really aren't so
what<00:00:37.750> I<00:00:37.780> do<00:00:37.900> is<00:00:38.290> I<00:00:38.799> box<00:00:39.370> braids<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:40.120> roots<00:00:40.390> and

what I do is I box braids the roots and
twist<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.290> rest<00:00:41.500> of<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:41.799> hair<00:00:41.979> there<00:00:42.699> are<00:00:42.790> two

twist the rest of the hair there are two

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.490 
twist the rest of the hair there are two
ways<00:00:43.089> you<00:00:43.150> can<00:00:43.449> do<00:00:43.570> box<00:00:43.839> braids<00:00:44.199> you<00:00:44.350> can

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
ways you can do box braids you can

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.920 
ways you can do box braids you can
either<00:00:44.650> do<00:00:44.920> over<00:00:45.850> handed<00:00:46.710> braids<00:00:47.710> like<00:00:47.979> this

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
either do over handed braids like this

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.600

braids the shreds going over one another
what<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.339> does<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:54.879> it<00:00:54.909> gives<00:00:55.330> you<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.540> flat

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
what this does is it gives you a flat

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.640 
what this does is it gives you a flat
braid<00:00:57.489> that<00:00:57.549> lays<00:00:58.299> close<00:00:58.780> to<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.260> root<00:00:59.500> and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
braid that lays close to the root and

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.000 
braid that lays close to the root and
doesn't<00:01:00.159> have<00:01:00.339> that<00:01:00.939> much<00:01:01.180> movement<00:01:01.979> what<00:01:02.979> I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
doesn't have that much movement what I

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.910 
doesn't have that much movement what I
do<00:01:03.159> instead<00:01:03.760> is<00:01:04.119> I<00:01:04.360> do<00:01:04.420> an<00:01:04.659> underhanded<00:01:05.619> box

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
do instead is I do an underhanded box

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.770 
do instead is I do an underhanded box
braids<00:01:06.250> where<00:01:06.670> I<00:01:06.700> make<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.150> strands<00:01:07.630> go<00:01:07.810> under

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
braids where I make the strands go under

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.800 
braids where I make the strands go under
each<00:01:10.780> other<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:12.520> creates<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.539> braid<00:01:13.780> that

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
each other and this creates a braid that

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.520 
each other and this creates a braid that
is<00:01:14.530> lifted<00:01:15.159> off<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.399> the<00:01:15.729> scalp<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:17.380> have

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
is lifted off of the scalp and you have

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.319 
is lifted off of the scalp and you have
a<00:01:17.560> whole<00:01:17.859> lot<00:01:18.100> more<00:01:18.310> movement<00:01:18.789> so<00:01:18.909> if<00:01:19.000> you<00:01:19.149> have

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
a whole lot more movement so if you have

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.870 
a whole lot more movement so if you have
a<00:01:19.359> style<00:01:20.229> with<00:01:20.560> small<00:01:20.829> box<00:01:21.100> braids<00:01:21.490> where<00:01:21.729> you

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
a style with small box braids where you

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.810 
a style with small box braids where you
want<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.869> child<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.350> be<00:01:23.590> able<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:24.130> do

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
want the child to be able to do

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.910 
want the child to be able to do
different<00:01:25.270> styles<00:01:25.689> with<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:26.020> this<00:01:26.590> type<00:01:26.890> of

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
different styles with it this type of

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.319 
different styles with it this type of
grade<00:01:27.340> works<00:01:27.729> much<00:01:27.999> better<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.759> what<00:01:30.999> I<00:01:31.030> do<00:01:31.179> is

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
grade works much better so what I do is

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.340 
grade works much better so what I do is
I<00:01:31.659> breed<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.200> one<00:01:33.810> time<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:35.890> another<00:01:36.189> time

I breed it one time then another time

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.830 
I breed it one time then another time
maybe<00:01:38.350> about<00:01:38.740> half<00:01:39.039> an<00:01:39.789> inch<00:01:39.909> to<00:01:40.060> an<00:01:40.270> inch<00:01:40.359> down

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
maybe about half an inch to an inch down

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.389 
maybe about half an inch to an inch down
and<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:42.749> I'm<00:01:43.749> left<00:01:44.319> with<00:01:44.560> three<00:01:44.890> strands

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
and then I'm left with three strands

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.999 
and then I'm left with three strands
sorry<00:01:46.090> I'm<00:01:46.630> left<00:01:47.020> with<00:01:47.140> three<00:01:47.409> strands<00:01:47.890> so

sorry I'm left with three strands so
what<00:01:48.159> I<00:01:48.189> do<00:01:48.819> is<00:01:48.850> I<00:01:49.210> separate<00:01:49.780> them<00:01:49.990> into<00:01:50.200> two

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
what I do is I separate them into two

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.279 
what I do is I separate them into two
equal<00:01:51.240> strands<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:54.520> keep<00:01:55.079> bringing<00:01:56.079> all

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
equal strands and I keep bringing all

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.700 
equal strands and I keep bringing all
the<00:01:56.530> way<00:01:56.649> down<00:01:56.889> twist<00:01:57.819> now<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.600> ends<00:01:58.869> this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
the way down twist now to the ends this

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.129 
the way down twist now to the ends this
is<00:01:59.859> really<00:02:00.039> good<00:02:00.189> also<00:02:00.609> if<00:02:01.090> your<00:02:01.539> child<00:02:01.990> is

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
is really good also if your child is

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.770 
is really good also if your child is
swimming<00:02:02.619> because<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.880> braided<00:02:04.299> section

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
swimming because the braided section

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.379 
swimming because the braided section
kind<00:02:05.109> of<00:02:05.259> catches<00:02:05.709> the<00:02:05.920> shed<00:02:06.219> hair<00:02:06.819> since<00:02:07.299> we

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:07.389 
kind of catches the shed hair since we

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:10.469 
kind of catches the shed hair since we
shed<00:02:07.689> about<00:02:07.869> 100<00:02:08.350> strands<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.009> day<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:09.850> that<00:02:10.119> the

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
shed about 100 strands a day so that the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.630 
shed about 100 strands a day so that the
the<00:02:10.990> length<00:02:11.319> of<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.740> twist<00:02:12.069> doesn't<00:02:12.490> get

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
the length of the twist doesn't get

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.350 
the length of the twist doesn't get
quite<00:02:12.970> as<00:02:13.180> matted<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.380> also<00:02:14.800> good<00:02:15.100> if<00:02:15.400> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
quite as matted this is also good if you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.570 
quite as matted this is also good if you
are<00:02:16.720> not<00:02:16.960> able<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.440> get<00:02:17.620> your<00:02:17.830> twist<00:02:18.160> really

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
are not able to get your twist really

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.770 
are not able to get your twist really
tight

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
tight

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.710 
tight
at<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.860> scalp<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.459> helps<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.240> hair<00:02:22.480> stay

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
at the scalp it helps the hair stay

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.210 
at the scalp it helps the hair stay
neater<00:02:23.050> longer<00:02:23.850> now<00:02:24.850> if<00:02:25.240> your<00:02:25.510> child<00:02:25.840> has

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
neater longer now if your child has

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.220 
neater longer now if your child has
loosely<00:02:27.220> curled<00:02:27.700> hair<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.870> twist

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
loosely curled hair and the twist

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.110 
loosely curled hair and the twist
doesn't<00:02:29.620> hold<00:02:29.800> really<00:02:30.069> well<00:02:30.340> what<00:02:31.090> I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
doesn't hold really well what I

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.390 
doesn't hold really well what I
typically<00:02:31.690> do<00:02:31.990> is<00:02:32.020> I<00:02:32.290> went<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.680> here<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.160> that

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
typically do is I went to here so that

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.809 
typically do is I went to here so that
it<00:02:33.880> coils<00:02:34.840> up<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.319> then<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.130> twist<00:02:36.400> will<00:02:36.580> hold

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
it coils up and then the twist will hold

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.690 
it coils up and then the twist will hold
or<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:38.110> can<00:02:38.290> separate<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.890> ends<00:02:39.160> into<00:02:39.310> three

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
or you can separate the ends into three

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.420 
or you can separate the ends into three
strands<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.360> finish<00:02:40.900> up<00:02:41.110> your<00:02:41.470> two<00:02:42.010> strand

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
strands and finish up your two strand

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.199 
strands and finish up your two strand
twist<00:02:42.819> with<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.750> regular<00:02:44.260> three<00:02:44.530> strand<00:02:44.560> braid

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
twist with a regular three strand braid

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.880 
twist with a regular three strand braid
her<00:02:46.209> hair<00:02:46.239> holds<00:02:46.750> well<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.140> I'll<00:02:47.260> twist<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.739> to

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
her hair holds well so I'll twist it to

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.670 
her hair holds well so I'll twist it to
the<00:02:48.010> end<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:50.319> that's<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.489> there<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.180> have<00:02:52.390> it

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
the end and that's it there you have it

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.070 
the end and that's it there you have it
so<00:02:53.680> I'm<00:02:54.430> doing<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.850> better<00:02:55.030> job<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.420> editing
