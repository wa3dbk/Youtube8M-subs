00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
picked up along the way and you'll keep

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.810 
picked up along the way and you'll keep
them<00:00:13.480> in<00:00:13.599> your<00:00:13.629> toolbox<00:00:14.049> the<00:00:14.620> way<00:00:14.769> I<00:00:14.799> have<00:00:15.099> this

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
them in your toolbox the way I have this

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.880 
them in your toolbox the way I have this
is<00:00:15.999> the<00:00:16.030> first<00:00:16.150> one<00:00:16.480> here<00:00:16.750> and<00:00:16.930> if<00:00:17.560> you<00:00:17.650> want<00:00:17.800> to

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
is the first one here and if you want to

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.220 
is the first one here and if you want to
join<00:00:18.040> two<00:00:18.250> pieces<00:00:18.280> of<00:00:18.640> wood<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.240> for<00:00:20.050> some

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
join two pieces of wood and for some

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.390 
join two pieces of wood and for some
reason<00:00:20.500> or<00:00:20.620> another<00:00:20.650> you<00:00:20.890> can't<00:00:21.190> get<00:00:21.310> the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
reason or another you can't get the

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.320 
reason or another you can't get the
clamp<00:00:21.640> on<00:00:21.790> it<00:00:21.850> right<00:00:22.060> away

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
clamp on it right away

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.120 
clamp on it right away
or<00:00:22.570> you<00:00:22.960> can't<00:00:23.200> get<00:00:23.320> fasteners<00:00:23.830> right<00:00:24.010> in

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
or you can't get fasteners right in

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.370 
or you can't get fasteners right in
there<00:00:24.250> right<00:00:24.370> away<00:00:24.490> I<00:00:24.760> put<00:00:25.330> a<00:00:25.390> regular<00:00:25.780> amount

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
there right away I put a regular amount

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.200 
there right away I put a regular amount
of<00:00:26.530> wood<00:00:26.680> glue<00:00:26.860> on<00:00:27.040> there<00:00:27.250> and<00:00:27.430> then<00:00:27.850> a<00:00:27.880> couple

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
of wood glue on there and then a couple

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.240 
of wood glue on there and then a couple
little<00:00:28.450> dabs<00:00:28.750> of<00:00:28.930> hot<00:00:28.990> glue<00:00:30.180> combined<00:00:31.180> that

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
little dabs of hot glue combined that

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.340 
little dabs of hot glue combined that
push<00:00:33.250> that<00:00:33.430> together<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:34.060> then<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.900> hot<00:00:35.080> glue

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
push that together and then the hot glue

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.470 
push that together and then the hot glue
keeps<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.190> joint<00:00:36.430> closed<00:00:36.700> while<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.210> wood

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
keeps the joint closed while the wood

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.630 
keeps the joint closed while the wood
glue<00:00:37.660> dries<00:00:37.990> and<00:00:38.350> again<00:00:39.010> later<00:00:39.160> on<00:00:39.400> you<00:00:39.550> could

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
glue dries and again later on you could

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.400 
glue dries and again later on you could
put<00:00:39.820> screws<00:00:40.060> in<00:00:40.240> here<00:00:40.480> or<00:00:40.660> you<00:00:40.990> can<00:00:41.110> clamp<00:00:41.320> it

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
put screws in here or you can clamp it

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.780 
put screws in here or you can clamp it
together<00:00:41.560> but<00:00:41.950> this<00:00:42.190> gives<00:00:42.400> you<00:00:42.490> the<00:00:42.610> ability

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
together but this gives you the ability

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.690 
together but this gives you the ability
to<00:00:43.000> move<00:00:43.210> on<00:00:43.360> to<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.630> next<00:00:43.720> phase<00:00:43.930> of<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.230> job

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.920 

here's<00:00:48.700> into<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.000> hot<00:00:49.120> glue<00:00:49.329> tip<00:00:49.540> if<00:00:49.720> you<00:00:49.810> have

a hot glue gun but you have the stick
you<00:00:56.260> could<00:00:56.380> just<00:00:56.530> use<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:56.980> lighter<00:00:59.430> to<00:01:00.430> heat<00:01:00.460> up

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
you could just use a lighter to heat up

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.410 
you could just use a lighter to heat up
the<00:01:00.880> end<00:01:01.000> of<00:01:01.149> the<00:01:01.210> hot<00:01:01.360> glue<00:01:01.600> stick<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:04.239> you

examples of hot glue joints and you want

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.069 
examples of hot glue joints and you want
to<00:01:36.520> break<00:01:36.969> them<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.479> could<00:01:37.630> try<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:37.929> break

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
to break them you could try and break

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.359 
to break them you could try and break
them<00:01:38.259> but<00:01:38.380> sometimes<00:01:38.709> it<00:01:38.829> might<00:01:38.920> pull<00:01:39.130> some<00:01:39.340> of

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
them but sometimes it might pull some of

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.849 
them but sometimes it might pull some of
the<00:01:39.490> fibers<00:01:39.789> around<00:01:39.969> it<00:01:40.119> if<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:41.200> want<00:01:41.469> get<00:01:41.829> a

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
the fibers around it if you want get a

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:43.620 
the fibers around it if you want get a
can<00:01:42.100> of<00:01:42.249> computer<00:01:42.670> duster<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.479> could

can of computer duster and you could
freeze<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.200> joint<00:01:44.529> and<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:47.020> tends<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.349> break

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
freeze that joint and it tends to break

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.449 
freeze that joint and it tends to break
a<00:01:47.619> little<00:01:47.859> bit<00:01:47.979> easier<00:01:48.569> you<00:01:49.569> can<00:01:49.719> see<00:01:49.869> here

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
a little bit easier you can see here

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:55.260 
a little bit easier you can see here
freeze<00:01:51.459> that<00:01:51.670> from<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:51.909> inside<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:55.119> it

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
freeze that from the inside and it

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.209 
freeze that from the inside and it
cracks<00:01:55.509> right<00:01:55.719> off<00:01:55.899> here's<00:01:56.560> an<00:01:56.679> example<00:01:56.919> of<00:01:57.130> a

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
cracks right off here's an example of a

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:58.529 
cracks right off here's an example of a
soft<00:01:57.429> talked<00:01:57.609> loose<00:01:57.849> thick<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.209> if<00:01:58.270> we<00:01:58.359> freeze

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
soft talked loose thick and if we freeze

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.530 
soft talked loose thick and if we freeze
it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.039 
it
it<00:02:01.409> should<00:02:01.619> snap<00:02:01.939> just<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.840> that's

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it should snap just like that so that's

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.160 
it should snap just like that so that's
sort<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.439> what<00:02:04.590> happens<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.100> joint<00:02:06.170> this

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
sort of what happens to the joint this

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.630 
sort of what happens to the joint this
also<00:02:07.470> works<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.740> some<00:02:07.920> other<00:02:08.069> types<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.459> glues

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
down and of course you got to be careful

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.550 
down and of course you got to be careful
you<00:02:27.300> don't<00:02:27.420> burn<00:02:27.690> your<00:02:27.870> skin<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:29.060> using<00:02:30.060> this

freon to get something cold it works

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.180 
freon to get something cold it works
really<00:02:33.600> good<00:02:33.720> also<00:02:34.140> when<00:02:34.739> you're<00:02:34.890> trying<00:02:35.100> to

until<00:03:35.790> I'm<00:03:36.540> able<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.930> get<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.200> screws<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.620> from

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
until I'm able to get the screws in from

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.380 
until I'm able to get the screws in from
behind<00:03:37.920> or<00:03:38.370> place<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.850> holes<00:03:39.060> for<00:03:39.329> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
behind or place the holes for the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.390 
behind or place the holes for the
handles<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.230> here's<00:03:40.650> an<00:03:40.799> example<00:03:40.890> I've

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
handles so here's an example I've

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.979 
handles so here's an example I've
already<00:03:41.489> glued<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.180> one<00:03:42.390> in<00:03:42.480> place<00:03:42.660> with<00:03:42.870> hot

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
already glued this one in place with hot

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.650 
already glued this one in place with hot
glue<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.160> just<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.519> shop<00:03:44.970> cabinet<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:45.540> it's

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
glue this is just a shop cabinet so it's

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.319 
glue this is just a shop cabinet so it's
not<00:03:45.810> quite<00:03:46.019> accurate<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.620> just<00:03:46.799> eggs<00:03:47.130> but<00:03:48.120> just

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
not quite accurate it just eggs but just

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.569 
not quite accurate it just eggs but just
to<00:03:48.420> show<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.690> example<00:03:49.140> of<00:03:49.230> what<00:03:49.319> I<00:03:49.350> do<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:50.370> this

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
to show the example of what I do if this

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.470 
to show the example of what I do if this
is<00:03:50.760> my<00:03:50.880> clean<00:03:51.120> perfect<00:03:51.390> draw<00:03:51.720> face<00:03:53.480> spaced

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
is my clean perfect draw face spaced

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.309 
is my clean perfect draw face spaced
them<00:03:54.810> apart

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
them apart

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.379 
them apart
sometimes<00:03:56.160> with<00:03:56.370> shims<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:56.880> this<00:03:57.000> case<00:03:57.209> these

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
sometimes with shims in this case these

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.520 
sometimes with shims in this case these
are<00:03:57.450> really<00:03:57.750> wide<00:03:57.959> shims

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
are really wide shims

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.440 
are really wide shims
but<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.250> just<00:03:59.430> make<00:03:59.609> sure<00:03:59.730> that<00:03:59.880> I<00:03:59.910> got<00:04:00.090> enough

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
but I just make sure that I got enough

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.740 
but I just make sure that I got enough
area<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:01.109> get<00:04:01.200> an<00:04:01.319> even<00:04:01.470> spacing<00:04:01.829> around<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:03.690> I

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
area to get an even spacing around and I

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.170 
area to get an even spacing around and I
put<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.639> dab<00:04:05.639> of<00:04:05.790> hot<00:04:05.910> glue

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.840 

gently<00:04:09.410> until<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.470> get<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.890> airspace<00:04:11.460> I<00:04:11.640> want

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
gently until I get the airspace I want

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.820 
gently until I get the airspace I want
around<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.480> then<00:04:12.960> I<00:04:12.990> gently<00:04:13.230> push<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.590> into

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
around it and then I gently push it into

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.880 
around it and then I gently push it into
place<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.400> then<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.900> strength<00:04:16.230> is<00:04:16.440> provided

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
place and then the strength is provided

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.380 
place and then the strength is provided
from<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.130> screws<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.550> will<00:04:17.670> ultimately<00:04:18.060> put<00:04:18.270> in

from the screws I will ultimately put in
from<00:04:18.570> inside<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.410> then<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.709> handle<00:04:20.130> with<00:04:20.489> the

that glue joint you push it in or out so

that glue joint you push it in or out so
that's<00:04:34.170> all<00:04:34.470> done<00:04:34.770> but<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.070> most<00:04:35.220> important

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
that's all done but the most important

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.950 
that's all done but the most important
placement<00:04:36.060> is<00:04:36.120> just<00:04:36.330> this<00:04:36.420> placement<00:04:36.690> inside

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
placement is just this placement inside

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.540 
placement is just this placement inside
of<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.350> frame<00:04:37.640> and<00:04:38.640> so<00:04:38.880> here<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.210> just<00:04:39.360> see<00:04:40.550> in

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
of the frame and so here you just see in

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.050 
of the frame and so here you just see in
people<00:04:42.000> that<00:04:42.770> again<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.950> would<00:04:44.280> ultimately<00:04:44.490> put

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
people that again I would ultimately put

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.940 
people that again I would ultimately put
handles<00:04:45.390> on<00:04:45.540> these<00:04:45.750> but<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.410> is<00:04:46.470> just<00:04:46.740> some

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
handles on these but this is just some

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.850 
handles on these but this is just some
