just<00:02:16.640> give<00:02:16.820> it<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:16.970> shake<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:20.560> we<00:02:21.560> will<00:02:21.710> combine

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
just give it a shake and we will combine

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.850 
just give it a shake and we will combine
this<00:02:23.330> also

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.630 

now<00:02:26.400> when<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.700> do<00:02:26.910> start<00:02:27.210> seeing<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:29.250> it's

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
now when you do start seeing that it's

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.640 
now when you do start seeing that it's
getting<00:02:29.880> really<00:02:30.270> really<00:02:30.630> dry<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.290> start

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
getting really really dry you can start

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.340 
getting really really dry you can start
adding<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> little<00:02:32.460> bit<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.760> milk<00:02:36.320> so<00:02:37.320> I

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
adding in a little bit of that milk so I

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.880 
adding in a little bit of that milk so I
can<00:02:37.590> hear<00:02:37.860> my<00:02:38.010> mixer<00:02:39.050> starting<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.770> know

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
can hear my mixer starting to you know

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.950 
can hear my mixer starting to you know
work<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.400> little<00:02:41.550> bit<00:02:41.730> harder<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.780> grab<00:02:42.930> a

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
work a little bit harder so I can grab a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.360 
work a little bit harder so I can grab a
little<00:02:43.290> bit<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.950> I'll<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:44.160> get<00:02:44.340> a

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
little bit of this and I'll just get a

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.520 
little bit of this and I'll just get a
little<00:02:44.400> bit<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:48.260> then<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.290> will

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
little bit of that in then that will

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.010 
little bit of that in then that will
introduce<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:50.100> lot<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.400> moisture<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.030> and

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
introduce a lot of moisture to this and

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.450 
introduce a lot of moisture to this and
it<00:02:52.110> will<00:02:52.200> make<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.770> lot<00:02:53.280> easier<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.730> mix<00:02:58.460> all

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
it will make it a lot easier to mix all

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.230 
it will make it a lot easier to mix all
right<00:02:59.520> and<00:02:59.820> now<00:03:00.180> we'll<00:03:00.390> add<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.830> another<00:03:01.830> cup

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
right and now we'll add in another cup

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.870 
right and now we'll add in another cup
of<00:03:03.240> icing<00:03:03.420> sugar<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:06.930> there<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:08.610> give<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.790> a

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
of icing sugar in there and give it a

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:21.220 
of icing sugar in there and give it a
shake<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:14.100> then<00:03:14.190> let's<00:03:14.430> mix<00:03:14.640> this

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.920 

so<00:03:21.830> since<00:03:22.069> this<00:03:22.250> recipe<00:03:22.819> is<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.840> know

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
so since this recipe is you know

frosting I'm not going to skip any of
the<00:03:29.330> steps<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:30.099> know<00:03:31.099> if<00:03:31.160> we<00:03:31.250> were<00:03:31.370> doing

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
the steps you know if we were doing

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.250 
the steps you know if we were doing
something<00:03:31.879> else<00:03:32.120> in<00:03:32.300> this<00:03:32.390> recipe<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:32.900> would

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
something else in this recipe I would

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.740 
something else in this recipe I would
you<00:03:33.950> know<00:03:33.980> just<00:03:34.069> say<00:03:34.760> just<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.209> know<00:03:35.300> continue

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
you know just say just you know continue

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.600 
you know just say just you know continue
to<00:03:35.870> do<00:03:36.019> this<00:03:36.170> until<00:03:36.230> all<00:03:36.800> of<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.010> ingredients

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
to do this until all of the ingredients

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.259 
to do this until all of the ingredients
are<00:03:37.760> mixed<00:03:37.819> in<00:03:38.300> but<00:03:38.510> since<00:03:39.230> this<00:03:39.380> is<00:03:39.440> only<00:03:40.269> for

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
are mixed in but since this is only for

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.080 
are mixed in but since this is only for
this<00:03:41.390> recipe<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.380> will<00:03:43.130> show<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:44.000> entire

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
this recipe I will show you the entire

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.890 
this recipe I will show you the entire
you<00:03:45.050> know<00:03:45.080> process<00:03:47.799> that's<00:03:48.799> good<00:03:49.099> and<00:03:49.900> then

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
you know process that's good and then

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.160 
you know process that's good and then
we'll<00:03:51.890> add<00:03:52.069> in<00:03:52.099> some<00:03:52.970> more<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.269> our<00:03:53.360> icing

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
we'll add in some more of our icing

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:03.280 
we'll add in some more of our icing
sugar<00:04:00.519> and<00:04:01.519> that's<00:04:01.819> our<00:04:02.120> last<00:04:02.329> addition<00:04:02.930> of

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
sugar and that's our last addition of

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.110 
sugar and that's our last addition of
icing<00:04:03.650> sugar<00:04:03.829> so<00:04:04.099> I'll<00:04:04.190> just<00:04:04.310> get<00:04:04.489> all<00:04:04.670> this<00:04:04.910> in

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
icing sugar so I'll just get all this in

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.339 
icing sugar so I'll just get all this in
at<00:04:05.840> this<00:04:05.989> point<00:04:07.390> so<00:04:08.390> I<00:04:08.420> did<00:04:08.690> measure<00:04:08.959> this<00:04:09.170> out

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
at this point so I did measure this out

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.410 
at this point so I did measure this out
and<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:09.650> exactly<00:04:09.980> four<00:04:10.819> cups<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:14.209> goes

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
and it's exactly four cups that goes

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.080 
and it's exactly four cups that goes
into<00:04:14.599> this<00:04:14.780> recipe<00:04:15.190> I'm<00:04:16.190> just<00:04:16.370> gonna<00:04:16.519> push<00:04:16.790> the

into this recipe I'm just gonna push the

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.390 
into this recipe I'm just gonna push the
remainder<00:04:17.630> with<00:04:17.870> my<00:04:18.019> fingers<00:04:18.410> through<00:04:19.280> our

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
remainder with my fingers through our

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.240 
remainder with my fingers through our
sieve<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:20.000> that's<00:04:20.269> it<00:04:20.510> for<00:04:21.350> our<00:04:21.380> icing<00:04:22.070> sugar

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
sieve and that's it for our icing sugar

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.490 
sieve and that's it for our icing sugar
also<00:04:22.760> known<00:04:22.940> as<00:04:23.150> confectioners<00:04:24.050> sugar<00:04:24.080> or
