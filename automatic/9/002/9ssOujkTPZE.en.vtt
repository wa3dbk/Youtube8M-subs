00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
same time just for the sake of argument

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.760 
same time just for the sake of argument
let's<00:02:15.510> say<00:02:16.510> there's<00:02:16.840> an<00:02:16.959> explosion<00:02:17.650> of

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
let's say there's an explosion of

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.000 
let's say there's an explosion of
Thanksgiving<00:02:18.430> dinner<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:22.290> these<00:02:23.290> four<00:02:23.709> died

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
Thanksgiving dinner and these four died

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.760 
Thanksgiving dinner and these four died
but<00:02:24.340> their<00:02:24.580> children<00:02:25.090> survive<00:02:25.600> because<00:02:26.410> they

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
but their children survive because they

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.940 
but their children survive because they
were<00:02:26.830> seated<00:02:27.190> at<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:28.120> children's<00:02:28.600> table<00:02:30.930> so

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.709 

so<00:02:34.950> now<00:02:35.249> according<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> theory<00:02:36.420> these

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
so now according to the theory these

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.449 
so now according to the theory these
four<00:02:37.109> go<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.319> heaven<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.739> they<00:02:37.829> start<00:02:38.129> helping
