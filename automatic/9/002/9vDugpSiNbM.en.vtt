the phone but at the same time it also

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.740 
the phone but at the same time it also
adds<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.160> sort<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:18.940> thought<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.210> you<00:02:19.570> have

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
adds this sort of thought that you have

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.480 
adds this sort of thought that you have
a<00:02:19.780> pretty<00:02:20.050> sturdy<00:02:20.290> phone<00:02:20.560> all<00:02:20.830> around<00:02:21.190> and

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
a pretty sturdy phone all around and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.850 
a pretty sturdy phone all around and
that<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.570> frame<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.110> separates<00:02:23.680> not

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
that is the frame that separates not

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.320 
that is the frame that separates not
only<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.190> design<00:02:24.490> of<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.940> front<00:02:25.120> but<00:02:25.300> also

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
only the design of the front but also

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.180 
only the design of the front but also
the<00:02:25.600> design<00:02:26.050> on<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.410> back<00:02:26.440> which<00:02:26.770> i<00:02:26.890> think<00:02:27.100> is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
the design on the back which i think is

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.610 
the design on the back which i think is
a<00:02:27.220> brilliant<00:02:27.670> move<00:02:27.820> because<00:02:28.540> well<00:02:29.230> with<00:02:29.500> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
a brilliant move because well with the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.380 
a brilliant move because well with the
previous<00:02:30.100> Moto<00:02:30.340> X<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.760> would<00:02:30.820> have<00:02:31.000> wanted<00:02:31.240> a

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
previous Moto X I would have wanted a

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.110 
previous Moto X I would have wanted a
white<00:02:31.690> front<00:02:32.140> with<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.620> bamboo<00:02:33.010> back<00:02:33.280> because

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
white front with the bamboo back because

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.880 
white front with the bamboo back because
to<00:02:34.270> me<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.420> is<00:02:34.630> pretty<00:02:35.260> much<00:02:35.440> what<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
to me that is pretty much what the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.650 
to me that is pretty much what the
better<00:02:36.220> looking<00:02:36.400> combination<00:02:37.209> was<00:02:37.360> but<00:02:37.570> when

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
better looking combination was but when

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.210 
better looking combination was but when
I<00:02:37.690> looked<00:02:37.959> at<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.320> on<00:02:38.560> Moto<00:02:38.770> maker<00:02:38.860> I

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
I looked at this on Moto maker I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.620 
I looked at this on Moto maker I
realized<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.760> metal<00:02:40.000> frame<00:02:40.209> really<00:02:40.390> does

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
realized that metal frame really does

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.470 
realized that metal frame really does
separate<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.740> two<00:02:42.040> elements<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:42.970> thus

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
separate the two elements and thus

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.000 
separate the two elements and thus
you're<00:02:43.750> able<00:02:43.990> to<00:02:44.020> have<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.530> best<00:02:44.680> of<00:02:44.860> both

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
you're able to have the best of both

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.500 
you're able to have the best of both
worlds<00:02:45.520> like<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:46.060> said<00:02:46.209> already

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
worlds like I said already

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.150 
worlds like I said already
these<00:02:46.750> are<00:02:46.870> Android<00:02:47.260> thority<00:02:47.530> colors<00:02:47.800> up<00:02:47.980> on

on the back now on the back I will admit

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.220 
on the back now on the back I will admit

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
logo I'm not too sure about that it does

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.600 
logo I'm not too sure about that it does
sort<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:58.990> clash<00:02:59.380> with<00:02:59.709> what<00:02:59.739> is<00:03:00.010> around<00:03:00.310> this

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
sort of clash with what is around this

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.120 
sort of clash with what is around this
particular<00:03:00.790> area<00:03:01.209> but<00:03:01.450> it's<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.630> very<00:03:01.870> small

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.090 
kind of caves in a little bit and yes it
might<00:03:16.930> clash<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.260> little<00:03:17.530> bit<00:03:17.739> with<00:03:17.830> what<00:03:17.980> is

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
might clash a little bit with what is

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.890 
might clash a little bit with what is
otherwise<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.430> very<00:03:18.550> clean<00:03:19.000> back<00:03:19.330> but

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
otherwise a very clean back but

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.479 
otherwise a very clean back but
nonetheless<00:03:20.080> this<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.920> configuration

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
nonetheless this is the configuration

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.160 
nonetheless this is the configuration
that<00:03:21.580> I<00:03:21.640> wanted<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.630> only<00:03:22.810> thing<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.140> I

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
that I wanted the only thing that I

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.600 
that I wanted the only thing that I
really<00:03:23.590> feel<00:03:23.769> like<00:03:23.830> when<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.250> comes<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.519> the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
really feel like when it comes to the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.910 
really feel like when it comes to the
ergonomics<00:03:25.209> is<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.750> fact<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.050> because<00:03:26.290> the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
ergonomics is the fact that because the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.250 
ergonomics is the fact that because the
sides<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:28.300> have<00:03:28.450> that<00:03:28.600> curve<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.080> back

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
sides you have that curve on the back

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.690 
sides you have that curve on the back
that<00:03:29.440> allows<00:03:29.530> it<00:03:29.800> to<00:03:29.830> sit<00:03:30.040> very<00:03:30.250> nicely<00:03:30.459> in

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
that allows it to sit very nicely in

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.090 
that allows it to sit very nicely in
your<00:03:30.730> hand<00:03:30.850> but<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.630> curves<00:03:31.989> or<00:03:32.410> rather<00:03:32.830> thus

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
your hand but the curves or rather thus

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.280 
your hand but the curves or rather thus
the<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.400> flatness<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.360> sides<00:03:34.660> due<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.170> the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
the the flatness of the sides due to the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.900 
the the flatness of the sides due to the
metal<00:03:35.560> construction<00:03:36.130> might<00:03:36.550> make<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.850> a

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
metal construction might make it a

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.750 
metal construction might make it a
little<00:03:36.940> bit<00:03:37.390> tougher<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.080> sort<00:03:38.650> of<00:03:38.739> pinch<00:03:39.100> when

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
little bit tougher to sort of pinch when

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.810 
little bit tougher to sort of pinch when
it<00:03:39.880> comes<00:03:40.090> to<00:03:40.450> utilizing<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.500> phone<00:03:41.739> I<00:03:41.980> have

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
it comes to utilizing this phone I have

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.910 
it comes to utilizing this phone I have
had<00:03:43.120> an<00:03:43.269> instance<00:03:43.600> already<00:03:43.959> where<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.709> almost

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
had an instance already where it almost

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.050 
had an instance already where it almost
slipped<00:03:45.310> out<00:03:45.430> of<00:03:45.459> my<00:03:45.580> hand

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
slipped out of my hand

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.580 
slipped out of my hand
solely<00:03:46.420> because<00:03:46.840> there's<00:03:47.049> very<00:03:47.230> little<00:03:47.380> real

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
solely because there's very little real

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.289 
solely because there's very little real
estate<00:03:47.680> on<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.220> sides<00:03:48.459> in<00:03:48.730> order<00:03:48.790> for<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:49.150> to

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
estate on the sides in order for you to

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:50.970 
estate on the sides in order for you to
really<00:03:49.450> pinch<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:49.989> hold<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.350> phone<00:03:50.560> that's

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
really pinch and hold the phone that's

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.530 
really pinch and hold the phone that's
the<00:03:51.100> only<00:03:51.310> grab<00:03:51.489> that<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.730> have<00:03:51.970> it's<00:03:52.180> not<00:03:52.209> even

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
the only grab that I have it's not even

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.670 
the only grab that I have it's not even
really<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.780> grab<00:03:52.989> it's<00:03:53.170> just<00:03:53.320> something<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.560> I

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
really a grab it's just something that I

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.050 
really a grab it's just something that I
noticed<00:03:53.890> when<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:54.160> came<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.580> ergonomics<00:03:55.000> of

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
noticed when I came to the ergonomics of

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.210 
noticed when I came to the ergonomics of
this<00:03:55.209> one<00:03:55.360> but<00:03:55.510> otherwise<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:56.019> is<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.170> very<00:03:56.470> nice

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
this one but otherwise it is a very nice

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.340

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
around especially when you make it look

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.880 
around especially when you make it look

is that if we look at the two sides
right<00:05:00.060> here<00:05:00.120> when<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.540> comes<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.700> metal

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
right here when it comes to the metal

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.700 
right here when it comes to the metal
frame<00:05:03.060> that<00:05:03.420> it<00:05:03.750> is<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:03.900> little<00:05:04.200> bit<00:05:04.320> darker

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
frame that it is a little bit darker

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.620 
frame that it is a little bit darker
because<00:05:05.160> as<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.610> blend<00:05:05.820> in<00:05:05.970> with<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.330> front

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
because as to blend in with the front

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.930 
because as to blend in with the front
that<00:05:06.840> is<00:05:06.990> black<00:05:07.380> and<00:05:07.830> that's<00:05:08.070> fine<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:08.910> makes

that is black and that's fine it makes

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.060 
that is black and that's fine it makes
quite<00:05:09.450> a<00:05:09.540> bit<00:05:09.720> of<00:05:09.810> sense<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.290> personally<00:05:10.890> would

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
quite a bit of sense I personally would

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.590 
quite a bit of sense I personally would
have<00:05:11.100> preferred<00:05:11.610> this<00:05:11.760> lighter<00:05:12.060> shade<00:05:12.390> of

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
have preferred this lighter shade of

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.690 
have preferred this lighter shade of
bamboo<00:05:12.960> on<00:05:13.110> there<00:05:13.290> but<00:05:13.530> from<00:05:14.130> what<00:05:14.280> I<00:05:14.310> can<00:05:14.430> tell

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
bamboo on there but from what I can tell
