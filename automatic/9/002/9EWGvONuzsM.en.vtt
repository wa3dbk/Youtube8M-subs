now<00:00:05.370> you're<00:00:05.580> getting<00:00:05.819> training<00:00:06.120> on<00:00:06.450> their

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
now you're getting training on their

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.770 
now you're getting training on their
different<00:00:07.560> gold<00:00:07.740> machines<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.790> we've<00:00:09.480> gotten

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
different gold machines and we've gotten

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.789 
different gold machines and we've gotten
a<00:00:09.840> target<00:00:11.450> here<00:00:12.450> behind<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:13.019> bush<00:00:13.320> we've

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
a target here behind this bush we've

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.460 
a target here behind this bush we've
moved<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.160> little<00:00:14.309> bit<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:15.020> overburden<00:00:16.020> off<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
moved a little bit of overburden off the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.550 
moved a little bit of overburden off the
top<00:00:16.850> usually<00:00:17.850> when<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.449> remove<00:00:18.779> overburden

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
top usually when you remove overburden

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.779 
top usually when you remove overburden
if<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.800> target<00:00:20.250> moves<00:00:20.279> its<00:00:21.270> surface<00:00:21.779> trash

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
if the target moves its surface trash

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.490 
if the target moves its surface trash
normally<00:00:23.789> not<00:00:23.970> gold<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:25.019> remove<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
normally not gold you remove the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.380 
normally not gold you remove the
overburden<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.490> still<00:00:26.580> there<00:00:27.000> or

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
overburden and if it's still there or

the good guys we dig those okay they
fool<00:00:56.430> us

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
fool us

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.279

all this beautiful quartz laying out
here<00:01:04.460> these<00:01:05.460> big<00:01:05.909> flat<00:01:06.210> rocks<00:01:06.600> hopefully

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
here these big flat rocks hopefully

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.179 
here these big flat rocks hopefully
that's<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.520> piece<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> gold<00:01:09.650> okay<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.710> come<00:01:11.040> off

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that's a piece of gold okay so come off

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.370 
that's a piece of gold okay so come off
to<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> side<00:01:11.729> or<00:01:12.659> where<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
to the side or where you think the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.960 
to the side or where you think the
target<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> think<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.520> right<00:01:14.670> there

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
target is so you think it's right there

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.999 
target is so you think it's right there
and<00:01:15.420> put<00:01:15.750> bring<00:01:15.960> your<00:01:16.080> coil<00:01:16.320> right<00:01:16.500> over<00:01:16.740> here

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and put bring your coil right over here

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.109 
and put bring your coil right over here
and<00:01:17.159> groundouts<00:01:17.970> reground<00:01:18.750> mount<00:01:19.970> what<00:01:20.970> we're

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and groundouts reground mount what we're

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.270 
and groundouts reground mount what we're
doing<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.689> ruined<00:01:22.170> ground<00:01:22.439> bounds<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.070> that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
doing is we ruined ground bounds to that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
doing is we ruined ground bounds to that
level<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.880> dirt<00:01:24.119> where<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.049> target

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
level of dirt where we think the target

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.010 
level of dirt where we think the target
is<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:26.130> your<00:01:26.310> ground<00:01:26.580> bounce<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:27.150> here<00:01:27.420> you're

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
is if your ground bounce up here you're

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.420 
is if your ground bounce up here you're
fooling<00:01:28.439> yourself<00:01:28.829> you're<00:01:29.009> fooling<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
fooling yourself you're fooling the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.910 
fooling yourself you're fooling the
machine<00:01:29.729> pulls<00:01:30.030> ground<00:01:30.659> bounce<00:01:30.900> right<00:01:31.500> off<00:01:31.560> to

machine pulls ground bounce right off to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
machine pulls ground bounce right off to
the<00:01:32.040> side<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.490> why<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:33.000> make<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.360> big

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the side that's why we make this big

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.950 
the side that's why we make this big
flipping<00:01:34.079> flat<00:01:35.040> spot<00:01:38.090> we're<00:01:39.090> digging<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.750> ease

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
flipping flat spot we're digging if ease

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.460 
that most people miss you guys here that
we're<00:01:48.600> down<00:01:48.750> about<00:01:48.960> six<00:01:49.380> inches<00:01:51.170> okay<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.229> it's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
we're down about six inches okay so it's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.600 
we're down about six inches okay so it's
right<00:01:52.619> about<00:01:52.860> there<00:01:52.920> all<00:01:53.280> right<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:53.520> gonna

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
right about there all right I'm gonna

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.160 
right about there all right I'm gonna
take<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:54.060> more<00:01:54.299> off<00:01:59.570> get<00:02:00.570> down<00:02:00.869> there

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
take a little more off get down there

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.850 
take a little more off get down there
now<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.250> about<00:02:04.009> about<00:02:05.009> 10<00:02:05.520> inches<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.210> far

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.700 

it's<00:02:10.860> rising<00:02:11.370> up<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.450> then<00:02:12.720> down<00:02:12.960> just<00:02:13.350> like<00:02:13.530> I

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it's rising up and then down just like I

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.400 
it's rising up and then down just like I
taught<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.040> guys<00:02:14.400> from<00:02:14.730> day<00:02:14.880> one<00:02:15.230> except<00:02:16.230> not

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
taught you guys from day one except not

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.810 
taught you guys from day one except not
quite<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.950> loud<00:02:19.040> now<00:02:20.040> lift<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.400> coil<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
quite that loud now lift that coil and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:31.040 
quite that loud now lift that coil and
make<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.090> weaker<00:02:24.200> keep<00:02:25.200> lifted<00:02:29.870> that's<00:02:30.870> what

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
make it weaker keep lifted that's what

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.690 
make it weaker keep lifted that's what
we<00:02:31.140> barely<00:02:31.410> heard<00:02:31.710> right<00:02:31.980> at<00:02:32.100> first<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:32.520> a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
we barely heard right at first just a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:44.270 
we barely heard right at first just a
slight<00:02:33.060> rise<00:02:42.440> that's<00:02:43.440> how<00:02:43.680> when<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.980> get<00:02:44.100> down

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
slight rise that's how when you get down

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.010 
slight rise that's how when you get down
to<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.610> hard<00:02:44.880> pan<00:02:45.150> folks<00:02:45.480> that's<00:02:45.720> what<00:02:45.810> you

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
to that hard pan folks that's what you

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.380 
to that hard pan folks that's what you
want<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.290> do<00:02:46.440> go<00:02:47.190> around<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:47.670> like<00:02:47.940> she<00:02:48.090> is
