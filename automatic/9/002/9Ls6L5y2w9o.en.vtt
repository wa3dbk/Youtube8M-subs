00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Hi everyone and today Anton 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.370
 Zimin will show how to distribute the image of Cinderella 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.299
 tender romantic which is great 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.280
 come find 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.349
 for starters of course we put the base 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:18.779
 under the shadows so they will hold on much 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:20.279
 longer and the pigment will give a brighter and for 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.689
 eye makeup anton uses 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.760
 a limited palette of shadows from 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.650
 Cinderella collection all moving eyelid 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.300
 science is the brightest shade and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.300
 shading it down to the brow 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.950
 a fold of the century put darker shadows 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.930
 mixing with two shades and further 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 Shade them well to obtain 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.700
 such a smooth transition and creating 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.559
 a certain haze forever we can 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.719
 observe a colossal eye difference 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.649
 it looks like a large volume appears 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.649
 of course the depth 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.520
 and apply the same shade on the bottom 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:24.440
 eyelid and well shading was visible 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:26.840
 boundaries from he decided not to do a little eyebrows 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.000
 brighter and for their design use 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.590
 shadows with the same palette me very 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.149
 I liked the result especially me 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.880
 liked the shape and 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.100
 how shade shadows harmonize with their 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.500
 natural hair shade is very 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.619
 naturally it happened but at the same time 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.960
 eyebrows och beautifully highlighted the entire makeup 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.060
 we fix the moisturizing spray we gave already 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.250
 we put powder on slightly moistened face 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.970
 highlighter so it will fix better 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.700
 face and 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.220
 and the pigment will be much brighter applied and 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.420
 of course on the cheekbones on the back of the nose and on 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.899
 a tick above the upper lip in advance 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.000
 moisturizes lip balm to look 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.530
 become more open and makeup brighter 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.530
 Of course we paint the eyelashes with mascara 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:23.099
 correct makeup and apply concealer 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.930
 under the eyes and now it is time lips 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.909
 draw a path to give them 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:38.159
 clearer outlines and add 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:40.349
 a bit of color and on top we apply gloss for 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:48.659
 lips called graphic particles with him 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:50.250
 they look a little more further 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.139
 Anton is wearing a very interesting product. 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.150
 This shine for eyes gives very 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:58.849
 beautiful glow and that way 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.849

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.290
