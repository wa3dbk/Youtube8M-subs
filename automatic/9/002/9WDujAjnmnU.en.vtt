if<00:00:00.120> actually<00:00:00.570> point<00:00:01.020> 70<00:00:01.740> inches<00:00:02.280> thick<00:00:02.810> it's

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
if actually point 70 inches thick it's

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.710 
if actually point 70 inches thick it's
very<00:00:04.049> good<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.620> it's<00:00:05.609> made<00:00:05.850> out<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.029> all<00:00:06.359> part

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
very good and it's made out of all part

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.560 
very good and it's made out of all part
of<00:00:06.839> viral<00:00:07.319> so<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.280> entire<00:00:08.400> chassis<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.540> made

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
of viral so this entire chassis is made

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.110 
of viral so this entire chassis is made
out<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.929> carbon<00:00:10.230> fiber<00:00:10.380> not<00:00:11.280> just<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.670> lid<00:00:11.849> and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
out of carbon fiber not just a lid and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.270 
out of carbon fiber not just a lid and
it<00:00:12.509> has<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.809> beautiful<00:00:12.870> carbon<00:00:13.740> fiber<00:00:13.980> we

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
it has this beautiful carbon fiber we

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.240 
it has this beautiful carbon fiber we
monitor<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.660> probably<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:16.190> by<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
monitor as you can probably see by the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.210 
monitor as you can probably see by the
camera<00:00:18.109> now<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.170> interesting<00:00:19.830> thing<00:00:20.070> about

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
camera now the interesting thing about

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.370 
camera now the interesting thing about
that<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:21.000> also<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.449> different<00:00:21.900> finishes

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
that is we also have different finishes

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.529 
that is we also have different finishes
that<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:22.920> attach<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.789> not<00:00:24.269> only<00:00:24.420> can

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
that we can attach this so not only can

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.240 
that we can attach this so not only can
you<00:00:24.720> get<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> standard<00:00:25.350> black<00:00:25.590> carbon<00:00:25.949> fiber

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
you get the standard black carbon fiber

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.400 
you get the standard black carbon fiber
finish<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.090> we're<00:00:27.240> also<00:00:27.330> doing<00:00:27.570> custom<00:00:28.140> paint

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
finish so we're also doing custom paint

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.560 
finish so we're also doing custom paint
works<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.859> really<00:00:29.400> really<00:00:29.570> amazing

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
works like really really amazing

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.720 
works like really really amazing

did in the last year was we expanded our
facility<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:35.280> made<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> provisions<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.300> be

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
facility we made the provisions to be

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.180 
facility we made the provisions to be
able<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.690> do<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.230> any<00:00:37.739> color<00:00:38.010> you

another<00:00:52.359> man<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.829> make<00:00:54.010> it<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:54.309> thin<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.940> a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
another man to make it so thin is a

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.939 
another man to make it so thin is a
display<00:00:55.629> this<00:00:56.469> displays<00:00:56.890> a<00:00:56.920> 13.3<00:00:57.789> inch

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
display this displays a 13.3 inch

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.709 
display this displays a 13.3 inch
led-backlit<00:00:59.949> display<00:01:00.370> it's<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.329> brightest

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
led-backlit display it's the brightest

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.090 
led-backlit display it's the brightest
display<00:01:02.079> we've<00:01:02.260> ever<00:01:02.409> used<00:01:02.500> on<00:01:02.829> a<00:01:02.859> notebook

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
display we've ever used on a notebook

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.039 
display we've ever used on a notebook
and<00:01:03.519> you'll<00:01:03.729> also<00:01:03.909> notice<00:01:04.210> it's<00:01:04.449> flush<00:01:04.750> glass

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
and you'll also notice it's flush glass

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.999 
and you'll also notice it's flush glass
so<00:01:05.470> there's<00:01:05.649> no<00:01:05.799> like<00:01:06.189> no<00:01:06.790> noticeable<00:01:07.299> order

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
so there's no like no noticeable order

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.249 
so there's no like no noticeable order
it's<00:01:09.009> just<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.450> greatness<00:01:10.689> of<00:01:10.960> my<00:01:11.080> foot

it's just it's a greatness of my foot
and<00:01:11.470> like<00:01:11.830> I<00:01:11.950> said<00:01:12.009> it's<00:01:12.220> super<00:01:12.520> bright<00:01:12.640> it

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
and like I said it's super bright it

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.670 
and like I said it's super bright it
also<00:01:13.270> has<00:01:13.450> an<00:01:13.539> ambient<00:01:13.990> light<00:01:14.110> sensor<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.590> the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
also has an ambient light sensor of the

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.800 
also has an ambient light sensor of the
display<00:01:15.039> so<00:01:15.580> that<00:01:15.610> when<00:01:16.210> you're<00:01:16.390> actually

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
display so that when you're actually

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.749 
display so that when you're actually
using<00:01:17.289> it<00:01:17.740> depending<00:01:18.220> on<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.369> light<00:01:18.490> in<00:01:18.670> the

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
using it depending on the light in the

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.029 
using it depending on the light in the
room<00:01:18.789> giggle<00:01:19.720> dim<00:01:19.929> or<00:01:20.200> are<00:01:20.500> right<00:01:20.830> now

things like that yep yep and so on so

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:33.690 
things like that yep yep and so on so
turn<00:01:32.470> on<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.619> notebook<00:01:32.890> this<00:01:33.190> thing<00:01:33.429> it's

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
turn on a notebook this thing it's

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.249 
turn on a notebook this thing it's
normally<00:01:34.060> impossible<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.840> put<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.020> battery

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
normally impossible to put a battery

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.380 
normally impossible to put a battery
removable<00:01:36.069> battery<00:01:36.399> in<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.610> notebook<00:01:36.789> but

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
removable battery in the notebook but

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.639 
removable battery in the notebook but
because<00:01:37.720> we<00:01:37.869> made<00:01:37.990> out<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.289> carbon<00:01:38.530> fiber

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
because we made out of carbon fiber

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.859 
because we made out of carbon fiber
we're<00:01:39.459> actually<00:01:39.549> having<00:01:39.819> to<00:01:40.000> do<00:01:40.209> it<00:01:40.330> this<00:01:40.720> is

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
we're actually having to do it this is

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.539 
we're actually having to do it this is
the<00:01:40.990> battery<00:01:41.259> here<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:42.039> actually<00:01:42.250> does

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
the battery here this actually does

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.080 
the battery here this actually does
happen<00:01:45.000> alright<00:01:46.000> so<00:01:46.179> better<00:01:46.420> if<00:01:46.659> you<00:01:46.810> see<00:01:47.080> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
happen alright so better if you see it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.210 
happen alright so better if you see it
next<00:01:49.090> thing<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.840> notebook<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:50.679> sit<00:01:50.950> right

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
next thing is the notebook is sit right

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.789 
next thing is the notebook is sit right
you<00:01:51.490> can't<00:01:51.759> happen<00:01:52.030> ethernet<00:01:52.840> port<00:01:53.080> on<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.259> so

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
you can't happen ethernet port on it so

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.919 
you can't happen ethernet port on it so
rather<00:01:54.009> than<00:01:54.280> giving<00:01:54.970> our<00:01:55.179> customers<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.599> weird

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
rather than giving our customers a weird

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.330 
rather than giving our customers a weird
adapter<00:01:56.470> or<00:01:56.619> something<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.039> they<00:01:57.069> have<00:01:57.250> to

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
adapter or something that they have to

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.469 
adapter or something that they have to
carry<00:01:57.580> around<00:01:57.640> within<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.209> they<00:01:58.360> might

brick right here this is the power point
let's<00:02:04.509> go<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.410> ethernet<00:02:05.739> cord<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.099> right

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
let's go and the ethernet cord is right
