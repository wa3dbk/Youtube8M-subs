00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120
 nothing like discovering the origin of your 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.120
 favorite character right after the table 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.650
 Desert I am luiz goalie does not read and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.960
 hears about a book I already had 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.119
 I read a lot of time and I wanted to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.430
 A lot of talking about it here for you is the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.050
 book is a narrative that is to fulfill 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.300
 sherlock holmes who have all the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.460
 Shock Stories With One But It's The Book 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.559
 more specifically a study in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.860
 red that was the first novel 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.040
 published by arthur conan doyle with 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.180
 shock thefts as protagonist publish 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.500
 there in 1987 in a magazine or newspaper some 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.329
 thing so he got there and then 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.149
 in 1888 it was published as a novel in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.789
 book format in this book here as 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.960
 always a sherlock holmes is wanted 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.120
 by the police 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.059
 not in this way not in a criminal way nor 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.400
 wanted by the police to try 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.640
 solve a puzzle that scotland yard 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.530
 the great police claw of england 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.320
 they were not finding out that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.470
 was in which the man was found dead 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.960
 with an expression of terror on his face alone 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.650
 that without wounds and surrounded by stains 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.140
 blood and I'm planning is not in 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.210
 home there because no one went to see 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.400
 had happened some thought he 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.229
 had been murdered 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.549
 actually not much but great 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.579
 majority thought he had committed 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.850
 Suicide only that it rains as it arrived 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.619
 to walk with a suicide case 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.810
 and there really began to 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.909
 investigation in fact a study in 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.030
 red as well as being a first book 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.159
 romance of arthur conan doyle telling 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.229
 home shock story showing him 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.960
 solve a case it is much more than 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.329
 because it begins beyond the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.250
 sherlock holmes's story in truth 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.860
 not his story is what 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.280
 begins the history of novels with 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.190
 friendship of shock romi.com option because 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.380
 in that book they end up 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.450
 and being the guy is very lacking because I 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.100
 I've read some sherlock homes and 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.840
 some conduct also only that I do not 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.330
 I had and I did not start by reading 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.160
 technology then know that the 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.560
 two were friends that the shock was 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.480
 fuck and that the organ the doctor who was 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.590
 accompanying them will know how to 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.750
 everything started 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.710
 until I ended up watching a 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.900
 london bbc series shot at love 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.120
 of what I believe you with 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.360
 sure must know why aided 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.760
 very cool that was transcribed for 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.980
 our reality today and face 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.840
 I was ecstatic then make a 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.480
 study in red with the perfection that 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.980
 they managed to transpose a book there 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.440
 19th century 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.260
 to protect today and following a 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.360
 achieving in a way to follow much 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.610
 faithfully the book and it was something 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.560
 He gave much more horny no 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.480
 I also think that book is very 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.570
 more if I had read the book 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.720
 first existed but after the holiday 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.300
 it is still a point and it gave a seasoning 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.070
 the most in history and another thing that 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.260
 very happy reading a study in 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.510
 because it's been a long time since I 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.630
 I did not read a police thriller that was 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.370
 police officer is older than we are 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.500
 did not have all the 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.510
 technology that kind of thing that 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.670
 people today have vehicles and 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.130
 adam brown that kind of thing I think 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.100
 the last book in this Linense 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.860
 footprint yes but old police officer knows 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.500
 type of former police officer was of the club 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.900
 canceled the spy that by the way is very 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.480
 good is an excellent police thriller of 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.610
 time and I really like this kind of 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.459
 book because it is certain that the guys 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.180
 I did not have the technology to finish selling 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:56.780
 all kind of life my show that he 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.459
 I went there with which magnifying glass he is looking for and 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.800
 It is interesting that he arrives 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.140
 really use his head because like him 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.750
 did not have any technological artifact 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.330
 so many so sophisticated to use it 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.150
 had to think and really use his 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.730
 art of deduction which is one of the points 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.140
 of this first book 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.620
 including those that a chapter that 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.690
 call the art of seduction 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.000
 realistic and begins to understand how 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.370
 head works shock shoplifting and 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.229
 begins to pay a lot more stick to them and 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.810
 see that the guy is my dear, it 's a fuck it 's a 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.190
 very fucking character and it has to be 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.260
 a genius to be able to enter a 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.630
 character of this type because the 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.910
 amount of detail you are going to 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.060
 picking up the book and going into the 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.040
 history is surprising even 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.000
 own history divided into two parts 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.220
 the first part 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.070
 narrated by a first person pilot 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.380
 which he tells how he met the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.690
 xerox as they were there own 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.780
 apartment like it like that was it 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.660
 meeting of the two that is very funny 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.530
 It's very similar to the cerrado so I 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.720
 I find it cool 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.300
 but also has the introduction to the 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.520
 car and they investigate and at the end 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.460
 first pet or arrived here it already 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.580
 solved the case and already speaks the culprit is 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.490
 This you're stuck with everything I've been through. 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.070
 as well as 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.860
 already solved the book in half in the world 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.349
 You could have solved the case now and then. 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.360
 enters the second part of the book that is 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:28.060
 written in the third person that is the whole 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.360
 investigative process and logical deduction 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.000
 that passes through the head of sherlock holmes 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.539
 from when he was presented the case 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.729
 until the end of it until when it came to 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.250
 find out who was to blame then you 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.380
 practically average in the head of the xerox 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.479
 and start trying to think with it and not 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.960
 we talk to tripoli, you think dude like me 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:52.419
 I'm so good I did not realize it's so 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.280
 Of course it was here in my face and I 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.620
 I did not realize that this guy was the culprit. 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.680
 when it all the details begin to 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.199
 fit perfectly you think 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.699
 in this story very fucking and even 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.310
 when it comes to the end when I arrived 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:10.570
 in the end I thought dude but it's over 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:13.150
 That feeling I want more knows. 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.680
 finally a great book of the kombis whip 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.690
 I still do not think it's the best I 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.120
 I think the campus described how it is 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.160
 on top who can not get over that 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.860
 I do not know if it was for my first 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.289
 experience reading something left 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.150
 So far I have stayed so far. 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.860
 so open - mouthed that it was 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.460
 largely to keep thinking he is 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.710
 the best 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.600
 including the first video of the channel is 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.759
 b left kronos that was when I 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.259
 I began to read everything yet 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:40.690
 A study in red is a very 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:42.759
 fuck first for being the first 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.729
 story of the rome shock along with atom 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:48.550
 that shows if knowing and second by 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:50.380
 own development of history and 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.300
 how it is conducted for us 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.460
 reach the end and know who it really is 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.310
 the guilty and something else that is very 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.949
 funny even follows the same 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:02.500
 steps from the bbc series is that when 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:05.410
 great is the sherlock mine 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.599
 everybody thinks charlotte is 11 in the 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.880
 tyco knows a boat of one knows he is 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:12.310
 very fan of the world and will be new study 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.590
 There is no way to give him less money. 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.930
 who is so stupid with things almost 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:21.160
 Sherlock's dream that while it's never been 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.909
 a whimsical throw and a cap is very 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.849
 strong 

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:26.919
 As you have seen, you know then, so is the 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:29.860
 book if you like literature 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:32.080
 classic or you have to read sherlock 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.050
 holmes if you like law books 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.599
 You have to read this story through 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.039
 less a red study and that's it 

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:40.720
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:42.550
 video soon I intend to do more 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.870
 videos about sherlock holmes 

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.370
 so it was taking some time 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.680
 mainly because I want to read more 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:50.530
 some stories that is great is to have a 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.729
 stage the same footprint of the Romans is not 

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.969
 such a long story 

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:57.759
 Curtinhas are stories that have against 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:08:00.759
 255 ten pages 13 it 's really cool, I hope 

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:03.280
 see he is very fast to bet 

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:05.440
 Who form their opinion of you? 

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.979
 I hope you have enjoyed the video and even 

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.979
 the next
