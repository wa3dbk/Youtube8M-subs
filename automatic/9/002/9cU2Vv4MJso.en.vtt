once<00:00:39.300> that's<00:00:39.480> done<00:00:39.719> set<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.110> aside<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.860> can

I<00:00:42.090> used<00:00:42.780> gum<00:00:43.020> paste<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.590> where<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> made<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
I used gum paste here where I made a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.139 
I used gum paste here where I made a
large<00:00:45.030> ball<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.660> medium<00:00:46.260> ball<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.190> small

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
ball the small is his coffee cup so I

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.549 
ball the small is his coffee cup so I
made<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.480> into<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> cylinder<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.350> put<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
made that into a cylinder and put a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.490 
made that into a cylinder and put a
little<00:00:52.739> dip<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> top<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.140> then<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.170> used

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
little dip in the top and then I used

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.069 
little dip in the top and then I used
another<00:00:55.710> large<00:00:56.340> ball<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.239> same<00:00:57.420> size<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
another large ball the same size as the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.010 
another large ball the same size as the
bottom<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.800> shape<00:00:59.460> his<00:00:59.670> head<00:00:59.940> now<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.719> rolled

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
bottom to shape his head now I rolled

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.250

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that into a pear shape and then cut in

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.289

his<00:01:04.650> mouth<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.339> lifted<00:01:05.670> his<00:01:05.790> lip<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299

his mouth and just lifted his lip and
manipulated<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.110> around<00:01:08.210> for<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> bottom

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.539 
manipulated that around for the bottom
of<00:01:09.689> his<00:01:09.900> body<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.290> cut<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> bottom<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.280> make<00:01:11.369> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
of his body I cut the bottom to make it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.600 
of his body I cut the bottom to make it
sit<00:01:11.760> flat<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.710> then<00:01:13.710> place<00:01:13.950> them<00:01:14.159> all<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.359 
sit flat and then place them all on the
skewers<00:01:15.060> his<00:01:15.990> mouth<00:01:16.290> needed<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.890> reworked

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
skewers his mouth needed to be reworked

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
skewers his mouth needed to be reworked
I'm<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.970> think<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.900> because<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> was

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
I'm I think this is just because it was

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
I'm I think this is just because it was
gum<00:01:19.619> paste<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> first<00:01:20.850> time<00:01:21.030> I've

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
gum paste this is the first time I've

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.210 
gum paste this is the first time I've
used<00:01:21.390> gum<00:01:21.600> paste<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> bit<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
used gum paste so it was a bit of a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
used gum paste so it was a bit of a
trial<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.700> error<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.119> me<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.420> noticed<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.080> I

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
trial and error for me I noticed as I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.080 
trial and error for me I noticed as I
kept<00:01:25.439> working<00:01:25.619> with<00:01:25.950> his<00:01:26.070> head<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.520> he's<00:01:26.790> lip

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
kept working with his head that he's lip

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.600 
kept working with his head that he's lip
kept<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.720> back<00:01:27.900> into<00:01:28.350> place<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.520> had

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
kept going back into place so I just had

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.330 
kept going back into place so I just had
to<00:01:29.700> keep<00:01:29.820> manipulating<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.689> out<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.170> used<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
to keep manipulating that out I used a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.719 
to keep manipulating that out I used a
piece<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.700> orange<00:01:33.299> starburst<00:01:34.280> taffy<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
piece of orange starburst taffy for the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.480 
piece of orange starburst taffy for the
carrot<00:01:36.299> nose<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.869> two<00:01:37.500> round<00:01:37.860> balls<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
carrot nose and two round balls for the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.580 
carrot nose and two round balls for the
eyes<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.090> then<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.570> paint<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> details

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
eyes and then just paint on the details

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.580 
eyes and then just paint on the details
with<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> eyes<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> who<00:01:43.079> eyelid

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
with the eyes you just do a who eyelid

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.100 
with the eyes you just do a who eyelid
in<00:01:43.799> blue<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.850> black<00:01:45.090> dot<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.630> some

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
in blue and then a black dot and some

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.530

eyebrows<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:47.040> his<00:01:47.220> hair<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> used<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.119> fine
