I<00:04:41.670> actually<00:04:42.120> just<00:04:42.510> favored<00:04:42.810> Mac<00:04:43.620> Paint<00:04:44.130> Pots

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
I actually just favored Mac Paint Pots

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.330 
I actually just favored Mac Paint Pots
because<00:04:44.910> they<00:04:45.060> last<00:04:46.100> months<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:47.190> months

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
because they last months and months

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.100 
because they last months and months
longer<00:04:47.670> than<00:04:47.790> a<00:04:47.940> standard<00:04:48.030> primer<00:04:48.660> would

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
longer than a standard primer would

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.920 
longer than a standard primer would
so<00:04:49.500> definitely<00:04:49.920> prime<00:04:50.280> your<00:04:50.520> eye<00:04:50.550> because
