 delicious recipe for ourselves the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.619
 preparation our houses and is that already 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.140
 has been a strawberry season that has been 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.750
 use it in an original recipe and not 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.690
 that is why what we are going to do today is a 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.129
 cherry risotto and for this recipe what 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.340
 What we need are the following 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.340
 ingredients 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:51.530
 75,000 liters of chicken broth 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.230
 90 grams of special rice for all 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.770
 90 milliliters of white wine 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.570
 of 35 milliliters of our weights 75 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.110
 grams of strawberry 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.560
 a quarter of onion 35 grams of 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.840
 butter plus salt and pepper and 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.020
 you can start to elaborate the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.020
 recipe 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 ah 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.150
 The first thing I have done before anything is 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.590
 catch and put the chicken broth to boil 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.060
 Now what I'm going to do is take the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.590
 fourth of the onion that I said before and 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.150
 I'm going to cut it with the help of a knife 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.150
 in very very small pieces 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.990
 to simmer 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.930
 of the 25 grams of butter what 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.760
 you have seen and I will let it go once 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.909
 sunk the butter we're going to throw 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.079
 the onion and we're going to leave it for 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:02:00.240
 once the onion was found in the 90's 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.240
 grams of rice and we will leave them 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.290
 completely butter once 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.150
 we already have the rice well impregnated with 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.880
 the butter we're going to take the 90 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.650
 milliliters of success 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.320
 to leave here by the way until it 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.330
 evaporate once the rice has 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.340
 absorbed from the plane the wine what we 're going 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.930
 to do is take the vegetable broth 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.960
 that we have put to heat before we go 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.480
 to take a ladle in this way there 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.420
 be careful that we like it and we will let it go 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.810
 throwing the rice and let's repeat this 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.940
 process every time the chicken stock 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.100
 excursion while cooking 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.630
 what he has done is take some 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.420
 how many strawberries I have reserved 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.860
 one already to refine decorate the plate the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.960
 you have seen the washing I have removed 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.180
 what is the rabito and now with the help of 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.480
 I'm going to crush a fork very very 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.480
 all right 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.930
 once we have rice already almost 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.190
 ready let's add the strawberries already 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.840
 crushed 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.640
 and we're going to remove it very well and the 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.620
 let's cook 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.000
 Now that we have practically seen 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.060
 in our apartment what is left is 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.190
 add what cream is to take as 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.250
 You see, it's a pretty slow cream I like 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.250
 a lot for free all 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.050
 the rector we resorted well we are going to 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.050
 add salt and pepper to taste 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.620
 now carries factor housing 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.620
 or it is falling 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.180
 and we're going to mix everything all very 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.340
 all right 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.140
 now with the strawberry that reserved what 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.530
 I'm going to do is break it into slices 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.000
 to decorate the plate 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.890
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.200
 proceed to plate the dish for it 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.700
 let's take a pan that we 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.830
 already removed from the fire, notice that 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.200
 we want is the rice this is 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.200
 perfect we will pass 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.659
 to take carefully 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.510
 for quintÃ¡s for 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.490
 life 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.180
 Now all that remains is 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.640
 decorate with the strawberry that we have cut 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.579
 for this we are going to place it 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.519
 this perfect shape 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.739
 and well we have our risotto ready 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.289
