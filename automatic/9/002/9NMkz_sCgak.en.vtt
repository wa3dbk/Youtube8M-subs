you're feeding it through make sure the
strings<00:06:19.990> are<00:06:20.139> lined<00:06:20.380> up<00:06:20.530> there<00:06:20.860> and<00:06:21.160> then

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
strings are lined up there and then

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.159 
strings are lined up there and then
they're<00:06:21.430> proper<00:06:21.850> slots<00:06:22.180> especially<00:06:23.020> on<00:06:23.080> an

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
they're proper slots especially on an

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.060 
they're proper slots especially on an
electric<00:06:23.530> guitar

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
electric guitar

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.820 
electric guitar
they'll<00:06:24.490> have<00:06:24.639> both<00:06:25.180> have<00:06:25.449> slots<00:06:25.840> they<00:06:26.680> can

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
they'll have both have slots they can

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.240 
they'll have both have slots they can
easily<00:06:27.190> fall<00:06:27.490> through<00:06:27.520> the<00:06:27.880> cracks<00:06:29.130> mr.<00:06:30.130> bean

easily fall through the cracks mr. bean

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.960 
easily fall through the cracks mr. bean
or<00:06:30.400> they<00:06:30.520> may<00:06:30.610> not<00:06:30.789> be<00:06:31.000> in<00:06:31.510> the<00:06:31.630> grooves<00:06:33.240> and<00:06:35.970> up

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
here as well make sure it's in the slot

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.279 
here as well make sure it's in the slot
because<00:06:39.100> I've<00:06:39.449> done<00:06:40.449> that<00:06:40.630> a<00:06:40.660> hundred<00:06:40.870> times<00:06:40.990> I

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
because I've done that a hundred times I

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.950 
because I've done that a hundred times I
wind<00:06:41.770> up<00:06:41.889> the<00:06:41.979> string<00:06:42.510> while<00:06:43.510> they<00:06:43.630> find<00:06:43.840> it

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
wind up the string while they find it

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.270 
wind up the string while they find it
that<00:06:44.110> it's<00:06:44.260> falling<00:06:44.710> through<00:06:44.860> the<00:06:44.919> slider

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
that it's falling through the slider

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.080 
that it's falling through the slider
it's<00:06:45.520> not<00:06:45.700> lined<00:06:45.910> up<00:06:47.610> okay<00:06:48.639> best<00:06:48.940> way<00:06:49.060> to

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
it's not lined up okay best way to

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.050 
it's not lined up okay best way to
determine<00:06:49.690> the<00:06:49.960> length<00:06:50.370> the<00:06:51.370> slack<00:06:51.639> and<00:06:51.970> all

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
determine the length the slack and all

00:06:52.060 --> 00:07:00.930 
determine the length the slack and all
the<00:06:52.150> strings<00:06:52.450> go<00:06:54.090> to<00:06:55.090> the<00:06:55.180> 12th<00:06:55.479> fret<00:06:56.910> and

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.380 

four<00:07:01.510> fingers<00:07:01.840> like<00:07:02.560> well<00:07:03.370> an<00:07:03.880> adult<00:07:04.180> hand

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
four fingers like well an adult hand

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.580 
four fingers like well an adult hand
anyway<00:07:05.610> we're<00:07:06.610> about<00:07:06.880> three<00:07:07.180> or<00:07:07.270> four<00:07:07.390> inches

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590 
anyway we're about three or four inches

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.450 
anyway we're about three or four inches
that's<00:07:08.590> how<00:07:08.680> much<00:07:08.800> slack<00:07:09.040> you<00:07:09.160> should<00:07:09.310> give

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
that's how much slack you should give

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.170 
that's how much slack you should give
yourself<00:07:09.600> so<00:07:10.600> once<00:07:10.750> you<00:07:10.870> have<00:07:11.080> the<00:07:12.180> four

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
yourself so once you have the four

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.520 
yourself so once you have the four
inches<00:07:13.420> there<00:07:14.190> just<00:07:15.690> bend<00:07:16.690> the<00:07:17.080> string<00:07:17.290> right

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.530 
inches there just bend the string right

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:23.330 
inches there just bend the string right
behind<00:07:17.800> the<00:07:18.070> peg<00:07:18.670> so<00:07:19.830> just<00:07:20.830> messed<00:07:20.980> up<00:07:22.020> okay

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 
behind the peg so just messed up okay

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.980 
behind the peg so just messed up okay
let<00:07:24.340> other<00:07:24.490> things<00:07:24.520> I<00:07:24.940> know<00:07:25.870> you<00:07:26.620> can<00:07:27.990> start

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990 
let other things I know you can start

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.260
