00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.950
 let's see then how he used 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:12.639
 variables in this little minigame 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.639
 remember that this application 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.140
 as we see I impart with a counter of 10 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:26.680
 and every time I go selecting from 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.680
 turn off the annoying 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.309
 every time I go selecting one of 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.680
 these differences is counter going 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.320
 decreasing in one that I have one of the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.390
 first differences I have it low me to 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.149
 nine but reduction 9 rogue to another 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.610
 difference it is subtracting me at night 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.170
 then he as the characteristic of the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.120
 advantage that variables offer us 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.620
 for example in this case obviously the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.079
 flexibility is quite but in this 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.079
 case we are using a simple counter 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.360
 that is decreasing as we go 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.649
 finding the differences now how 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.620
 this works 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.629
 plate 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.580
 The first thing I do is define a 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.580
 variable since I have it here 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.640
 I have an accountant here if you look at 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.640
 this counter 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.290
 this counter 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.409
 is a text basically a text like 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.810
 anyone but in which I indicate and 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.590
 he pointed it out with a variable because what 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.240
 identified with the signs percentage 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.760
 starts with a percentage and ends with 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.730
 a percentage 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.520
 and all this is handled through this 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.890
 variable handler that we have in the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.590
 article said here and I can see all 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.460
 the variables that I have defined fixed in 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.610
 this in this case they define in the 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.340
 variable is called count and part with a 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.670
 default value of 10 which is the value 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.820
 which part when you start or launch the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.820
 application then now how do I go 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.709
 lowering the counter increasing everything 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.810
 what this has to do is this 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.360
 accountant for each of the differences 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.660
 they fix each of the differences that I 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.140
 I have here I have a difference of 23 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.819
 etcetera on each of them 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.769
 draw ovals here I have oval one in 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.220
 the fund is diego or vagos one for each 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:36.269
 difference then what's interesting is 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.420
 that every time I click on a 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.750
 ovalo obviously catillo an event here 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.459
 I have the oval one that would come 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.470
 making this difference and my look 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.590
 in what I do let's give it a double 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.599
 click to open the window and it tells me that 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.510
 the action will consist of showing 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.090
 laws that you law in one or laws or the 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.430
 layer one when when the click makes a 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.160
 click on it on the oval one that goes 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.170
 to be about this button as invisible 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.079
 that I have this button is simply 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.090
 an ordinary button only that 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:14.480
 I told him not to have no 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.760
 is not painted and does not have a border 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.129
 and then do not have the color in the background 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.450
 it looks like a transparent button and it 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.540
 remember I'm not saying that I 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.939
 show the legend 1 the leger 1 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.879
 in the background what it does is that 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.310
 shows in a prominent way the 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.790
 difference and it also makes me add 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.269
 a small one of a little sound now 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.609
 when the counter is decreased what 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.510
 add here do not assault him what to do 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:49.349
 the click but incorporate it into another 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.379
 in the event in the next event it 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.139
 I will explain it below that I 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.549
 is saying that the action is going to be 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:00.389
 adjust a variable the variable 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.250
 counter that decreases a value 1 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.859
 when you have to do it and here what 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.530
 important thing you have to do when the 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.889
 movie or be lÃ©ger for the movie 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:15.239
 of flash the time of the movie of 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:17.310
 this starts they are fixed then as well as 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.919
 I am triggering the counter 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.570
 decreases the 1 to the best it could 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.520
 have done to every certainty that when 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.900
 I clicked but I preferred to do it 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.330
 more true 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.310
 lessen the complexity of how 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.310
 you saw the whole system just 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.560
 true incorporating it in each of the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.539
 of managed to do for example to visit 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:44.080
 that of jr 2 I have the same action as 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:45.699
 when it ends true that they subtract 1 in what 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.620
 what is the counter 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.050
 then as well as practically 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.970
 uses the subject of accountants in this 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.970
 small mini application
