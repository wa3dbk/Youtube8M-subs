00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
seats down they are 60/40 and it's

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.830 
seats down they are 60/40 and it's
nearly<00:01:45.220> flat<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:46.000> can<00:01:46.120> fit<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.270> ton<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.540> stuff

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
nearly flat you can fit a ton of stuff

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.200 
nearly flat you can fit a ton of stuff
in<00:01:46.960> these<00:01:47.080> also<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:48.010> removable<00:01:48.400> cargo<00:01:48.970> tray

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
in these also the removable cargo tray

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.880 
in these also the removable cargo tray
keeps<00:01:49.780> things<00:01:50.049> hidden<00:01:50.290> from<00:01:50.409> that<00:01:50.710> back

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.130 

okay<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:56.880> now<00:01:57.179> we're<00:01:57.329> behind<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.719> wheel<00:01:57.899> of

okay so now we're behind the wheel of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.849 
okay so now we're behind the wheel of
the<00:01:58.320> 2015<00:01:58.920> Veloster<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.380> push<00:02:01.380> button<00:02:01.740> start

the 2015 Veloster so push button start

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.889 
the 2015 Veloster so push button start
hard<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.579> argue<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.030> especially<00:02:03.539> with

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
hard to argue with that especially with

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.289 
hard to argue with that especially with
the<00:02:04.079> Minnesota<00:02:04.829> winter<00:02:05.189> conditions<00:02:05.759> if

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
like I mentioned earlier I have driven

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.650 
like I mentioned earlier I have driven
one<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.510> these<00:02:24.629> quite<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> bit<00:02:25.970> I'm<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.120> big<00:02:27.360> fan

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
one of these quite a bit I'm a big fan

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.970 
one of these quite a bit I'm a big fan
of<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.870> Veloster<00:02:28.260> when<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.470> first<00:02:28.650> came<00:02:28.860> out

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
of the Veloster when it first came out

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.100 
of the Veloster when it first came out
with<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.190> 1.6<00:02:29.790> liter<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.329> thought<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.959> was<00:02:31.079> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
with the 1.6 liter I thought it was a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.089 
with the 1.6 liter I thought it was a
little<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:31.769> down<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.340> power<00:02:33.530> it's<00:02:34.530> not<00:02:34.769> that

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
little bit down on power it's not that

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.250 
little bit down on power it's not that
it's<00:02:35.220> not<00:02:35.340> fun<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.819> drive<00:02:36.090> with<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.569> but<00:02:36.930> when

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
it's not fun to drive with that but when

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.199 
it's not fun to drive with that but when
you<00:02:37.500> can<00:02:37.709> put<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> turbo<00:02:38.310> on<00:02:38.430> anything<00:02:38.730> I'm

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
you can put a turbo on anything I'm

getting pretty good fuel economy I did
33<00:03:00.310> miles<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.730> gallon<00:03:00.969> on<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.120> highway

33 miles of the gallon on the highway

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.509 
33 miles of the gallon on the highway
and<00:03:01.659> my<00:03:01.719> book<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.200> great<00:03:02.560> if<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.189> drive<00:03:03.489> a

and my book is great if you drive a

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.459 
and my book is great if you drive a
little<00:03:03.640> slower<00:03:03.879> and<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.480> can<00:03:04.659> maintain<00:03:04.840> sixth

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469 
little slower and you can maintain sixth

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.709 
little slower and you can maintain sixth
gear<00:03:05.799> I<00:03:06.010> think<00:03:06.969> you<00:03:07.060> can<00:03:07.180> be<00:03:07.269> able<00:03:07.329> to<00:03:07.480> maybe

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
gear I think you can be able to maybe

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.770 
gear I think you can be able to maybe
even<00:03:07.900> top<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:09.060> handling<00:03:10.060> wise<00:03:10.209> again<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.569> have
