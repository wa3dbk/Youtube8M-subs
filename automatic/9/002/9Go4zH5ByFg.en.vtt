in<00:00:00.750> this<00:00:01.020> video<00:00:01.380> we're<00:00:01.530> going<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.709> take<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.920> look

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.640 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:00:02.340> using<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:03.060> discriminant<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:04.080> determine

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
at using the discriminant to determine

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.619 
at using the discriminant to determine
the<00:00:04.740> number<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.160> solutions<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.210> number<00:00:06.509> of

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
the number of solutions the number of

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.140 
the number of solutions the number of
real<00:00:06.899> solutions<00:00:07.230> in<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:08.340> quadratic<00:00:08.940> equation

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
real solutions in a quadratic equation

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.379 
real solutions in a quadratic equation
the<00:00:10.160> discriminant<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.219> actually<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:12.000> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
the discriminant is actually in the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.530 
the discriminant is actually in the
quadratic<00:00:13.110> formula<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.580> piece<00:00:15.030> right

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
quadratic formula it's this piece right

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.529 
quadratic formula it's this piece right
under<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.199> square<00:00:16.500> root<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.539> depending

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
under the square root here and depending

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.390 
under the square root here and depending
on<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.960> value<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.830> whether<00:00:20.160> it's

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
on the value of that whether it's

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.380 
on the value of that whether it's
positive<00:00:20.900> 0<00:00:21.900> or<00:00:22.289> negative<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:23.609> will<00:00:23.880> tell<00:00:24.180> us

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
positive 0 or negative that will tell us

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.750 
positive 0 or negative that will tell us
how<00:00:24.750> many<00:00:24.810> solutions<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:26.220> quadratic

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
how many solutions that quadratic

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.300 
how many solutions that quadratic
equation<00:00:27.449> will<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.650> so<00:00:28.650> let's<00:00:28.830> take<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> look

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
equation will have so let's take a look

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.370 
equation will have so let's take a look
at<00:00:29.429> what's<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.789> happen<00:00:30.210> here<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.630> turns

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
at what's going to happen here it turns

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.639 
at what's going to happen here it turns
out<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.130> if<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:33.540> right<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
out that if this right here the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.760 
out that if this right here the
discriminant<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.430> greater<00:00:37.309> than<00:00:38.360> zero<00:00:39.770> that's

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
discriminant is greater than zero that's

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.729 
discriminant is greater than zero that's
greater<00:00:41.219> than<00:00:41.340> zero<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.930> there<00:00:43.140> will<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.320> two

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
greater than zero then there will be two

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.389 
greater than zero then there will be two
real<00:00:44.280> solutions<00:00:44.450> and<00:00:45.770> that<00:00:46.770> makes<00:00:47.070> sense

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
real solutions and that makes sense

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.869 
real solutions and that makes sense
because<00:00:48.739> what's<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> happen<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.700> we're

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
because what's going to happen is we're

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.610 
because what's going to happen is we're
going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> get<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> number<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.440> it's

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
going to get a number here if it's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
going to get a number here if it's
positive<00:00:53.219> an<00:00:53.399> example<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.030> positive<00:00:54.239> number

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
positive an example of a positive number

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.619 
positive an example of a positive number
would<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.079> five<00:00:55.789> then<00:00:56.789> we'll<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> number

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
would be five then we'll have a number

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.340 
would be five then we'll have a number
out<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.399> number<00:00:59.699> plus<00:01:00.449> or<00:01:00.780> minus

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
out here so this number plus or minus

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.590 
out here so this number plus or minus
this<00:01:01.890> number<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.609> going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.850> yield<00:01:03.270> two

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
this number is going to yield two

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.260 
this number is going to yield two
different<00:01:04.140> numbers<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.670> why<00:01:05.909> there's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
different numbers so that's why there's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.200 
different numbers so that's why there's
two<00:01:06.330> real<00:01:06.810> solutions<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.250> number<00:01:08.850> inside

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
two real solutions if that number inside

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.929 
two real solutions if that number inside
there<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.720> greater<00:01:10.140> than<00:01:10.350> zero<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.430> second

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
there is greater than zero the second

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.450 
there is greater than zero the second
thing<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.299> happen<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.710> b<00:01:14.040> squared

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
thing that can happen is that b squared

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.780 
thing that can happen is that b squared
minus<00:01:14.580> 4ac<00:01:15.409> again<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> discriminant<00:01:17.189> could

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
minus 4ac again the discriminant could

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.749 
minus 4ac again the discriminant could
be<00:01:17.939> equal<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.600> zero<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.770> case<00:01:20.400> there's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
be equal to zero in that case there's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.109 
be equal to zero in that case there's
going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> be<00:01:21.030> one<00:01:21.509> real<00:01:21.930> solution<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.119> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
going to be one real solution and the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.300 
going to be one real solution and the
reason<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.670> notice<00:01:28.310> what's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
reason for that is if we notice what's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
reason for that is if we notice what's
going<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:31.229> was<00:01:31.530> zero<00:01:32.390> huh<00:01:33.390> what's

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
going on there if it was zero huh what's

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
going on there if it was zero huh what's
going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.290> happen<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> number<00:01:35.549> out

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
going to happen so we have a number out

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.069 
going to happen so we have a number out
here<00:01:35.930> plus<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.229> minus<00:01:37.710> zero<00:01:38.659> well<00:01:39.659> does<00:01:39.960> it

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
here plus or minus zero well does it

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.700 
here plus or minus zero well does it
matter<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.710> add<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.310> subtract<00:01:41.909> zero<00:01:42.420> no<00:01:43.229> so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
matter if you add or subtract zero no so

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.530 
matter if you add or subtract zero no so
there's<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.700> one<00:01:45.119> solution

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
there's just going to be one solution

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.960 
there's just going to be one solution
that<00:01:46.110> comes<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.220> they're

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
that comes out of this because they're

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.899 
that comes out of this because they're
the<00:01:48.210> same<00:01:48.240> plus<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> minus<00:01:49.680> zero<00:01:50.100> are<00:01:50.430> both

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the same plus and minus zero are both

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.990 
the same plus and minus zero are both
the<00:01:51.119> same<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.630> there's<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:52.079> real<00:01:52.380> solution

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
the same so there's one real solution

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.580 
the same so there's one real solution
finally<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.329> third<00:01:54.659> thing<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.350> happen

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
finally the third thing that can happen

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.100 
finally the third thing that can happen
is<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.460> discriminant<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> b<00:01:57.570> squared<00:01:57.869> minus

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
is the discriminant the b squared minus

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.480 
is the discriminant the b squared minus
4ac<00:01:59.060> can<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.270> less<00:02:00.570> than<00:02:00.869> zero<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:02.189> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
4ac can be less than zero and in that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.929 
4ac can be less than zero and in that
case<00:02:02.820> there<00:02:03.479> will<00:02:03.659> be<00:02:03.689> no<00:02:04.200> real<00:02:04.829> solutions

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
case there will be no real solutions

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.229 
case there will be no real solutions
now<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:07.350> where<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.340> discriminant<00:02:08.970> comes

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
now that's where the discriminant comes

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.589 
now that's where the discriminant comes
in<00:02:09.479> handy<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:10.459> if<00:02:11.459> there<00:02:11.879> are<00:02:12.030> no<00:02:12.270> real

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
in handy because if there are no real

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.850 
in handy because if there are no real
solutions<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:13.500> we

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
solutions and we

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.580 
solutions and we
do<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.400> little<00:02:14.730> bit<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.880> work<00:02:15.210> then<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.260> save

oops

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.290 
oops
there's<00:02:22.770> trying<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.400> take<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> negative<00:02:23.850> square

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
there's trying to take a negative square

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.570 
there's trying to take a negative square
root<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:25.110> can't<00:02:25.560> do<00:02:25.710> that<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.190> there's<00:02:26.400> no

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
root and we can't do that so there's no

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.000 
root and we can't do that so there's no
real<00:02:26.850> solution<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.780> just<00:02:28.500> finding<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
real solution so just finding the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.640 
real solution so just finding the
discriminant<00:02:29.670> allows<00:02:30.090> us<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.630> save<00:02:30.990> some<00:02:31.380> work

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
discriminant allows us to save some work

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.160 
discriminant allows us to save some work
and<00:02:31.950> not<00:02:32.520> go<00:02:32.760> through<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.150> entire<00:02:33.420> quadratic

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
and not go through the entire quadratic

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.620 
and not go through the entire quadratic
formula<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:35.370> determine<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.240> there's<00:02:36.450> no

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
formula to determine that there's no

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.450 
formula to determine that there's no
real<00:02:36.900> solutions<00:02:37.560> okay

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
real solutions okay

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.040 
real solutions okay
so<00:02:38.610> let's<00:02:39.270> go<00:02:39.450> ahead<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.660> apply<00:02:39.840> the

so let's go ahead and apply the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.500 
so let's go ahead and apply the
discriminant<00:02:40.800> here<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.250> see<00:02:41.459> how<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.240> can<00:02:42.390> be

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
discriminant here and see how it can be

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.410 
discriminant here and see how it can be

going to go ahead and we're going to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.610 
going to go ahead and we're going to
find<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.580> discriminant<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:48.420> order<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.350> find

our<00:02:49.830> discriminant<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.580> need<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.060> have<00:02:51.330> our

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
our discriminant we need to have our

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
quadratic equation that we want to look

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.610 
quadratic equation that we want to look
at<00:02:53.850> in<00:02:54.090> standard<00:02:55.050> form

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
at in standard form

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.420 
at in standard form
remember<00:02:56.160> standard<00:02:56.700> form<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:58.250> x-squared

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
remember standard form is a x-squared

holy<00:03:00.739> having<00:03:01.739> trouble<00:03:01.950> writing<00:03:02.220> some<00:03:02.520> curvy

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
holy having trouble writing some curvy

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.720 
holy having trouble writing some curvy
things<00:03:03.930> here<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.380> ax<00:03:04.920> squared<00:03:05.340> plus<00:03:06.050> BX<00:03:07.310> plus<00:03:08.310> C

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
things here so ax squared plus BX plus C

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.130 
things here so ax squared plus BX plus C
equals<00:03:10.100> that's<00:03:11.100> not<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.550> good<00:03:11.880> C<00:03:12.180> either<00:03:12.660> come

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
equals that's not a good C either come

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.550 
equals that's not a good C either come
on<00:03:13.320> now<00:03:13.850> plus<00:03:14.850> C<00:03:15.500> equals<00:03:16.520> zero<00:03:17.520> okay<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.560> this

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
on now plus C equals zero okay so this

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.440 
on now plus C equals zero okay so this
one<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.070> actually<00:03:20.459> they<00:03:20.760> all<00:03:20.910> appear<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.330> be

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
one and actually they all appear to be

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.330 
one and actually they all appear to be
in<00:03:21.600> standard<00:03:22.049> form<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.560> that's<00:03:22.739> good<00:03:23.040> we<00:03:23.190> don't

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
in standard form so that's good we don't

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.190 
in standard form so that's good we don't
have<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.549> worry<00:03:23.700> about<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:24.120> anymore<00:03:24.390> we're

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
have to worry about that anymore we're

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.979 
have to worry about that anymore we're
going<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.410> go<00:03:25.530> ahead<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.950> fill<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:27.180> B<00:03:27.540> the

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
going to go ahead and fill in the B the

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.259 
going to go ahead and fill in the B the
a<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.440> C<00:03:28.680> into<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.459> discriminant<00:03:30.120> and

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
a and the C into the discriminant and

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.080 
a and the C into the discriminant and
see<00:03:30.900> what<00:03:31.110> comes<00:03:31.410> out<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:32.190> right<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:33.030> this

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
see what comes out all right so in this

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.560 
see what comes out all right so in this
case<00:03:33.840> we've<00:03:34.170> got<00:03:34.200> B<00:03:34.890> squared<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.640> my<00:03:35.790> B<00:03:36.120> here<00:03:36.450> is

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
case we've got B squared so my B here is

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.960 
case we've got B squared so my B here is
three<00:03:37.049> so<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:37.769> going<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.920> be<00:03:38.040> three<00:03:38.489> squared

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
three so it's going to be three squared

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.640 
three so it's going to be three squared
minus<00:03:41.970> four<00:03:42.780> times

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
minus four times

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.990 
minus four times
a<00:03:43.739> when<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:44.430> case<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:45.080> 1/4<00:03:46.080> times<00:03:46.110> 1<00:03:46.709> times<00:03:47.459> C

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
a when this case is 1/4 times 1 times C

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.680 
a when this case is 1/4 times 1 times C
which<00:03:48.360> is<00:03:48.660> 5<00:03:49.190> okay<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.580> let's<00:03:51.150> figure<00:03:51.360> out<00:03:51.510> what

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
which is 5 okay so let's figure out what

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.250 
which is 5 okay so let's figure out what
that<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:51.930> 3<00:03:52.560> squared<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.190> 9<00:03:53.810> then<00:03:54.810> we've<00:03:55.019> got

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
that is 3 squared is 9 then we've got

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.470 
that is 3 squared is 9 then we've got
minus<00:03:55.830> 4<00:03:56.160> times<00:03:56.519> 1<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:56.820> minus<00:03:56.970> 4<00:03:57.600> times<00:03:58.130> 20<00:03:59.130> is

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
minus 4 times 1 is minus 4 times 20 is

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.500 
minus 4 times 1 is minus 4 times 20 is
minus<00:04:00.480> 20<00:04:01.049> all<00:04:01.410> right<00:04:01.709> times<00:04:01.950> 5<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.610> 20<00:04:03.060> excuse

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
minus 20 all right times 5 is 20 excuse

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.720 
minus 20 all right times 5 is 20 excuse
me<00:04:03.660> so<00:04:04.380> 9<00:04:05.100> minus<00:04:05.580> 20<00:04:06.269> is<00:04:06.450> negative<00:04:07.260> 11<00:04:07.730> okay

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
me so 9 minus 20 is negative 11 okay

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.120 
me so 9 minus 20 is negative 11 okay
what<00:04:09.420> kind<00:04:09.600> of<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.810> number<00:04:10.079> is<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.470> it's<00:04:10.980> a

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
what kind of a number is that it's a

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.130 
what kind of a number is that it's a
negative<00:04:11.700> number<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.360> if<00:04:12.420> we<00:04:12.570> look<00:04:12.810> over<00:04:12.989> here

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
negative number so if we look over here

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.240 
negative number so if we look over here
we<00:04:13.730> get<00:04:14.730> no<00:04:15.209> real<00:04:15.630> solutions<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.919> makes

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
we get no real solutions and that makes

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.640 
we get no real solutions and that makes
sense<00:04:17.519> because<00:04:17.790> if<00:04:18.390> we<00:04:18.959> had<00:04:19.140> square<00:04:19.440> root

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
sense because if we had square root

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.640 
sense because if we had square root
there<00:04:19.890> we<00:04:20.640> can't<00:04:20.910> do<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.359> well<00:04:21.930> not<00:04:22.500> without

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
there we can't do that well not without

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.010 
there we can't do that well not without
imaginary<00:04:23.460> numbers<00:04:23.849> but<00:04:24.150> at<00:04:24.360> this<00:04:24.780> point

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
imaginary numbers but at this point

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.590 
imaginary numbers but at this point
we're<00:04:25.229> not<00:04:25.260> going<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.620> worry<00:04:25.830> about<00:04:25.979> those<00:04:26.370> so

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
we're not going to worry about those so

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.320 
we're not going to worry about those so
in<00:04:27.660> this<00:04:27.750> case<00:04:28.050> no<00:04:28.800> real<00:04:29.220> solutions<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.090> this

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
in this case no real solutions to this

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:38.840 
in this case no real solutions to this
equation<00:04:31.070> no<00:04:32.070> real<00:04:36.320> solutions<00:04:37.320> okay<00:04:38.100> let's

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
equation no real solutions okay let's

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.810 
equation no real solutions okay let's
take<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.000> look<00:04:39.210> at<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.420> next<00:04:39.690> one<00:04:40.310> in<00:04:41.310> this<00:04:41.550> one

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
take a look at this next one in this one

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.720 
take a look at this next one in this one
again<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.840> same<00:04:43.110> process<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.010> same<00:04:44.040> fill

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
again the same process is the same fill

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.900 
again the same process is the same fill
in<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.690> a<00:04:45.720> B<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.410> C<00:04:46.650> into<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.190> discriminant

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
in the a B and C into the discriminant

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.490 
in the a B and C into the discriminant
again<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.390> discriminant<00:04:48.990> is<00:04:49.050> just<00:04:49.350> this

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
again the discriminant is just this

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.670 
again the discriminant is just this
piece<00:04:49.800> under<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.370> square<00:04:50.610> root<00:04:50.730> so<00:04:51.600> B<00:04:52.260> squared

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
piece under the square root so B squared

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.930 
piece under the square root so B squared
my<00:04:52.890> B<00:04:53.190> in<00:04:53.340> this<00:04:53.490> case<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:54.030> 10<00:04:54.390> so<00:04:55.110> 10<00:04:55.140> squared

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
my B in this case is 10 so 10 squared

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.020 
my B in this case is 10 so 10 squared
minus<00:04:56.940> 4<00:04:57.780> times<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:58.680> we've<00:04:59.160> got<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.340> 1<00:04:59.700> for<00:05:00.000> a

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
minus 4 times a we've got a 1 for a

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.690 
minus 4 times a we've got a 1 for a
again<00:05:00.540> times<00:05:01.410> C<00:05:01.860> which<00:05:02.130> is<00:05:02.340> 25<00:05:03.890> all<00:05:04.890> right<00:05:04.950> then

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
again times C which is 25 all right then

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.820 
again times C which is 25 all right then
10<00:05:06.450> squared<00:05:06.690> is<00:05:07.080> 100

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.310 

100<00:05:10.830> then<00:05:11.160> we've<00:05:11.280> got<00:05:11.550> minus<00:05:12.360> 4<00:05:12.630> times<00:05:12.900> 1<00:05:13.140> is

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
100 then we've got minus 4 times 1 is

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.450 
100 then we've got minus 4 times 1 is
minus<00:05:13.350> 4<00:05:13.920> minus<00:05:14.550> 4<00:05:14.730> times<00:05:15.030> 25<00:05:15.570> is<00:05:15.810> negative<00:05:16.740> 100

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
minus 4 minus 4 times 25 is negative 100

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.150 
minus 4 minus 4 times 25 is negative 100
ok<00:05:18.270> so<00:05:18.330> 100<00:05:19.140> minus<00:05:19.290> 100<00:05:20.100> equals<00:05:20.640> 0<00:05:21.420> huh<00:05:22.320> what's

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
ok so 100 minus 100 equals 0 huh what's

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.040 
ok so 100 minus 100 equals 0 huh what's
that<00:05:23.400> mean<00:05:23.670> that<00:05:24.270> means<00:05:24.510> that<00:05:24.750> there<00:05:24.900> will<00:05:25.020> be

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
that mean that means that there will be

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.890 
that mean that means that there will be
one<00:05:25.170> real<00:05:25.890> solution<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.850> again<00:05:27.510> it<00:05:27.660> makes

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
one real solution and again it makes

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.430 
one real solution and again it makes
sense

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
sense

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.460 
sense
plus<00:05:29.070> or<00:05:29.250> minus<00:05:29.280> zero<00:05:29.940> doesn't<00:05:30.450> matter<00:05:30.660> we<00:05:31.350> end

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
plus or minus zero doesn't matter we end

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.400 
plus or minus zero doesn't matter we end
up<00:05:31.620> in<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:31.830> same<00:05:32.070> place<00:05:32.400> so<00:05:33.150> one<00:05:33.660> real

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
up in the same place so one real

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.500 
up in the same place so one real
solution<00:05:35.280> and<00:05:36.740> also<00:05:37.740> remember<00:05:38.250> if<00:05:38.460> that's<00:05:39.330> the

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
solution and also remember if that's the

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.140 
solution and also remember if that's the
case<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:40.260> vertex<00:05:40.770> of<00:05:40.950> the<00:05:41.040> graph<00:05:41.070> must<00:05:41.790> be<00:05:42.000> on

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
case the vertex of the graph must be on

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.480 
case the vertex of the graph must be on
the<00:05:42.330> x<00:05:42.510> axis<00:05:42.780> because<00:05:43.740> that's<00:05:43.950> how<00:05:44.070> we<00:05:44.130> get<00:05:44.340> the

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
the x axis because that's how we get the

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.110 
the x axis because that's how we get the
one<00:05:44.700> solution<00:05:45.120> ok<00:05:46.080> then<00:05:46.710> finally<00:05:47.340> we've<00:05:47.880> got

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
one solution ok then finally we've got

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.690 
one solution ok then finally we've got
this<00:05:48.300> one<00:05:48.510> over<00:05:48.810> here<00:05:51.140> fill<00:05:52.140> in<00:05:52.320> our<00:05:52.560> a<00:05:52.590> B<00:05:53.280> and<00:05:53.430> C

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
this one over here fill in our a B and C

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.960 
this one over here fill in our a B and C
so<00:05:54.120> my<00:05:54.420> B<00:05:54.660> in<00:05:54.810> this<00:05:54.990> case<00:05:55.230> is<00:05:55.440> negative<00:05:55.650> 6<00:05:56.250> so

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
so my B in this case is negative 6 so

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:04.820 
so my B in this case is negative 6 so
negative<00:05:57.450> 6<00:05:57.770> squared<00:06:01.130> minus<00:06:02.130> 4<00:06:02.490> times<00:06:03.030> a<00:06:03.350> is<00:06:04.350> 1

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
negative 6 squared minus 4 times a is 1

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.600 
negative 6 squared minus 4 times a is 1
times<00:06:05.460> C<00:06:05.690> negative<00:06:06.690> 7<00:06:07.730> then<00:06:08.730> o<00:06:10.250> negative<00:06:11.250> 6

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
times C negative 7 then o negative 6

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.870 
times C negative 7 then o negative 6
squared<00:06:11.850> would<00:06:12.360> be<00:06:12.470> 36

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
squared would be 36

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.930 
squared would be 36
holy<00:06:14.880> smokes<00:06:15.390> we're<00:06:15.750> struggling<00:06:16.110> here<00:06:16.940> my

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
holy smokes we're struggling here my

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.910 
holy smokes we're struggling here my
tablets<00:06:18.630> not<00:06:18.810> being<00:06:19.200> very<00:06:19.380> nice<00:06:19.620> to<00:06:19.680> me

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
tablets not being very nice to me

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.450 
tablets not being very nice to me
tonight<00:06:20.360> 36<00:06:21.360> then<00:06:22.170> we've<00:06:22.320> got<00:06:22.560> negative<00:06:23.160> 4

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
tonight 36 then we've got negative 4

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.510 
tonight 36 then we've got negative 4
times<00:06:23.880> 1<00:06:24.060> which<00:06:24.630> is<00:06:24.780> negative<00:06:24.960> 4<00:06:25.530> negative<00:06:25.800> 4

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
times 1 which is negative 4 negative 4

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.220 
times 1 which is negative 4 negative 4
times<00:06:26.790> 7<00:06:27.300> would<00:06:27.450> be<00:06:27.510> neg<00:06:28.520> excuse<00:06:29.520> me<00:06:29.670> 28<00:06:30.420> then

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
times 7 would be neg excuse me 28 then

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.590 
times 7 would be neg excuse me 28 then
we<00:06:31.350> add<00:06:31.530> those<00:06:31.800> things<00:06:32.100> together<00:06:32.400> and<00:06:32.880> that

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
we add those things together and that

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:40.210 
we add those things together and that
would<00:06:33.750> give<00:06:33.960> us<00:06:34.110> 64<00:06:36.560> 36<00:06:37.560> plus<00:06:37.830> 28<00:06:38.370> is<00:06:38.400> 64

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
would give us 64 36 plus 28 is 64

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.460 
would give us 64 36 plus 28 is 64
which<00:06:40.310> is<00:06:40.580> positive<00:06:41.330> so<00:06:41.690> what<00:06:41.870> does<00:06:42.050> that<00:06:42.080> mean

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
which is positive so what does that mean

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.120 
which is positive so what does that mean
there's<00:06:43.190> going<00:06:43.340> to<00:06:43.400> be<00:06:43.490> two<00:06:43.850> real<00:06:44.360> solutions

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
there's going to be two real solutions

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.450 
there's going to be two real solutions
because<00:06:46.130> we<00:06:46.880> had<00:06:47.060> a<00:06:47.230> square<00:06:48.230> root<00:06:48.410> of<00:06:48.530> 64<00:06:49.130> is

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
because we had a square root of 64 is

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.620 
because we had a square root of 64 is
basically<00:06:49.790> what<00:06:50.030> would<00:06:50.090> come<00:06:50.270> out<00:06:50.300> of<00:06:50.450> there

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
basically what would come out of there

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.110 
basically what would come out of there
which<00:06:50.720> would<00:06:50.870> be<00:06:50.990> 8<00:06:51.170> so<00:06:51.920> plus<00:06:52.310> 8<00:06:52.580> would<00:06:52.820> give<00:06:52.880> us

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
which would be 8 so plus 8 would give us

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.390 
which would be 8 so plus 8 would give us
a<00:06:53.210> number<00:06:53.360> minus<00:06:54.290> 8<00:06:54.470> would<00:06:54.650> get<00:06:54.800> us<00:06:54.920> a<00:06:55.040> number

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
a number minus 8 would get us a number

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.780 
a number minus 8 would get us a number
so<00:06:55.940> in<00:06:56.240> this<00:06:56.720> case<00:06:56.990> we<00:06:57.230> have<00:06:57.440> two<00:06:57.800> real

00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:58.790 
so in this case we have two real

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.260 
so in this case we have two real
solutions<00:07:00.010> all<00:07:01.010> right<00:07:01.280> so<00:07:01.550> using<00:07:01.970> the

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
solutions all right so using the

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.130 
solutions all right so using the
discriminant<00:07:02.870> can<00:07:03.410> help<00:07:03.650> save<00:07:04.040> us<00:07:04.250> time<00:07:04.640> if

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.140 
discriminant can help save us time if

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.180 
discriminant can help save us time if
we're<00:07:06.140> asked<00:07:06.380> to<00:07:06.620> solve<00:07:06.830> a<00:07:07.040> quadratic

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
we're asked to solve a quadratic

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.910 
we're asked to solve a quadratic
equation<00:07:08.020> because<00:07:09.020> we<00:07:09.050> can<00:07:09.350> find<00:07:09.680> out

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:09.920 
equation because we can find out

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.880 
equation because we can find out
immediately<00:07:10.840> without<00:07:11.840> a<00:07:11.900> whole<00:07:12.320> lot<00:07:12.530> of<00:07:12.680> work

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:12.890 
immediately without a whole lot of work

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.860 
immediately without a whole lot of work
how<00:07:13.250> many<00:07:13.310> solutions<00:07:13.820> there's<00:07:14.240> going<00:07:14.480> to<00:07:14.600> be

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
how many solutions there's going to be

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.110 
how many solutions there's going to be
if<00:07:15.110> it<00:07:15.650> turns<00:07:15.920> out<00:07:16.190> there's<00:07:16.520> no<00:07:16.790> real

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
if it turns out there's no real

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.020 
if it turns out there's no real
solutions<00:07:17.810> we<00:07:18.410> can<00:07:18.590> stop<00:07:18.980> at<00:07:19.280> that<00:07:19.460> point<00:07:19.790> we

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030 
solutions we can stop at that point we

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.760 
solutions we can stop at that point we
don't<00:07:20.150> have<00:07:20.390> to<00:07:20.540> go<00:07:20.660> further<00:07:20.990> and<00:07:21.260> do<00:07:21.440> the<00:07:21.590> rest

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770 
don't have to go further and do the rest

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.320 
don't have to go further and do the rest
of<00:07:21.950> the<00:07:22.040> work<00:07:22.250> that's<00:07:22.520> involved<00:07:23.090> with<00:07:23.150> the

of the work that's involved with the

of the work that's involved with the
quadratic<00:07:23.750> formula<00:07:24.230> it's<00:07:25.010> a<00:07:25.070> little<00:07:25.280> bit<00:07:25.400> of<00:07:25.460> a

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 
quadratic formula it's a little bit of a

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.610 
quadratic formula it's a little bit of a
time<00:07:25.760> saver<00:07:26.120> again<00:07:26.750> remember<00:07:27.530> the
