of those scents for its like it really
reminds<00:03:32.370> me<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.549> something<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.209> just<00:03:33.420> I

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
reminds me of something that I just I

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.039 
reminds me of something that I just I
can't<00:03:34.260> peg<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.670> if<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.090> received<00:03:36.750> this

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
can't peg it so if you received this

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.420 
can't peg it so if you received this
sample<00:03:37.590> before<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:40.680> know<00:03:40.950> what<00:03:41.250> this

that<00:04:27.210> I<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.480> received<00:04:27.810> before<00:04:28.220> over<00:04:29.220> the

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
that I have received before over the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.250 
that I have received before over the
summer<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:29.580> got<00:04:29.760> packets<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:31.050> says

summer I got packets of this and it says

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.770 
summer I got packets of this and it says
that<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.560> was<00:04:31.680> like<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.890> favorite<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.790> 2013<00:04:33.330> my

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
that it was like a favorite of 2013 my

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.690 
that it was like a favorite of 2013 my
guess<00:04:34.530> is<00:04:34.770> just<00:04:34.980> that<00:04:35.070> they<00:04:35.190> had<00:04:35.310> leftover

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
guess is just that they had leftover

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.320 
guess is just that they had leftover
packets<00:04:36.230> so<00:04:37.580> anyway<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.610> liked<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.090> just<00:04:39.120> fine
