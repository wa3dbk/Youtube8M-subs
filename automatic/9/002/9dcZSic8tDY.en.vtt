00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.340
 is very good is an accompaniment some 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.500
 potatoes de luxe that although it may not seem 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.500
 it is very healthy since they are not made 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.150
 fried are behind the oven and go almost 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.300
 without oil the indirect ones that 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.920
 we need are two clean potatoes 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.019
 tablespoons of olive oil two 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.269
 tablespoons flour two tablespoons 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.369
 bread stripe a spoonful of sweet pepper 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.679
 half a tablespoon of onion powder 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.570
 half a tablespoon of garlic powder salt and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.120
 pepper we begin 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.100
 you already know a very simple recipe 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.620
 We will start by pricking the potatoes and the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:52.780
 we will wrap the film of 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:54.370
 cook once we transcend things in 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.160
 tell the film we will put them in the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.670
 microwave at 600 watts for about 68 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.839
 minutes 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.839
 we'll let them cool 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.080
 once cold we will begin to make the 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.910
 segments we will split in half and then to the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.500
 half the problems apart again to the 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:15.100
 half and we'll start doing the typical 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.960
 segments also get very perfect that 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.270
 we have the potatoes cut into wedges 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.680
 we put them in a bowl and we'll start 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.130
 pour our ingredients first the 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.690
 oil and stir we have very very well 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.530
 so they mix and that with all the 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.530
 stops that we have 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.189
 and then we continue a couple of handfuls of 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.189
 Salt 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.530
 Garlic and onion powder 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.479
 the sweet paprika 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.640
 the flour 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.990
 the breadcrumbs 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.710
 and finally the ground pepper and 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.320
 we will begin to stir very very very very 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.320
 well until everything is mixed 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.320
 perfectly 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.090
 and now we preheat the oven to 200 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.650
 degrees and it's not normal but I'm going to 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.480
 take advantage of the pot that I have that has 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.590
 a furnace head and I'm going to make them 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.680
 here but it can be done perfectly 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.730
 a conventional oven 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.170
 then in our pot we program 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.170
 oven menu 30 minutes 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.680
 and our head 200 degrees 30 minutes 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.600
 and here you have some potatoes de luxe is 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.720
 they make in the oven that are pretty healthy 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.820
 and that are made in a jiffy I hope 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.100
 that you liked today's recipe 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.100
