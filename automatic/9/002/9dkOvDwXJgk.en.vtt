both cup planters meet together that's
about<00:05:49.820> it<00:05:50.060> but<00:05:51.670> I'll<00:05:52.670> go<00:05:52.850> into<00:05:53.120> detail<00:05:53.480> on

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
about it but I'll go into detail on

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.620 
about it but I'll go into detail on
various<00:05:54.110> things<00:05:54.380> here<00:05:55.240> something<00:05:56.240> that'll<00:05:56.480> be

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
various things here something that'll be

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.810 
various things here something that'll be
of<00:05:57.820> extreme<00:05:58.820> importance<00:05:59.360> to<00:05:59.540> a<00:05:59.570> lot<00:05:59.780> of<00:05:59.810> people

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
of extreme importance to a lot of people

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.910 
of extreme importance to a lot of people
is<00:06:01.820> how<00:06:02.030> to<00:06:02.090> make<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.360> solids<00:06:02.900> lifting<00:06:03.380> overflow

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
is how to make a solids lifting overflow

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
is how to make a solids lifting overflow
and<00:06:04.190> a<00:06:04.400> combination<00:06:05.180> skimmer<00:06:06.020> all<00:06:06.410> in<00:06:06.740> one<00:06:06.980> as

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
and a combination skimmer all in one as

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.910 
and a combination skimmer all in one as
you<00:06:08.150> can<00:06:08.180> see<00:06:08.360> if<00:06:09.170> you<00:06:09.290> watch<00:06:09.470> the<00:06:09.740> bubbles

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
you can see if you watch the bubbles

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.320 
you can see if you watch the bubbles
they<00:06:10.370> get<00:06:10.550> sucked<00:06:10.910> into<00:06:11.120> the<00:06:11.390> top<00:06:11.600> there<00:06:13.330> see

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
they get sucked into the top there see

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.420 
they get sucked into the top there see
that

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.030 

and<00:06:18.970> the<00:06:19.210> standpipe<00:06:19.780> goes<00:06:20.500> all<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:20.770> way<00:06:20.889> to

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
and the standpipe goes all the way to

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.930 
and the standpipe goes all the way to
the<00:06:21.280> bottom

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
the bottom

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.360

too<00:06:22.509> bad<00:06:22.690> my<00:06:22.930> camera<00:06:23.320> sucks<00:06:23.530> and<00:06:23.889> won't<00:06:24.070> focus

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
too bad my camera sucks and won't focus

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.090 
too bad my camera sucks and won't focus
there<00:06:24.729> but<00:06:24.910> it's<00:06:25.030> a<00:06:25.180> regular<00:06:26.139> solids<00:06:26.680> lifting

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
there but it's a regular solids lifting

there but it's a regular solids lifting
overflow<00:06:27.550> that<00:06:27.759> you<00:06:27.910> would<00:06:28.030> see<00:06:28.650> used<00:06:29.650> on

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
overflow that you would see used on

bumpty no their aquaponic systems but I

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.170 
bumpty no their aquaponic systems but I
came<00:06:33.400> up<00:06:33.639> with<00:06:33.820> my<00:06:34.150> own<00:06:34.180> design<00:06:34.780> that<00:06:35.880> uses<00:06:36.880> the

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
came up with my own design that uses the

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.230 
came up with my own design that uses the
power<00:06:37.330> of<00:06:37.479> siphon<00:06:38.169> or<00:06:38.970> atmospheric<00:06:39.970> pressure

power of siphon or atmospheric pressure
whatever<00:06:40.720> you<00:06:40.840> want<00:06:41.020> to<00:06:41.080> call<00:06:41.259> it<00:06:42.060> so<00:06:43.060> it<00:06:43.150> lifts

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
whatever you want to call it so it lifts

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.570 
whatever you want to call it so it lifts
off<00:06:43.660> the<00:06:43.690> bottom<00:06:44.229> and<00:06:44.470> actually<00:06:44.919> skims<00:06:45.310> off

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
off the bottom and actually skims off

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:52.110 
off the bottom and actually skims off
the<00:06:45.789> top<00:06:46.000> at<00:06:46.180> the<00:06:46.300> same<00:06:46.389> time<00:06:50.760> comes<00:06:51.760> out<00:06:51.970> of

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
the top at the same time comes out of

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.620 
the top at the same time comes out of
that<00:06:52.180> too<00:06:52.510> follows<00:06:53.500> all<00:06:53.800> the<00:06:53.979> way<00:06:54.100> around

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.330 

between<00:06:58.630> my<00:06:58.840> stove<00:06:59.229> and<00:06:59.620> my<00:06:59.740> barrel<00:07:00.130> with

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
between my stove and my barrel with

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.439 
between my stove and my barrel with
antifreeze<00:07:00.760> and<00:07:00.970> water<00:07:02.639> around<00:07:03.639> and<00:07:04.000> you<00:07:04.210> see

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
antifreeze and water around and you see

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:09.330 
antifreeze and water around and you see
that's<00:07:04.810> what<00:07:05.110> feeds<00:07:05.380> the<00:07:05.830> swirl<00:07:06.070> filter<00:07:08.340> so

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
that's what feeds the swirl filter so

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.330 
that's what feeds the swirl filter so
that's<00:07:09.550> a<00:07:09.669> general<00:07:10.060> overview<00:07:10.979> but<00:07:11.979> I'll<00:07:12.160> go

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
that's a general overview but I'll go

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.020 
that's a general overview but I'll go
into<00:07:12.639> things<00:07:12.880> a<00:07:13.800> bit<00:07:14.800> more<00:07:14.830> detail<00:07:15.430> later<00:07:15.880> on

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
into things a bit more detail later on

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.180 
into things a bit more detail later on
and<00:07:17.220> explain<00:07:18.220> exactly<00:07:19.120> what<00:07:19.930> I'm<00:07:20.050> doing<00:07:20.259> now

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
and explain exactly what I'm doing now

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.500 
and explain exactly what I'm doing now
I'm<00:07:21.370> doing<00:07:21.699> it<00:07:21.849> why<00:07:22.720> I<00:07:22.750> did<00:07:23.229> it<00:07:23.349> that<00:07:23.560> way<00:07:23.740> and

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.510 
I'm doing it why I did it that way and

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:31.350 
I'm doing it why I did it that way and
why<00:07:25.510> it<00:07:25.570> works<00:07:27.930> so<00:07:28.930> that's<00:07:29.139> all<00:07:29.849> catch<00:07:30.849> the

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 
why it works so that's all catch the

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.500 
why it works so that's all catch the
next<00:07:31.539> time<00:07:31.840> when<00:07:32.680> I<00:07:32.710> decide<00:07:33.220> exactly<00:07:33.849> what

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.510 
next time when I decide exactly what

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.029 
next time when I decide exactly what
they<00:07:34.690> tell<00:07:35.139> I'm<00:07:35.440> going<00:07:35.860> to<00:07:36.099> video<00:07:36.370> next<00:07:38.039> more

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 
they tell I'm going to video next more

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:41.189 
they tell I'm going to video next more
than<00:07:39.220> likely<00:07:39.430> gonna<00:07:39.729> be<00:07:40.000> the<00:07:40.210> solids<00:07:40.840> lifting

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 
than likely gonna be the solids lifting

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:43.189 
than likely gonna be the solids lifting
overflow<00:07:41.650> and<00:07:41.889> top<00:07:42.310> skimmer

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 
overflow and top skimmer

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.230 
overflow and top skimmer
I<00:07:44.199> think<00:07:44.500> that's<00:07:44.800> gonna<00:07:45.039> be<00:07:45.130> of<00:07:45.639> most<00:07:45.970> interest

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 
I think that's gonna be of most interest

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.060 
I think that's gonna be of most interest
to<00:07:46.539> people<00:07:46.690> because<00:07:47.139> you<00:07:47.500> don't<00:07:47.770> see<00:07:48.039> that

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.070 
to people because you don't see that

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.129 
to people because you don't see that
used<00:07:48.490> anywhere<00:07:48.970> else<00:07:49.150> I<00:07:49.360> don't<00:07:49.449> understand

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:50.139 
used anywhere else I don't understand

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:53.600 
used anywhere else I don't understand
why<00:07:50.940> maybe<00:07:51.940> I'm<00:07:52.240> them<00:07:52.510> in<00:07:52.630> something<00:07:53.020> he<00:07:53.199> knows

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:53.610 
why maybe I'm them in something he knows

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.909 
why maybe I'm them in something he knows
that's<00:07:54.610> all
