radar<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.220> sticker<00:00:53.430> has<00:00:53.550> range<00:00:54.540> of<00:00:55.199> about

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
radar so the sticker has range of about

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.490 
radar so the sticker has range of about
a<00:00:55.470> hundred<00:00:55.650> feet<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.510> hopefully<00:00:57.510> once<00:00:57.690> we're

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
a hundred feet and hopefully once we're

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500 
a hundred feet and hopefully once we're
close<00:00:58.680> enough<00:00:58.710> you'd<00:00:59.670> actually<00:00:59.820> start<00:01:00.210> seeing

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
close enough you'd actually start seeing

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.840 
close enough you'd actually start seeing
it<00:01:00.690> okay<00:01:01.309> looks<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.370> we're<00:01:02.580> starting<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
it okay looks like we're starting to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.039 
it okay looks like we're starting to
pick<00:01:02.970> it<00:01:03.059> up

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.109 

once<00:01:09.049> it's<00:01:09.500> in<00:01:09.619> range<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.010> could<00:01:10.130> hit<00:01:10.850> page

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
once it's in range you could hit page

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.149 
once it's in range you could hit page
and<00:01:11.360> it<00:01:11.420> starts<00:01:11.630> flashing<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.740> beeping<00:01:13.010> so

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
and it starts flashing and beeping so

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.810 
and it starts flashing and beeping so
you<00:01:13.250> can<00:01:13.400> find<00:01:13.940> a<00:01:14.000> lot<00:01:14.150> more<00:01:14.270> easier<00:01:15.670> there<00:01:16.670> are

you can find a lot more easier there are

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.210 
you can find a lot more easier there are
