Weis go forged pistons which I just love
these<00:00:29.189> are<00:00:29.310> sixty<00:00:29.730> two<00:00:29.910> millimeters<00:00:30.449> they're

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
these are sixty two millimeters they're

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.650 
these are sixty two millimeters they're
not<00:00:30.869> as<00:00:30.960> big<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> 63<00:00:32.009> millimeters<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.660> put

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
not as big as the 63 millimeters I put

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.330 
not as big as the 63 millimeters I put
in<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> last<00:00:34.020> build<00:00:34.290> that's<00:00:34.530> running<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.219> my

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
in the last build that's running in my

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.780 
in the last build that's running in my
other<00:00:35.550> car<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.910> scorpion<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.070> I<00:00:38.070> kind<00:00:38.730> of

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
other car the scorpion and I kind of

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.549 
other car the scorpion and I kind of
wanted<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.629> video<00:00:39.809> as<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> mental

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
wanted to just do this video as a mental

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.190 
wanted to just do this video as a mental
note<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:40.890> myself<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.730> when<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:42.719> back<00:00:42.899> I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
note for myself so that when I go back I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.720 
note for myself so that when I go back I
can<00:00:43.730> figure<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> did<00:00:46.309> this<00:00:47.309> engine

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
can figure out what I did this engine

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.029 
can figure out what I did this engine
has<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:50.000> 3.8<00:00:51.000> final<00:00:51.750> drive<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> sedan

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
has the 3.8 final drive out of a sedan

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.340 
has the 3.8 final drive out of a sedan
so<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.199> higher

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
so it's all going to be a little higher

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.779 
so it's all going to be a little higher
revving<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.070> kind<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.340> want<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.550> make<00:00:56.670> this

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
revving and I kind of want to make this

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.380 
revving and I kind of want to make this
car<00:00:57.059> kind<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> sports<00:00:58.620> racer<00:00:59.180> per<00:01:00.180> se<00:01:00.359> so

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
car kind of a sports racer per se so

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.680 
car kind of a sports racer per se so
what<00:01:01.260> I've<00:01:01.379> done<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.770> far<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.510> can't<00:01:03.510> really

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
what I've done so far is can't really

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.410 
what I've done so far is can't really
see<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:05.040> clutch<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.580> there<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.000> it's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
see but the clutch is in there and it's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.640 
see but the clutch is in there and it's
a<00:01:07.460> called<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.549> competition<00:01:08.939> clutch<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.720> has

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
a called a competition clutch it has

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.130 
a called a competition clutch it has
more<00:01:10.950> holding<00:01:11.280> power<00:01:11.340> than<00:01:11.760> stock<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.299> well<00:01:12.840> as

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
more holding power than stock as well as

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.140 
more holding power than stock as well as
it's<00:01:13.260> overboard<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> 62<00:01:14.760> millimeter

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
it's overboard with the 62 millimeter

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.730 
it's overboard with the 62 millimeter
Pistons<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.720> are<00:01:15.900> forged<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.530> coated<00:01:17.009> but

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
Pistons that are forged and coated but

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.350 
Pistons that are forged and coated but
I've<00:01:19.740> been<00:01:19.890> playing<00:01:20.009> around<00:01:20.400> measuring<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
I've been playing around measuring the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.980 
I've been playing around measuring the
port<00:01:21.600> timing<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:23.119> reading<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.360> squish<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
port timing and reading up on squish and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.450 
port timing and reading up on squish and
quench<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.439> all<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.710> these<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
quench and all that these are the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.219 
quench and all that these are the
cylinder<00:01:26.790> base<00:01:26.970> gaskets<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:27.960> right

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
cylinder base gaskets they go right

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.670 
cylinder base gaskets they go right
between<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.369> block<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.320> barrels<00:01:31.320> there

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
between the block and the barrels there

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.270 
between the block and the barrels there
and<00:01:32.360> effectively<00:01:33.360> what<00:01:33.570> I'm<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:34.280> I'm

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and effectively what I'm going to do I'm

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.760 
and effectively what I'm going to do I'm
going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> stack<00:01:35.759> those<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
going to stack those and I'm going to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.609 
going to stack those and I'm going to
get<00:01:37.920> 60<00:01:38.310> thousandths<00:01:38.840> basically<00:01:39.840> raises<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
get 60 thousandths basically raises the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.770 
get 60 thousandths basically raises the
barrel<00:01:41.040> 60<00:01:41.460> thousands<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.000> off<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.540> block

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
barrel 60 thousands up off the block

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.440 
barrel 60 thousands up off the block
which<00:01:43.439> will<00:01:43.590> lower<00:01:43.740> my<00:01:43.950> compression<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
which will lower my compression but it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.840 
which will lower my compression but it
will<00:01:45.720> improve<00:01:46.259> my<00:01:46.950> port<00:01:47.250> flow<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> don't<00:01:47.670> me<00:01:47.729> can

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
will improve my port flow I don't me can

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.889 
will improve my port flow I don't me can
see<00:01:47.970> there<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> piston<00:01:48.630> actually

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
see there but the piston actually

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.960 
see there but the piston actually
occludes<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.590> transfers<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.460> exhaust

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
occludes the transfers and the exhaust

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.510 
occludes the transfers and the exhaust
ports<00:01:51.439> it'll<00:01:52.439> make<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.680> more<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> higher<00:01:53.130> rpm

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
ports it'll make it more of a higher rpm

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.410 
ports it'll make it more of a higher rpm
motor<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.170> then<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.439> mill<00:01:55.560> my<00:01:55.680> heads

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
motor and then I can mill my heads

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.160 
motor and then I can mill my heads
accordingly<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.990> get<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> correct<00:01:58.950> squish

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
accordingly to get the correct squish

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.130 
accordingly to get the correct squish
and<00:02:01.170> quench<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:03.719> that's<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:03.960> I've<00:02:04.049> been

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and quench and so that's what I've been

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.429 
and quench and so that's what I've been
doing<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.280> hope<00:02:05.909> anybody<00:02:06.240> else<00:02:06.479> has<00:02:07.140> done

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
doing and I hope anybody else has done

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.520 
doing and I hope anybody else has done
this<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.420> take<00:02:09.629> a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
this but you can take a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.570 
this but you can take a
a<00:02:10.649> head<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:12.800> which<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.310> one<00:02:14.490> has

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
a head like this which is this one has

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.460 
a head like this which is this one has
been<00:02:14.700> milled<00:02:14.910> 125<00:02:15.750> thousands<00:02:16.170> which<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.380> an

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
been milled 125 thousands which is an

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.620 
been milled 125 thousands which is an
awful<00:02:16.709> lot<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.850> application<00:02:18.390> actually

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
awful lot but this application actually

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.520 
awful lot but this application actually
might<00:02:18.900> work<00:02:19.110> well<00:02:19.740> because<00:02:20.280> I'm<00:02:20.459> raising<00:02:20.670> my

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
might work well because I'm raising my

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.340 
might work well because I'm raising my
my<00:02:22.530> barrel<00:02:23.340> sixty<00:02:23.819> thousand<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.319> I

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
my barrel sixty thousand so that I

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.250 
my barrel sixty thousand so that I
basically<00:02:25.650> effectively<00:02:26.280> added<00:02:27.260> 60

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
basically effectively added 60

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.590 
basically effectively added 60
thousandths<00:02:28.739> on<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.580> top<00:02:29.760> there<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.060> reliable

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
thousandths on the top there so reliable

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.540 
thousandths on the top there so reliable
I<00:02:30.660> mailed<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.989> sixty<00:02:31.350> thousand<00:02:31.650> s<00:02:31.709> but<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.040> can

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
I mailed it sixty thousand s but you can

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.400 
I mailed it sixty thousand s but you can
take<00:02:32.730> solder<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> roll<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.020> solder<00:02:34.200> like

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
take solder like a roll of solder like

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.290 
take solder like a roll of solder like
this<00:02:34.560> big<00:02:34.770> solder<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.220> put<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:35.880> here<00:02:36.120> and

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
this big solder and put it in here and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.590 
this big solder and put it in here and
turn<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.050> engine<00:02:37.230> over<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.590> squish<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.010> and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
turn the engine over and squish it and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.170 
turn the engine over and squish it and
then<00:02:39.600> measure<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.890> tip<00:02:41.100> there<00:02:41.370> your<00:02:41.910> quench

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
then measure the tip there your quench

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.840 
then measure the tip there your quench
area<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.920> see<00:02:43.920> what<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.130> get<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.489> should<00:02:44.550> be

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
area and see what you get you should be

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.290 
area and see what you get you should be
around<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.150> millimeter<00:02:45.660> or<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.350> little<00:02:46.769> more<00:02:47.300> and

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
around a millimeter or a little more and

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.940 
around a millimeter or a little more and
that's<00:02:48.600> what<00:02:49.380> I'm<00:02:49.500> aiming<00:02:49.620> for<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:51.769> good<00:02:52.769> luck
