number three you want to be familiar
with<00:01:24.509> your<00:01:24.750> breathing<00:01:25.020> technique<00:01:25.470> some

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
with your breathing technique some

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.730 
with your breathing technique some
people<00:01:26.790> breathe<00:01:27.229> unilaterally<00:01:28.229> which<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.619> on

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
people breathe unilaterally which is on

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.609 
people breathe unilaterally which is on
one<00:01:29.009> side<00:01:29.040> every<00:01:29.909> other<00:01:30.150> stroke<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.380> most

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
one side every other stroke the most

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.620 
one side every other stroke the most
efficient<00:01:32.280> breathing<00:01:32.670> technique<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
efficient breathing technique is a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.319 
efficient breathing technique is a
bilateral<00:01:34.530> breathing<00:01:35.220> technique<00:01:35.820> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
bilateral breathing technique that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.569 
bilateral breathing technique that
you'll<00:01:36.509> swim<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.470> breathe<00:01:37.740> every<00:01:38.040> third

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
you'll swim and breathe every third

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.219 
you'll swim and breathe every third
stroke<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.240> you'll<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.840> breathing

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
stroke so you'll actually be breathing

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.499 
stroke so you'll actually be breathing
on<00:01:40.320> both<00:01:40.530> sides<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.400> benefits<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
on both sides the benefits of that is a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.410 
on both sides the benefits of that is a
more<00:01:42.840> fluid<00:01:43.409> body<00:01:44.369> movement<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.149> you're<00:01:45.299> going

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
more fluid body movement so you're going

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.179 
more fluid body movement so you're going
to<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.600> more<00:01:45.780> slippery<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> water<00:01:46.710> so

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
to be more slippery in the water so

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.620 
to be more slippery in the water so
you're<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.640> more<00:01:47.880> efficient<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you're going to be more efficient and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.810 
you're going to be more efficient and
also<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:49.710> you're<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.100> triathlon<00:01:50.369> there's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
also when you're in a triathlon there's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.280 
also when you're in a triathlon there's
so<00:01:51.090> many<00:01:51.210> people<00:01:51.479> around<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.259> are

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
so many people around you there are

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.190 
so many people around you there are
waves<00:01:52.680> water<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.880> come<00:01:54.060> into<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.600> mouth<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
waves water can come into the mouth and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200 
waves water can come into the mouth and
if<00:01:55.619> you're<00:01:55.770> capable<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.399> breathing<00:01:56.640> from<00:01:56.969> side

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
if you're capable of breathing from side

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.510 
if you're capable of breathing from side
to<00:01:57.240> side<00:01:57.600> you're<00:01:57.899> able<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.560> avoid<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.310> miss

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to side you're able to avoid and miss

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760 
to side you're able to avoid and miss
some<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.969> water<00:02:00.360> which<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.259> can<00:02:01.590> really

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
some of that water which we can really

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.709 
some of that water which we can really
you<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.070> clog<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.270> want<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.540> try

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
you know clog you up so you want to try

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.789 
you know clog you up so you want to try
and<00:02:03.840> learn<00:02:04.259> how<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.590> bio<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.240> bilateral<00:02:06.240> breathe

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
and learn how to bio a bilateral breathe

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.130 
and learn how to bio a bilateral breathe
and<00:02:07.799> fifth<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.940> want<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.209> make<00:02:09.360> sure<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.869> you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and fifth you want to make sure that you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.800 
and fifth you want to make sure that you
are<00:02:10.440> body<00:02:11.310> positioned<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> water<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.780> that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
are body positioned in the water so that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.520 
are body positioned in the water so that
you<00:02:13.080> are

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you are

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.130 
you are
Slippery<00:02:14.270> being<00:02:15.270> slippery<00:02:15.600> in<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> water

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
Slippery being slippery in the water

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.840 
Slippery being slippery in the water
means<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.800> literally<00:02:17.190> are<00:02:17.640> going<00:02:17.670> to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
means that you literally are going to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.750 
means that you literally are going to
turn<00:02:18.180> from<00:02:18.600> side<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.319> side<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.340> your<00:02:20.459> body

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
turn from side to side so that your body

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.010 
turn from side to side so that your body
movement<00:02:22.010> rotates<00:02:23.330> completely<00:02:24.330> from<00:02:24.600> almost

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
movement rotates completely from almost

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.890 
movement rotates completely from almost
shoulder<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.920> shoulder<00:02:26.569> when<00:02:27.569> you're<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
shoulder to shoulder when you're in the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.260 
shoulder to shoulder when you're in the
pool<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.440> want<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.680> work<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.270> shoulder

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
pool you want to work on that shoulder

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.559 
pool you want to work on that shoulder
roll<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.230> hip<00:02:31.920> roll<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.360> if<00:02:33.450> you

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
roll and hip roll and so if you

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.270 
roll and hip roll and so if you
exaggerate<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.650> pool<00:02:34.890> when<00:02:35.160> you're

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
exaggerate that in the pool when you're

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.130 
exaggerate that in the pool when you're
actually<00:02:35.640> swimming<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.180> race<00:02:36.390> you're<00:02:36.989> going

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
actually swimming in a race you're going

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.809 
actually swimming in a race you're going
to<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.500> most<00:02:37.770> slippery<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.640> most

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
to be the most slippery and the most

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.970 
to be the most slippery and the most
fluid<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> water<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.680> want<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.920> become

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
fluid in the water so you want to become

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.790 
fluid in the water so you want to become
