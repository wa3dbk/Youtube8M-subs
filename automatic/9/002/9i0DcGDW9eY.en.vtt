 Unreasonable feeling left on the earth 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:59.940
 Because there was a sequel to get drunk on the song Oh 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:05.170
 People call it the Min-mei attack if you are shocked by the song

 This is just my guess 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:00.590
 The next Zentrady fleet will probably attack in third place in a year 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.640
