 Matt Powers - super cool guy, a kid from California, a surfer, rising drift star race. 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:33.050
 Vaughn is a Formula D 2010 champion. He reminds me a little of his father. That's him, Captain America. 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.000
 Autolog Drift Challenge 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.080
 Powers Gittin Jr 5 00: 00: 37,100 -&gt; 00: 00: 22,100 I buy Toyota Corolla and try to beat Vaughn. 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 It has a two-way differential, which is really important for drifting. I'm also trying to get the best driving. Yeah, the car looks good. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Here we go, Vaughn. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 You see, Corolla is - uh - still a little slow, but I basically wanted that. I'll take it right sideways so I can cut the corners nicely. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 What do I get if I defeat Vaughn? Medal or something? I think I'll win. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 JR is bigger than me, so it's good that I don't have to tell him in the eye. Autologist will do it for me. 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.000
 Vaughn Gittin Jr.: 324? Are you kidding me? So I am going to kick him without fun. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Sometimes Matt is a bit too big a bastard, but I'm not going to look like a sharpener in front of my friends at Autolog. 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.000
 I'll go over here and get my car so that I can deal with Matt. I'll go about 1.5 times, so it'll be a little faster. 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:50.000
 I'll give better shock absorbers, add a few horsepower, I can even choose a real Matt's car. I will even take it and beat it with her because it will be fun. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Here we go. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Maybe I didn't have that much talk. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Concentrate! 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Easy, Vaugne, calm. 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.000
 I think I put a lot of horsepower here. But I'm not sorry. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Let's see what he says for this. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 I did it. I didn't get him too much, but I got 337 against his 324. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 *****. I do not understand that. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 You think you can get me? So you ... So ... You think you can beat me in SHIFT 2 Unleashed? You will find my drift score on the Need for Speed ​​facebook page. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 If Autolog existed in real life, I'd beat him in almost everything except drifting and crab eating because he can do it. I'm not stupid, right? I think it's quite true.
