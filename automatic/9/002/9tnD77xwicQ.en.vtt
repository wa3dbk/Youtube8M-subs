00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.640 
bright and early and now I'm here yeah I
think<00:05:55.240> people<00:05:55.539> get<00:05:55.810> the<00:05:55.930> misconception<00:05:56.080> that

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
think people get the misconception that

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.400 
think people get the misconception that
it's<00:05:56.889> all<00:05:57.070> about<00:05:57.340> more<00:05:57.610> than<00:05:57.729> Geo<00:05:57.970> was<00:05:58.410> really

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
it's all about more than Geo was really

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.689 
it's all about more than Geo was really
I<00:05:59.470> don't<00:05:59.919> think<00:06:00.220> so<00:06:00.340> because<00:06:00.490> they're<00:06:00.610> not

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
I don't think so because they're not

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.250 
I don't think so because they're not
really<00:06:00.880> part<00:06:01.090> of<00:06:01.180> all<00:06:01.270> material<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:01.900> start<00:06:02.139> off

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
really part of all material to start off

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.159 
really part of all material to start off
with<00:06:02.560> so<00:06:03.220> I<00:06:03.250> think<00:06:03.400> it's<00:06:03.760> a<00:06:04.330> shaft<00:06:04.660> that<00:06:04.900> really

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
with so I think it's a shaft that really

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.400
