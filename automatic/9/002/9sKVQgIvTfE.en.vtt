and then you can play activies on your
way<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.680> next<00:00:43.920> chord<00:00:44.160> which<00:00:44.310> is<00:00:44.430> C<00:00:44.610> sharp<00:00:44.880> E

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
way to the next chord which is C sharp E

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.140 
way to the next chord which is C sharp E
G<00:00:46.140> sharp<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.830> so

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.760 

and<00:00:51.080> then<00:00:51.950> it<00:00:52.400> taps<00:00:52.910> c-sharp<00:00:53.300> on<00:00:54.020> this<00:00:54.650> way

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
and then it taps c-sharp on this way

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.510 
and then it taps c-sharp on this way
it's<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:54.980> bee<00:00:55.810> B<00:00:56.810> D<00:00:57.110> F<00:00:57.140> sharp<00:00:57.830> can<00:00:58.130> be<00:00:58.340> on<00:00:58.490> top<00:01:00.520> so

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
it's a bee B D F sharp can be on top so

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.040 
it's a bee B D F sharp can be on top so

cord that comes to a B and then after
that<00:02:16.530> F<00:02:16.950> sharp<00:02:18.260> which<00:02:19.260> plays<00:02:19.500> with<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.740> fourth

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
that F sharp which plays with a fourth

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.880 
that F sharp which plays with a fourth
chord<00:02:20.540> down<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.660> be<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:24.120> together<00:02:24.780> or<00:02:25.140> that

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
chord down to be so together or that

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:40.550 
chord down to be so together or that
whole<00:02:26.100> sequence<00:02:38.750> that's<00:02:39.750> all<00:02:40.050> there<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.350> it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
whole sequence that's all there is to it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.680 
whole sequence that's all there is to it
for<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.860> most<00:02:41.040> part<00:02:41.280> also<00:02:41.610> during<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.480> song

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
for the most part also during the song

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.560 
for the most part also during the song
he<00:02:43.560> has<00:02:43.709> like<00:02:43.890> blue<00:02:44.130> ablett<00:02:44.580> parts<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.330> that's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
he has like blue ablett parts and that's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.010 
he has like blue ablett parts and that's
the<00:02:45.780> stars<00:02:46.380> on<00:02:46.530> C<00:02:46.709> sharp<00:02:46.950> d<00:02:47.280> sharp<00:02:47.510> C<00:02:48.510> sharp<00:02:48.540> d

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
the stars on C sharp d sharp C sharp d

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.720 
the stars on C sharp d sharp C sharp d
sharp<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.500> occasionally<00:02:50.010> goes<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.310> G<00:02:50.520> sharp

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
sharp and occasionally goes to G sharp

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.770 
sharp and occasionally goes to G sharp
so<00:02:51.470> like<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.770> but<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.760> most<00:02:53.970> part<00:02:54.270> is<00:02:54.450> C

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
so like that but the most part is C

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:10.900 
so like that but the most part is C
sharp<00:02:55.050> d<00:02:55.260> sharp<00:02:55.310> B<00:02:56.310> F<00:02:56.610> sharp<00:02:57.570> G<00:02:57.840> sharp<00:02:58.020> so

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.680 

that's<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.680> guess<00:03:13.680> try<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.700> get<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.420> timing

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
that's it I guess try to get the timing

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.550 
that's it I guess try to get the timing
right<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.560> f<00:03:16.769> sharp<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.640> G<00:03:17.880> sharp<00:03:18.239> for<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.260> cord

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
right so f sharp to G sharp for the cord

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.420 
right so f sharp to G sharp for the cord
laws<00:03:19.880> G<00:03:20.880> sharp<00:03:21.120> with<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.480> first<00:03:21.660> quarter<00:03:22.430> then

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
laws G sharp with the first quarter then

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.120 
laws G sharp with the first quarter then
be<00:03:24.230> ease<00:03:25.230> with<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.620> second<00:03:25.920> court<00:03:27.920> into<00:03:28.920> G

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
be ease with the second court into G

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.300 
be ease with the second court into G
sharp<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:30.560> also<00:03:31.560> when<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.160> go<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:34.530> way<00:03:34.739> for

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
sharp and also when you go that way for

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.340 
sharp and also when you go that way for
the<00:03:35.340> next<00:03:35.400> part<00:03:35.760> as<00:03:36.000> sharp<00:03:36.690> plays<00:03:36.989> with<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.320> e
