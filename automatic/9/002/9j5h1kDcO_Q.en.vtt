advantage of that a lot of people are
also<00:01:20.340> using<00:01:20.880> materials<00:01:21.600> such<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.490> fabrics

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
also using materials such as fabrics

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.960 
also using materials such as fabrics
into<00:01:23.880> their<00:01:24.030> work<00:01:24.560> clay<00:01:25.560> resin<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.820> those

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
into their work clay resin all those

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.170 
into their work clay resin all those
sort<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.270> things<00:01:27.450> wax<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> big<00:01:28.500> big<00:01:29.369> medium

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
sort of things wax is a big big medium

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.179 
sort of things wax is a big big medium
that<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.420> use<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.810> well<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.530> basically

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
that we use as well so basically

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.039

anything that you want to use for 3d

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.710 
anything that you want to use for 3d
sculptures<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:35.009> use<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.340> here<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.880> we

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
sculptures you can use in here so we

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.660 
sculptures you can use in here so we
actually<00:01:36.840> have<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.470> student<00:01:38.189> gallery<00:01:38.430> called

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
actually have a student gallery called

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.780 
actually have a student gallery called
wat<00:01:38.939> space<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:41.100> easy<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
wat space and it's really easy and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.600 
wat space and it's really easy and
really<00:01:41.850> cheap<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.930> exhibit<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.159> i<00:01:44.189> would
