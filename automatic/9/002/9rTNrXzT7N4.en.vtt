00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.370
 I feel with the ability to do more 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.530
 what rap with themes that make you change 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.809
 different ways of thinking under the 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.300
 well-being that would not give you service but 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.369
 if the spiritual wanted what 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.770
 do you be valued just like you are going 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.510
 well paid foreign artists do not 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.700
 I understand why there are such beings 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.730
 praised do not do the right thing and are 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.440
 wrong incredible that makes us still 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.260
 less valued and it turned out to make 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.510
 he was always underestimated tired of seeing 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.999
 people believing a 6 that they can never 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.129
 be and that thirst for power I could see 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:42.199
 what you did not see that is to give more 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.479
 merit my lyrics than a simple attitude 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.699
 that you know all of them when our 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.469
 country and that your talent runs after 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.109
 the passage of a love was already giving me 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.179
 uncomfortable it's sad to see the stories say 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.949
 that are good and we happen to be what 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.809
 I can check it not by the 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.629
 reproductions but in songs 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.089
 they contradict their actions I see that 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.739
 it is not right to achieve what is not 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.340
 you feel because you are the first place 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.530
 tell me if I'm not honest to tell you what 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.840
 what I think and for singing this 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.610
 the first place grows, I'll wait for you 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.440
 that I see you from here to see how 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.450
 grows on the ground because to several like 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.460
 I have seen you wanting to be in 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.979
 all when not even that in them 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.140
 I do not need to see myself as a 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.450
 rapper to show you that this I do 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.820
 I take it seriously I'm serious 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.830
 I die and I promise you that when my soul does not 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.630
 have rhythm I'll say so until later 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.610
 there is a theme that you saw that is the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.430
 true then what is this singer 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.649
 that betrays everything that sees everything 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.869
 write and you will not get tired of writing 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.210
 these texts with so many looks lies 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.830
 of these pedantic singers who believe that 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.600
 they have done it all because the monkfish 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.640
 before before I wish they realized 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.920
 what years of trajectory can give 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.810
 knowledge but they do not make you better and 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.090
 if the case we go time to my way of 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.460
 thinking would respect me even more if I 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.110
 Lord call me often underestimate 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.970
 not knowing what I think about me 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.460
 name for time and not knowing of my 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.140
 beginnings I wish they knew that talent 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.850
 it is not measured not by how many of these 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.100
 Do not hit or scream ask for the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.900
 talent are measured content fists 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.910
 letters of some lights of your sound 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.800
 most perfect instrumental wants to win 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.110
 people start by respecting 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.510
 see the time to criticize or to remove or 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.400
 give ways to say with certainty the best not 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.800
 has come to this world and if there is 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.830
 then not the known yes sure if 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.960
 the best existed here was not in 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.660
 my countries venezuela sometimes seems like 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.430
 who are already tired because they think that 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.220
 everything has been done that everything has been achieved 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.990
 is the reason why my content and 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.480
 they stop being aware to be more 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.970
 competitive as if they carried titles in 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.040
 waist and tend to defend them to 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.290
 writing tip if you're good because 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.360
 doubts when having to remember it as if 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.270
 you were afraid that many may deny 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.980
 no ownership makes you one more and 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.110
 they make me think that more close by 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.970
 chance if you feel love for this 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.310
 sing what your soul keeps silent that if not 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.310
 short on this is time for you to go 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.409
 I see that it is not right to achieve what 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.620
 that you do not feel because you're the first 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.719
 put tell me if I'm not honest by 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.319
 tell you what I think and for singing 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.730
 this but it is not right 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:25.299
 achieve what you do not feel by wanting the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.400
 first post tell me if I'm not honest by 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.440
 tell you what I think and for singing 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.100
 this 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.170
 instrumental walter 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.460
 and we have to worship the god it 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.460
 it deserves to what the singer
