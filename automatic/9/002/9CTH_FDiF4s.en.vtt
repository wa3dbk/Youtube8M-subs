00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:07.629
 after the debut of the men of humberto 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.730
 is scheduled for June 12 , 2000 in 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.830
 eindhoven faces the england of 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.080
 beckham and owen that will test the 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.120
 Fortress of Portugal alone is the first 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.990
 match but for the Lusos it is the 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.990
 moment of truth 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.310
 the thing starts bad for portugal with the 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.980
 both from paul scholes 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.460
 with a certain parakeet does not quote part 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.460
 cross 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.300
 the goal hurts and the Dutch afternoon 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.750
 is on its way to becoming a 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.210
 nightmare even more so when in the 18th minute 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.200
 mcmanaman scores the second goal and fucks 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.200
 in the Portuguese wound 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.650
 then fixed comes into action and it 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.660
 invent a goal worthy of a ball of 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.079
 gold that puts Portugal back in the 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.079
 match 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.960
 and advanced 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.800
 a little on the shovel 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.400
 and decided then 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.870
 I'll try the door games efficiently in 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.870
 team let's get the result 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.659
 important engine but minutes pass 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.280
 and the trust increases in the Lusos as well 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.630
 as the conviction of not feeling 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 inferior to the English 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.890
 figo and rui costa leaders of portugal 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.930
 nine-year junior world champion 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.720
 before they see the definitive change coming 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.850
 on the course of the match 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.450
 I always take steps for things that 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.450
 baltic slope 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.009
 what thing and the past forgive 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.969
 nuno gomes opens in the tournament with 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.969
 the goal that the match decides 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.569
 Portugal wins 3-2 to England 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.240
 and overcome the test before the joy of 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:08.679
 eusebio is a triumph of all but figo 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.679
 it seems to go with a march more
