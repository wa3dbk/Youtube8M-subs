00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 do not 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.360
 in the past mobile world congress one 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.000
 of the star events was the anpact 5 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.099
 of the samsung koreans besides the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.080
 expected galaxy s 5 fever of the 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.759
 eggs has arrived what has supposed that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.529
 many brands have ventured to 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.410
 create your own devices and 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.270
 applications the s5 already has 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.369
 quantifier multitude of functions 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.470
 all of them monitored thanks to the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.759
 application is health however the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.800
 arrival to the market of the devices 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.340
 best and bless has caused the appearance 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.600
 of gear fit this quantifying bracelet 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.510
 It has a super amoled screen 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.950
 curved 184-inch and one resolution 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.990
 of 432 x 128 pixels its weight is so 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.970
 only 27 grams something that is appreciated 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.880
 in a device that we will always carry 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.100
 with us your battery is 210 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.560
 milliamperes that with normal use we 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.480
 will give an autonomy of 34 days being able 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.520
 get to 5 in the case of being very 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.739
 austere with the use 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.290
 the connectivity is well resolved with 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.670
 the incorporation of bluetooth 4.0 to 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.400
 being a good tree could not 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.310
 miss the gyroscope accelerometer 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.080
 pulse meter and ip67 certification this the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.050
 endows with a resistance to water and 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.000
 dust these functions will allow that 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.130
 we can use the gear fit as a pedometer 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.010
 or heart rate meter or watch 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.570
 the calories consumed once we have 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.220
 had in our hands what we most 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.650
 has liked is its reduced weight and its 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.330
 screen with respect to the design its 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.950
 elongated and curved screen assumes a 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.320
 innovation with respect to 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.940
 devices to date their belts 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.160
 they are interchangeable having several 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.110
 still available models their thickness 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.880
 it may be the biggest handicap which 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.050
 shows that these devices still 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.050
 they have room for improvement 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.619
 the integration with the smartphone results 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.479
 really simple having to 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.189
 download only the application and the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.140
 manager of the app store 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.909
 samsung for those who acquire it 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.130
 once I matched it with your JCE 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.020
 galaxy device may appear 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.729
 a firmware update that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.090
 solves some problems like the turn 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.099
 of screen 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.930
 Once inside the application we can 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.519
 see functions such as defining the appearance 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.560
 that we want our watch 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.120
 being able to change the background or different 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.120
 types of information on screen 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.130
 with fitness year we will observe all 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.600
 our activity from the steps that 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.420
 we have given heart rate or 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.190
 statistics of our dream by 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.410
 Of course the notifications are another 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.880
 your strengths can configure 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.310
 the notification of practically 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.350
 any application in the section of 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.820
 adjustments we will find few functions of 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.800
 those that only highlight the 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.770
 button configuration and a very 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.510
 curious call gesture to wake up from 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.340
 this form only with the gesture of 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.320
 take the watch to the view the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.090
 gear fit screen will light 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.870
 showing the clock or the last screen 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.870
 visualized 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.300
 and the fit has pleasantly surprised us 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.070
 if we focus on the functions for 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.170
 those that have been conceived we can 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.790
 control our heart rate that 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.920
 we can associate sports activity 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.990
 that is being done either a 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.420
 race a bike ride or even 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.310
 hiking thanks to its control 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.200
 multimedia we can enjoy music 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.260
 while we carry out this type 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.420
 of activities just like there was already nap 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.490
 off and beat incorporates functions like 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.010
 Pedometer countdown timer or 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.260
 sleep meter 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.209
 notifications do their job and 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.530
 they allow us the possibility of taking out or 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.599
 not our pocket smartphone 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.670
 It also offers the option of being able to 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.319
 from the gear fit screen to the 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.780
 our terminal simply with a 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.459
 pulsation with respect to the settings 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.650
 we found the possibility of being able 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.110
 set the look the meaning of the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.090
 screen and the turn of it the action 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.709
 of the button that incorporates modify 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.780
 our personal profile or even 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.780
 reset factory settings 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.510
 the eggs invade us from 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.870
 last year but they increase their 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.240
 presence especially in the past ces 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.210
 civilian soap are laser and are brands that 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.620
 already have this type of device 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.150
 samsung is unmarked somewhat of these 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.250
 creating a device with a screen 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.290
 curve and that is halfway between a 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.390
 smart watch and a quantifier bracelet 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.000
 to a polished design of which only 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.250
 penalizes its thickness but otherwise the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.140
 heart rate monitor sleep meter or 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.170
 Your good notification system is 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.940
 the details that we liked the most 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.040
 However, not all are advantages and well 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.050
 applications still have room for improvement 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.970
 for example sleep mode is not so 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.520
 complete as it can be the software of 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.290
 the jawbone app could also be a 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.240
 good option to incorporate a system of 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.130
 goals and objectives in order to obtain 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.200
 a greater motivation to quantify 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.930
 our activity and thus improve our 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.030
 health and if we consider your 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.070
 autonomy seems too short 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.230
 and if we already have to load our 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.210
 smartphone at the end of the day count on 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.400
 another gadget that does not enjoy enough 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.980
 autonomy can be somewhat cumbersome 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.990
 last and perhaps more important its 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.780
 compatibility only with some 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.520
 galaxy devices it remains attractive and 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.220
 with total security a good number of 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.320
 sales the price poses certain 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.850
 doubts since it may seem high yet 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.560
 so you must bear in mind that your 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.370
 curved screen has cost this 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.169
 appearance 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.350
 few quantifiers offer so many 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.300
 functions and with color screen of all 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.030
 ways the Koreans are on track 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.640
 and if the s5 left us with a bitter aftertaste 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.330
 it seems that gear fit has left us with 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.330
 good taste in mouth 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.229
