00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
a little bit more and now I'm through

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.350 
a little bit more and now I'm through
basic<00:00:42.960> police<00:00:43.260> i'm<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.739> khane<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.360> I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
basic police i'm going to khane and I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.720 
basic police i'm going to khane and I
cut<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.020> go<00:00:46.140> from<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.410> finesse<00:00:46.739> shot<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
cut in and I go from a finesse shot and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.850 
cut in and I go from a finesse shot and
keeper<00:00:48.120> saves<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.930> don't<00:00:49.200> know<00:00:49.289> why<00:00:49.500> this

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
keeper saves but I don't know why this

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.889 
keeper saves but I don't know why this
isn't<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.370> down<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.730> an<00:00:50.820> own<00:00:50.940> goal<00:00:50.969> because

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
isn't going down as an own goal because

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.600 
isn't going down as an own goal because
it's<00:00:52.079> clearly<00:00:52.379> an<00:00:52.559> own<00:00:52.710> goal<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.219> that's<00:00:53.399> when

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
it's clearly an own goal and that's when

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.279 
it's clearly an own goal and that's when
the<00:00:53.640> things<00:00:53.940> why<00:00:54.090> i'd<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.719> fifa<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the things why i'd actually like fifa to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.930 
the things why i'd actually like fifa to
probably<00:00:55.559> fix<00:00:55.890> make<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.520> goes<00:00:56.730> down

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
probably fix make it so that goes down

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.029 
probably fix make it so that goes down
as<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> no<00:00:57.239> go<00:00:57.420> I'm<00:00:57.780> happy<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.500> got<00:00:58.620> credited
