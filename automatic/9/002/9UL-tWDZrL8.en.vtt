00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.209 

part<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.719> doing<00:00:10.019> science<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.650> sports<00:00:11.010> is

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
part of doing science and sports is

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.759 
part of doing science and sports is
oftentimes<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.969> clarifies<00:00:12.450> what<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.380> athlete

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
oftentimes it clarifies what the athlete

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.189 
oftentimes it clarifies what the athlete
is<00:00:13.889> trying<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.400> do<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.210> by<00:00:15.750> doing<00:00:16.080> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
is trying to do and so by doing the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.590 
is trying to do and so by doing the
sports<00:00:16.500> science<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.730> training<00:00:18.180> center<00:00:18.449> in

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
sports science in the training center in

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.269 
sports science in the training center in
Indianapolis<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.410> actually<00:00:19.650> put<00:00:19.800> forceplates

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
Indianapolis we actually put forceplates

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.429 
Indianapolis we actually put forceplates
in<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> top<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> 10<00:00:21.210> meter<00:00:21.390> tower<00:00:21.689> could

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
in the top of the 10 meter tower could

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.720 
in the top of the 10 meter tower could
actually<00:00:22.619> measure<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.189> forces<00:00:23.490> they're

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
actually measure the forces they're

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970 
actually measure the forces they're
generating<00:00:24.269> right<00:00:24.420> at<00:00:24.570> takeoff<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.230> by<00:00:25.710> doing

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
generating right at takeoff and by doing

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.679 
generating right at takeoff and by doing
so<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.640> coaches<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.180> athletes<00:00:27.240> could

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
so the coaches and the athletes could

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.689 
so the coaches and the athletes could
actually<00:00:27.869> now<00:00:28.109> begin<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.590> visualize<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
actually now begin to visualize the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.120 
actually now begin to visualize the
forces<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.359> they<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:31.349> actually<00:00:31.679> causing

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
forces that they are actually causing

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.100 
forces that they are actually causing
the<00:00:32.160> motion<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.610> they<00:00:32.880> see<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.719> athletes

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the motion that they see the athletes

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.770 
the motion that they see the athletes
feel<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.770> forces<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> coaches<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
feel the forces and the coaches see the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.990 
feel the forces and the coaches see the
effect<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> forces<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.430> by<00:00:38.670> measuring

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
effect of the forces but by measuring

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.880 
effect of the forces but by measuring
the<00:00:39.360> forces<00:00:39.750> they<00:00:39.870> both<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.379> kind<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.739> get<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the forces they both can kind of get a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.740 
the forces they both can kind of get a
sense<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:41.640> those<00:00:41.790> forces<00:00:42.149> actually<00:00:42.600> are

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
sense of what those forces actually are

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.680 
sense of what those forces actually are
and<00:00:43.110> diving<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.100> need<00:00:44.370> time<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.329> air<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and diving you need time in the air and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.930 
and diving you need time in the air and
that's<00:00:46.079> generated<00:00:46.770> by<00:00:46.800> vertical<00:00:47.370> velocity<00:00:47.850> at

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
that's generated by vertical velocity at

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.619 
that's generated by vertical velocity at
takeoff

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
takeoff

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.900 
takeoff
simply<00:00:49.320> put<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.980> push<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> ground<00:00:50.670> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
simply put if you push on the ground it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.639 
simply put if you push on the ground it
pushes<00:00:51.270> back<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> if<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.020> push<00:00:52.289> harder<00:00:52.620> on

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
pushes back at you if you push harder on

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.709 
pushes back at you if you push harder on
the<00:00:52.770> ground<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.520> pushes<00:00:53.850> more<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.660> if

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the ground it pushes more on you and if

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.600 
the ground it pushes more on you and if
you<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.050> more<00:00:55.260> vertical<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.460> more

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you get more vertical you get more

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
you get more vertical you get more
vertical<00:00:57.030> velocity<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:57.809> time<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> air

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
vertical velocity more time in the air

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.410 
vertical velocity more time in the air
and<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.160> allows<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> complete<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> dive

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and that allows you to complete the dive

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.209 
and that allows you to complete the dive
but<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.079> also<00:01:01.230> need<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.530> clear<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> platform

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
but you also need to clear the platform

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.549 
but you also need to clear the platform
so<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> want<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> height<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.229> rotate

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
so you want the height but as you rotate

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.679 
so you want the height but as you rotate
you<00:01:04.769> might<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.189> pike<00:01:05.430> position<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
you might be in a pike position and you

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.210 
you might be in a pike position and you
want<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.080> sure<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.710> go<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:07.860> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
want to be sure that as you go up you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.859 
want to be sure that as you go up you
translate<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.030> you're<00:01:09.180> far<00:01:09.420> enough<00:01:09.540> from<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
translate so you're far enough from the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.810 
translate so you're far enough from the
platform<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.950> don't<00:01:11.100> hit<00:01:11.280> anything<00:01:11.549> on

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
platform that you don't hit anything on

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.850 
platform that you don't hit anything on
the<00:01:11.880> way<00:01:12.000> down<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:13.080> third<00:01:13.320> thing<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.650> you

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the way down the third thing that you

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.670 
the way down the third thing that you
need<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.310> rotation<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.420> now<00:01:15.659> what's<00:01:16.170> important

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
need is rotation so now what's important

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.620 
need is rotation so now what's important
is<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:16.979> here's<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.400> body<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.270> force<00:01:18.479> is

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
is if here's the body and the force is

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.969 
is if here's the body and the force is
going<00:01:18.750> straight<00:01:19.140> through<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.439> body<00:01:19.710> there's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
going straight through the body there's

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.100 
going straight through the body there's
no<00:01:20.159> rotation<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.299> apply<00:01:21.509> force<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.960> way

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
no rotation if you apply force this way

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
no rotation if you apply force this way
it'll<00:01:22.380> rotate<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.070> direction<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.759> apply

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
it'll rotate this direction you apply

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.370 
it'll rotate this direction you apply
force<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.420> way<00:01:24.630> it'll<00:01:24.810> rotate<00:01:25.200> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
force this way it'll rotate that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.030 
force this way it'll rotate that
direction

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
direction

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.850 
direction
so<00:01:26.520> now<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.150> need<00:01:27.479> vertical<00:01:28.049> horizontal<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
so now you need vertical horizontal and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
so now you need vertical horizontal and
it<00:01:29.759> aimed<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.360> such<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> way<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.170> either

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it aimed in such a way that you either

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.890 
it aimed in such a way that you either
get<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.710> forward<00:01:32.220> or<00:01:32.280> backward<00:01:32.729> rotation<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
get the forward or backward rotation the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.380 
get the forward or backward rotation the
10-meter<00:01:34.290> platform<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:35.070> rigid<00:01:35.520> once<00:01:36.210> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
10-meter platform is rigid once you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.140 
10-meter platform is rigid once you
leave<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.960> tower<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:38.220> path<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.729> your<00:01:38.759> center

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
leave the tower the path of your center

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.940 
leave the tower the path of your center
of<00:01:39.180> mass<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.560> go<00:01:40.680> through<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
of mass is just going to go through a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310 
of mass is just going to go through a
parabolic<00:01:41.400> path<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.869> want<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.229> able

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
parabolic path so if you want to be able

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990 
parabolic path so if you want to be able
to<00:01:43.439> rotate<00:01:43.680> or<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.250> want<00:01:44.430> height<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
to rotate or you want height on that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.149 
to rotate or you want height on that
path<00:01:45.420> everything<00:01:46.020> has<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.470> happen<00:01:46.649> during<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
path everything has to happen during the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
path everything has to happen during the
take-off<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.060> while<00:01:48.240> you're<00:01:48.390> standing<00:01:48.659> with

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
take-off so while you're standing with

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.020 
take-off so while you're standing with
your<00:01:48.990> feet<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.560> hands<00:01:49.979> interacting<00:01:50.790> with<00:01:50.909> the

techniques and a spotting belt you're

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.560 
techniques and a spotting belt you're
able<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.010> experiment<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.760> really<00:02:16.000> fine-tune

your<00:02:16.600> technique<00:02:17.110> before<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.650> take<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
your technique before you take it to the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.550 
your technique before you take it to the
water<00:02:18.550> other<00:02:19.390> things<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:19.960> work<00:02:20.230> on<00:02:20.410> is

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
water other things that we work on is

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.320 
water other things that we work on is
visual<00:02:20.920> perception<00:02:21.490> they<00:02:21.940> need<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.210> know

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
visual perception they need to know

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.270 
visual perception they need to know
where<00:02:22.570> they<00:02:22.720> are<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:23.050> space<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:23.770> they're

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
where they are in space and so they're

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.830 
where they are in space and so they're
rotating<00:02:24.730> very<00:02:24.910> quickly<00:02:25.210> and<00:02:25.570> they're<00:02:25.750> going

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
rotating very quickly and they're going

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.840 
rotating very quickly and they're going
to<00:02:25.930> spot<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.530> water<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:27.130> they<00:02:27.220> can<00:02:27.250> kick<00:02:27.640> out

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
to spot the water so they can kick out

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.970 
to spot the water so they can kick out
hit<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.600> body<00:02:28.930> position<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:29.590> they'll<00:02:29.770> rotate

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
hit the body position so they'll rotate

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.060 
hit the body position so they'll rotate
and<00:02:30.520> enter<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.600> water<00:02:31.780> vertically<00:02:32.440> key<00:02:32.770> part

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
and enter the water vertically key part

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.740 
and enter the water vertically key part
on<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> arms<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.850> in<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.120> water<00:02:34.330> entry

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
on the arms is in the water entry

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.270 
on the arms is in the water entry
because<00:02:35.110> it's<00:02:35.320> going<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.470> be<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.710> first<00:02:36.010> thing

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
because it's going to be the first thing

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.130 
because it's going to be the first thing
that<00:02:36.430> goes<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.940> water<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.570> you'll<00:02:37.840> see<00:02:38.020> as

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
that goes to the water and you'll see as

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.510 
that goes to the water and you'll see as
the<00:02:38.320> diver<00:02:38.560> goes<00:02:38.830> through<00:02:39.070> they're<00:02:39.430> gonna

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
the diver goes through they're gonna

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.210 
the diver goes through they're gonna
actually<00:02:39.760> clasp<00:02:40.360> their<00:02:40.780> hands<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.350> try<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:41.980> go

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
actually clasp their hands and try to go

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.700 
actually clasp their hands and try to go
in<00:02:42.490> in<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.820> nice<00:02:43.000> alignment<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:44.260> we<00:02:44.350> spend<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.680> lot

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
in in a nice alignment so we spend a lot

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.710 
in in a nice alignment so we spend a lot
of<00:02:44.980> time<00:02:45.160> on<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.430> athletes<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.300> trying<00:02:46.630> to

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
of time on the athletes and trying to

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.020 
of time on the athletes and trying to
keep<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.110> core<00:02:47.350> nice<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.590> solid<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.310> getting
