system it's called a daily session for a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.109 
system it's called a daily session for a
reason<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.799> no<00:01:08.040> matter<00:01:08.159> how<00:01:08.430> many<00:01:08.610> times<00:01:08.939> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
reason so no matter how many times you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.149 
reason so no matter how many times you
do<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> session<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.080> day<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.590> still<00:01:10.830> only

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
do the session in a day it still only

toning<00:01:38.220> has<00:01:38.460> been<00:01:39.290> challenging<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.350> me<00:01:40.759> but

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
toning has been challenging for me but

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.749 
toning has been challenging for me but
I've<00:01:42.150> come<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.740> look<00:01:43.920> forward<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
I've come to actually look forward to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.789 
I've come to actually look forward to
doing<00:01:44.939> each<00:01:45.270> exercise<00:01:46.369> each<00:01:47.369> day<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:48.619> just<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
doing each exercise each day and just to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.460 
doing each exercise each day and just to
make<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.610> exercise<00:01:50.939> itself<00:01:51.299> better<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.409> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
make the exercise itself better so to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.209 
make the exercise itself better so to
tighten<00:01:53.310> my<00:01:53.399> abs<00:01:53.610> more<00:01:53.970> or<00:01:54.740> squeeze<00:01:55.740> my<00:01:56.009> butt

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
of those things all of those personal

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.480 
of those things all of those personal
milestones<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:07.170> been

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
milestones have been

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.930 
milestones have been
rewarding<00:02:08.440> when<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.500> discovered<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.459> can

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
rewarding when I discovered that I can

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.370 
rewarding when I discovered that I can
do<00:02:11.120> each<00:02:11.480> workout<00:02:12.110> better<00:02:12.349> every<00:02:12.980> time<00:02:13.010> and

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
do each workout better every time and

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.020 
do each workout better every time and
last<00:02:15.380> time<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.709> said<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.190> shoes<00:02:16.640> were<00:02:16.910> the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
last time I said that shoes were the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.620 
last time I said that shoes were the
best<00:02:17.440> for<00:02:18.440> me<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:19.190> tried<00:02:19.459> working<00:02:20.360> out

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
best for me but I tried working out

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.479 
best for me but I tried working out
barefoot<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.319> that<00:02:21.500> actually<00:02:22.040> works<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.370> lot

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
barefoot and that actually works a lot

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.280 
barefoot and that actually works a lot
better<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:23.150> my<00:02:23.270> feet<00:02:23.540> don't<00:02:23.690> slide<00:02:23.989> on<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
better so my feet don't slide on the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.910 
better so my feet don't slide on the
floor<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:24.980> can<00:02:25.160> stay<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.519> sync<00:02:25.790> more<00:02:26.920> I

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
floor and I can stay in sync more I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.040 
floor and I can stay in sync more I
noticed<00:02:28.640> when<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:28.970> keep<00:02:29.269> my<00:02:29.450> mind<00:02:29.660> on

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050

exercising I can stay in sync more to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.250 
exercising I can stay in sync more to
when<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.680> think<00:02:34.400> about<00:02:34.610> other<00:02:34.819> things<00:02:35.150> or<00:02:35.750> you

this or what errands do I have to run I
tend<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.269> go<00:02:41.780> out<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.170> sync<00:02:42.470> more<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.610> it's<00:02:43.760> good

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
tend to go out of sync more so it's good

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.270 
tend to go out of sync more so it's good

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
on the working out on each move and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.870 
on the working out on each move and
making<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.200> better<00:02:54.410> than<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.160> time<00:02:55.640> goes<00:02:55.850> by

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
making it better than the time goes by

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.270 
making it better than the time goes by
faster<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.750> before<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.530> know<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.739> I'm<00:02:58.100> done
