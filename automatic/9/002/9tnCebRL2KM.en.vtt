00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
went outside for a bit and it was it's

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.039 
went outside for a bit and it was it's
not<00:04:08.069> that<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.489> it's<00:04:08.700> like<00:04:08.819> four<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.420> but

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
not that but it's like four and but

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.339 
not that but it's like four and but
there's<00:04:10.200> pretty<00:04:10.500> cold<00:04:10.739> wind<00:04:11.040> today<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.840> I

there's pretty cold wind today and and I
don't<00:04:13.560> know<00:04:13.650> light<00:04:13.920> it's<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.700> guess<00:04:14.910> that

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
don't know light it's just I guess that

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.050 
don't know light it's just I guess that
was<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:15.599> reason<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:16.079> kind<00:04:16.320> of<00:04:16.350> grew<00:04:16.620> but<00:04:17.250> now

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
was the reason it kind of grew but now

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.629 
was the reason it kind of grew but now
