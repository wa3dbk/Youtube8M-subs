00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.670 
actually 11.2 two centimeter chrome tube
and<00:00:39.000> cut<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.020> half<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> hacksaw

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and cut it in half with the hacksaw

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.260 
and cut it in half with the hacksaw
that's<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> hardest<00:00:41.700> bit<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.910> work<00:00:42.030> actually

wax<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.189> best<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:26.970> say<00:01:27.500> and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
wax which is the best as they say and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.590 
wax which is the best as they say and
that's<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.670> assemble<00:01:30.240> slowly

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that's it and then just assemble slowly

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.590 
that's it and then just assemble slowly
but<00:01:30.900> surely<00:01:31.460> for<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> waxing<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.299> it's

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
but surely for the waxing it's it's

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.440 
but surely for the waxing it's it's
really<00:01:34.290> important<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> quickly

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
really important that you do it quickly

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.410 
really important that you do it quickly
because<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.799> with<00:01:38.009> doing<00:01:38.460> cars<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:39.150> wax

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
because it's as with doing cars it's wax

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.810 
because it's as with doing cars it's wax
on<00:01:39.630> wax<00:01:39.869> off<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.560> stuff<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.729> don't

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
on wax off with this stuff so you don't

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.870 
on wax off with this stuff so you don't
to<00:01:42.090> leave<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.280> dry<00:01:44.549> because

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
to leave it on to get to get dry because

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.260 
to leave it on to get to get dry because
it'll<00:01:45.299> make<00:01:45.420> taking<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.990> off<00:01:46.079> very<00:01:46.530> hard<00:01:47.270> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
it'll make taking it off very hard and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.399 
it'll make taking it off very hard and
because<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.899> goes<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.740> get<00:01:50.689> stuck<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
because it goes if you get stuck on to

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.200 
because it goes if you get stuck on to
the<00:01:52.530> metal<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.360> single<00:01:55.700> tube<00:01:56.700> cost

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the metal so this single tube cost

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.670 
the metal so this single tube cost
around<00:01:58.040> two<00:01:59.040> pounds<00:01:59.340> and<00:02:00.149> Till's

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
around two pounds and Till's

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.650 
around two pounds and Till's
thing<00:02:00.800> as<00:02:00.980> a<00:02:01.010> probably<00:02:02.000> equivalent<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:02.540> your

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
thing as a probably equivalent in your

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.930 
thing as a probably equivalent in your
currency<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.510> comes<00:02:05.750> up<00:02:05.930> really<00:02:06.350> lovely

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
currency and it comes up really lovely

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.690 
currency and it comes up really lovely
really<00:02:07.940> shiny<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.890> slippery<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.840> this<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.260> the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
really shiny and slippery so this is the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.450 
really shiny and slippery so this is the
important<00:02:13.700> part<00:02:13.880> it's<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.950> character<00:02:15.950> camp

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
important part it's the character camp

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.030 
important part it's the character camp

and<00:02:55.910> these<00:02:56.590> junction<00:02:57.590> boxes<00:02:58.010> right<00:02:58.940> that's<00:02:59.540> it

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
and these junction boxes right that's it

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.790 
and these junction boxes right that's it
just<00:03:01.280> about<00:03:01.550> done<00:03:01.610> I<00:03:02.350> could<00:03:03.350> do<00:03:03.470> better<00:03:03.650> but

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
just about done I could do better but
