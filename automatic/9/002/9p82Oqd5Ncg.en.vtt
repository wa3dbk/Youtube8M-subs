00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.140
 there was not a pin in the stadium jesus 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.450
 bermúdez 35 thousand people even more 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.550
 for the party this afternoon full only 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.040
 in the city of sebastián pagador and the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.109
 local hobby that dreamed of a triumph 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 of the saint to climb to the first place 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.550
 he also took his people of course 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.410
 bolivar the pointer academic team 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.779
 yes that is still the point of the greatest 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.510
 part of the championship and that we would go all 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.820
 all its category playing from the stadium of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.700
 his bermudez led in bamboo trout 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.010
 raúl orosco bolívar promo with scripts 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.040
 very equine gutierrez dialogue is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.440
 miranda street house before capdevila art 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.170
 and he will die as he did in sucre 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.420
 last week with iván he came out with all the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.399
 Attack machinery that is left over 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.950
 celestial team to open the account 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.809
 early and so he did because this 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.899
 first clear play of the match at 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.090
 minute 5 this move will come with the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.680
 pass over the area starts enabled 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.570
 William Ferreira was close to 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.940
 bed referee outside the place carlos 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.250
 lampe and so the Uruguayan scored his 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.060
 thirteenth goal in the championship the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.310
 assistance was from daniel mira 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.049
 fernandez was the one that enabled ferreyra 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.470
 and bolivar had the early advantage 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.140
 that now he managed to keep it and not 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.090
 happened as in the sucre match where 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.670
 He wasted a Ferreira penalty and then 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.080
 they lost that bolivar match has been and 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.390
 it's the best team they've ever nailed 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.909
 no doubt he had many stumbles 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.829
 playing at home but have the option 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.079
 number one to still achieve the title 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.720
 in this tournament with two days to go 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.950
 again facing the arrival that 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.929
 danger play 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.580
 here the ball clearly enters from the 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.840
 front on ferreira although it was 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.640
 close orozco 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.130
 I prefer to observe the assistant 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.189
 line and he says that the ball did not enter 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.229
 we have to see this camera 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.330
 obviously the ball is totally 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.399
 over the front goal that reaches 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.439
 reject the ball take it out of the sale of 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.429
 goal a shot you're going to get out of yet 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.170
 more questions 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.000
 this goal should have gone up to the scoreboard 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.979
 same flyer is the one who puts the ball 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.799
 with his body to the arch but the match 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.430
 it was 1 to 0 and there was no reaction in the 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.280
 owner team of portland 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.040
 torrico centurión I look for distance to 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.160
 do not go two kings and gomez and repression 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.720
 of his willow kim forwards and so 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.750
 I would finish the first part with a 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.590
 bolivar and with all its potential 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.300
 it was definitely a nice match 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.570
 because it was planned like this throughout 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.370
 the week I returned to willow the day with two 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.380
 important men with arrivals with 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.880
 a lot of goal in the team of san josé that 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.010
 could solve the offensive problems 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.410
 but that unfortunately could not be 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.060
 do today in front of the team of bolivar and 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.700
 here comes the second a half play 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.260
 rare rebound arts is precisely that 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.660
 house the ball at 15 minutes 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.580
 second time he was very distracted the 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.770
 defense of which companies own the first 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.720
 goal and this is going to hit because 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.910
 final is a free kick where the tapas 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.800
 in archers nobody is going to avoid obviously 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.340
 the entry team player 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.200
 bolivar 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.670
 for xavier the favors of bolívar with 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.770
 frank choice of goal after the rebound 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.420
 and no defender of san jose for 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.000
 avoid that situation 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.459
 but one is the bolivar is pointer by 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.370
 merits of the league's award itself 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.069
 bolívar would not have stumbled 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.290
 a few dates back during five dates 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.020
 who knows now to two dates of the 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.240
 final was the tournament champion of the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.070
 league 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.720
 good start and then it fell 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.000
 Bolivarian did not understand why not 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.580
 won and the coach changed to 1 change 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.890
 to another and it did not work to bolivar but 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.170
 last two dates has not been 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.420
 wrong and has definitely achieved 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.760
 the results that I needed alley to 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.040
 the 37 minutes of the second time he 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.320
 puts definitive figures this game and not 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.630
 there is reaction on the part of san josé in the 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.370
 offensive part and I what I had to 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.620
 do bolivar in a game where 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.990
 I expected him to lose bolívar or that 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.820
 tie in any case and this way of 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.560
 to our home as a local and the tiger 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.460
 assume the leadership of the table was not like that 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.580
 won the pointer and all the same in the 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:05.070
 seventh maple tournament where alley of 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.070
 the victory then in this this afternoon 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.720
 is that it did not go through the mind
