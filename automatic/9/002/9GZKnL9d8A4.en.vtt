00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.390
 good master of the games then the crowd 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.900
 as promised showing here 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.500
 the new sky 3ds is it is one 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.400
 blue button is the new model he is 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.240
 unlimited games other limited ten games 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.240
 the memory card 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.300
 everything was right everything online game everything 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.179
 all the latest 3ds release games 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.399
 is running on the console here 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.559
 in the latest version does not have that problem 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.629
 of the trigger in which it only routes up to 9.2 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:46.200
 I'm there 9.5 point zero brings 23 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:49.020
 beauty only limitation of this card here 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.120
 is the following you do not need to stay 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 unlocking the console via 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.949
 soft tal 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.270
 the ideal is arron that is inside the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.359
 memory card is compatible with the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.400
 console 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:12.030
 here i have an american console can 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.130
 see here the shakhtar focus is that it does not give 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.320
 to see here but it is written here or if 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.110
 you see on the last line of your console 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.670
 my model is spr 001 with the samba would be 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.740
 American 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.850
 if you have a European council the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.430
 Japanese avon has to be the version of the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.390
 console is in order to work 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.680
 other than this there is no limitation on the points 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.360
 that have in the 64 gb in the memory card 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.549
 You can for bills you want. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.970
 only I think it's a bit 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.450
 convenient and email without 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.170
 diversify from gambling because even what 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:01.520
 purchase eight gigas okay I recorded that 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.520
 zelda is a jewel or a star fox 64 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.890
 I show keep four monster rancher 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.180
 garay has 4 gb 4 gb of memory space 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.989
 he comes in here with a ribbon so he 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.120
 can you see it already has memory cards 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.999
 is how it works and will tighten it account 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.549
 with your son in the mall 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:27.250
 It already came as a game. 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.430
 the first game on the list with some 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.319
 interregnums 14 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.689
 How do I do it and is not the same? 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.189
 a r 4 you have the list and selection in the 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:44.260

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:47.230
 a blue button we press it loose 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.969
 it will light up and fashion 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.090
 he will know how to watch the end of the 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.840
 console wait a little bit longer 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.169

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.669
 that I have three he's going to stay 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.590
 training between 1 and 3 if you had 30 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:04.359
 he would say from 1 to 30 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.340
 that's why I do not find you 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.639
 has so much play inside the card 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.629
 memory because they are housed a mess 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:16.769
 you look for the zeal of the normal when 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:22.829
 pressed the button again 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.829
 Wait there he goes with the next game. 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.720

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.170
 I opened the English hand next game 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.849
 He lights it and then when he is 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.870
 flashing because he will see the game good 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:52.170
 game 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.170
 here we have the zeu najari masc 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.849
 If I pick it up again, it 'll come back with the 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.849
 first set of the list 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.799
 you see here some open the obscene 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.290
 made by potato all games saved 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.940
 you can play online is like a 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.970
 original game so much that it does not have 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:24.040
 The one that neither in Brazil branch nor you 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:27.520
 chose the games a little bit that I 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.280
 show active of moura mello does not have 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.310
 difference in speed of the person to whom 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.410
 Do you think it will slow you down? 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.530
 I have this is not the same as if 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.590
 was an original game has no difference 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.590
 none 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:05.860
 I left the game is a thing 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:10.669
 home your 3 10 and close the application 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:15.199
 I closed normal I know it will stay the same 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:18.699
 has no difference will change again 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.699
 home screen 13 10 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:31.170
 It comes to game put what is ideal to have 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.140
 45 play the memory card 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.210
 you do not have to waste time and 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.140
 I created here รณ showed four cards of 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.730
 memory 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.730
 there are three more games and no other 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.770
 4GB memory card is because the 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.560
 others do not need a space 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.430
 this is the monster sound and it was four 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.030
 days right 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:59.760
 I'll put four gigs here 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:06:09.330
 let's run it and it's a 100 investment 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:12.990
 focused the professional school nor 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:19.050
 I do not even have the tone I need to 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:21.350
 margin superheroes close again at 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.350
 game 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:33.030
 The mexico runs the new game is also 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.220
 too much risk 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:38.120
 the text is that several staff are all 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:43.080
 saving everyone are running normal 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:45.360
 Personal guys, guys, guys. 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.700
 commenting there it says it's expensive not to 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:53.780
 I know what the guys the price is as follows 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:58.860
 the sky 3ds card is being 380 reais 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:02.910
 Free Shipping Beauty As It Goes 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:09.420
 run the game the four gigs games 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:11.700
 I'll sell air $ 18 chooses when I 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.640
 I want to post the size and you 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:19.560
 chooses eight gigabytes 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:24.330
 I'm going to sell it at 25 reais 16 gigas 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:26.910
 I 'm going to sell at 30 reais is more expensive than 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:31.550
 The market price is because the guys I 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:33.690
 I have to prepare the card to load the 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.600
 games with him 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:40.950
 It takes time so I'm charging a 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.840
 small fee there we can sell you 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:46.680
 the card is ready for use 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.630
 you can choose two and 81 from 4 and 8 

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:53.420
 It is at your discretion if you want 

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:55.770
 get one of 16 gigas there put 30 games 

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:59.490
 30 will not fit at that time because 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:01.710
 we eat most games have 02 occupy 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:05.040
 and 700 mega or so 

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.540
 already the girl ranter some games there he has 

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.390
 4 GB of memory 

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.400
 that's when I said the question of expensive practice 

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.510
 you will not spend as much because you avoid 

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:17.570
 some points 

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:17.570
 one asked for a card from 8
