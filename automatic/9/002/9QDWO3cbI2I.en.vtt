just went over that's just some ways to

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.190 
just went over that's just some ways to
easily<00:00:08.880> loop<00:00:09.330> those<00:00:09.510> chords<00:00:09.840> around<00:00:09.929> you're

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.379 
easily loop those chords around you're
gonna<00:00:10.320> probably<00:00:10.500> find<00:00:10.830> at<00:00:11.040> first<00:00:11.269> when<00:00:12.269> you're

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.260 
actually target my change I'm gonna just
keep<00:00:49.530> an<00:00:49.680> eye<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.309> stare<00:00:50.760> at<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> seventh

fret basically in the ninth fret of the
a<00:00:53.399> string<00:00:53.690> that<00:00:54.690> makes<00:00:54.989> changes<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.410> went<00:00:55.590> over

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
a string that makes changes we went over

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.729 
a string that makes changes we went over
it<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:55.800> two<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.059> way<00:00:57.260> I'm<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.500> waiting

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it with two so that way I'm not waiting

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.869 
it with two so that way I'm not waiting
till<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> last<00:00:58.980> minute<00:00:59.309> I'm<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
till the last minute I'm not going to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.580 
till the last minute I'm not going to
hesitate<00:01:00.059> or<00:01:00.390> actually<00:01:00.899> miss<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.140> fret<00:01:01.469> so

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
hesitate or actually miss the fret so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.869 
hesitate or actually miss the fret so
I'm<00:01:01.649> gonna<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.890> more<00:01:02.070> right<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.370> target<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
I'm gonna be more right on target that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.870 
I'm gonna be more right on target that
way<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.420> once<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.170> seven<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.860> nine<00:01:05.010> I'm

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
way and once I get to seven and nine I'm

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.760 
way and once I get to seven and nine I'm
gonna<00:01:06.090> start<00:01:06.360> targeting<00:01:06.570> back<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.170> three<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
gonna start targeting back to three and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.050 
gonna start targeting back to three and
five<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.600> that's<00:01:09.840> gonna<00:01:09.990> avoid<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.460> chords

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
five so that's gonna avoid the chords

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.840 
five so that's gonna avoid the chords
coming<00:01:12.330> together<00:01:12.450> really<00:01:12.689> choppy<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.850> not

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
coming together really choppy or not

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.730 
coming together really choppy or not
quite<00:01:15.000> getting<00:01:15.330> them<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> spot<00:01:16.110> it's

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
quite getting them on the spot it's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710 
quite getting them on the spot it's
gonna<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> come<00:01:18.030> across<00:01:18.240> really<00:01:18.390> clean

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
gonna kind of come across really clean

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.249 
gonna kind of come across really clean
if<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.049> don't<00:01:19.439> do<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:19.890> really<00:01:20.280> easy<00:01:20.310> to

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
if I don't do that it's really easy to

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.240 
if I don't do that it's really easy to
you'll<00:01:22.259> hear<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> break<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.159> between

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you'll hear like a break in between

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.859 
you'll hear like a break in between
basically<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.180> would<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.330> something<00:01:24.720> like

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
basically it would be something like

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.450 
basically it would be something like
this

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.800 

instead<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.030> want<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.330> be<00:01:34.390> able<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:34.570> just<00:01:34.750> jump

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
instead I want to be able to just jump

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:43.130 
instead I want to be able to just jump
snap<00:01:35.410> right<00:01:35.650> into<00:01:35.920> those<00:01:36.040> cords

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.560 

all<00:01:44.140> right<00:01:44.290> so<00:01:44.940> another<00:01:45.940> technique<00:01:46.360> that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
all right so another technique that

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.540 
all right so another technique that
makes<00:01:46.660> it<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.840> lot<00:01:46.960> easier<00:01:47.260> to<00:01:47.290> move<00:01:47.590> freely

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
makes it a lot easier to move freely

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.090 
makes it a lot easier to move freely
across<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.300> strings<00:01:49.630> like<00:01:49.780> this<00:01:49.990> is<00:01:50.830> I'm<00:01:51.070> not

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
across the strings like this is I'm not

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.770 
across the strings like this is I'm not
gonna<00:01:51.280> keep<00:01:51.520> squeezing<00:01:51.880> down<00:01:52.090> I'm<00:01:52.420> gonna<00:01:52.660> keep

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
gonna keep squeezing down I'm gonna keep

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.480 
gonna keep squeezing down I'm gonna keep
pressure<00:01:53.020> down<00:01:53.320> like<00:01:53.650> I'm<00:01:53.800> holding<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.250> court

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
pressure down like I'm holding the court

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.490 
pressure down like I'm holding the court
yet<00:01:54.700> when<00:01:54.850> I<00:01:54.880> go<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.090> make<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.420> movement<00:01:55.840> if<00:01:56.320> I

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
yet when I go to make that movement if I

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.720 
yet when I go to make that movement if I
do<00:01:56.560> do<00:01:56.890> that<00:01:57.130> I'm<00:01:57.790> gonna<00:01:57.940> make<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.150> slide<00:01:58.510> and

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
do do that I'm gonna make a slide and

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.830 
do do that I'm gonna make a slide and
eventually<00:02:00.730> it<00:02:00.880> want<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.180> slides<00:02:01.510> but<00:02:01.810> you

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
eventually it want to do slides but you

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.360 
eventually it want to do slides but you
don't<00:02:02.200> want<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:02.410> do<00:02:02.560> when<00:02:03.160> they're<00:02:03.280> not

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
don't want to do when they're not

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.460 
don't want to do when they're not
supposed<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.640> be<00:02:03.760> there<00:02:03.940> basically<00:02:04.480> if<00:02:05.080> I<00:02:05.230> hold

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
supposed to be there basically if I hold

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.010 
supposed to be there basically if I hold
down<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.160> just<00:02:06.400> slide<00:02:07.000> my<00:02:07.180> hand<00:02:07.390> across<00:02:07.930> the

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
down and I just slide my hand across the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.570 
down and I just slide my hand across the
strings<00:02:08.410> keeping<00:02:08.740> pressure<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.250> frets

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
strings keeping pressure on the frets

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:23.020 
strings keeping pressure on the frets
it's<00:02:10.300> gonna<00:02:10.479> sound<00:02:10.690> like<00:02:10.840> this

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.810 

I'll<00:02:23.780> get<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.080> slide<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:25.280> makes<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.640> little

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
I'll get that slide it makes a little

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.920 
I'll get that slide it makes a little
tougher<00:02:26.120> trying<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.420> slide<00:02:26.630> when<00:02:26.780> you're

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
tougher trying to slide when you're

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.120 
tougher trying to slide when you're
first<00:02:27.050> starting<00:02:27.170> out<00:02:27.530> with<00:02:27.680> them<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:27.980> we're

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
first starting out with them so we're

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.470 
first starting out with them so we're
gonna<00:02:28.220> do<00:02:28.460> is<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.640> technique<00:02:29.060> that's<00:02:29.120> kind<00:02:29.450> of

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
gonna do is a technique that's kind of

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.540 
gonna do is a technique that's kind of
like<00:02:29.570> hopping<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.080> next<00:02:30.410> fret<00:02:30.650> we're<00:02:31.370> not

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
like hopping to the next fret we're not

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.280 
like hopping to the next fret we're not
actually<00:02:31.760> gonna<00:02:32.090> let<00:02:32.300> go<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.750> strings<00:02:33.020> to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
actually gonna let go the strings to

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.130 
actually gonna let go the strings to
jump<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.710> our<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:34.580> make<00:02:34.820> our<00:02:34.970> change<00:02:35.210> we're

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
jump to our to make our change we're

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.290 
jump to our to make our change we're
gonna<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.530> really<00:02:37.280> release<00:02:37.940> some<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
gonna just really release some of the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.000 
gonna just really release some of the
pressure<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:39.140> how<00:02:39.380> we're<00:02:39.530> holding<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.860> note

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
pressure of how we're holding the note

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.010 
pressure of how we're holding the note
sound<00:02:40.250> we're<00:02:40.400> gonna<00:02:40.520> still<00:02:41.270> make<00:02:41.300> contact

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
sound we're gonna still make contact

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.180 
sound we're gonna still make contact
with<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.230> string<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:42.680> we<00:02:42.709> don't<00:02:42.920> lose<00:02:42.980> our

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
with the string so we don't lose our

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.610 
with the string so we don't lose our
chord<00:02:43.430> altogether<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.240> I'm<00:02:45.200> gonna<00:02:45.410> play<00:02:45.590> my

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
chord altogether and I'm gonna play my

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.170 
chord altogether and I'm gonna play my
four<00:02:45.980> four<00:02:46.670> chords<00:02:48.280> from<00:02:49.280> there<00:02:49.490> I'm<00:02:49.760> gonna<00:02:49.970> as

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
four four chords from there I'm gonna as

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.270 
four four chords from there I'm gonna as
pretty<00:02:51.170> much<00:02:51.290> as<00:02:51.410> soon<00:02:51.620> as<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:51.860> start<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.160> move

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
pretty much as soon as I start to move

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.100 
pretty much as soon as I start to move
over<00:02:52.610> I'm<00:02:52.730> just<00:02:52.940> relieving<00:02:53.360> releasing<00:02:53.990> some

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
over I'm just relieving releasing some

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.229 
over I'm just relieving releasing some
of<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.260> pressure<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:55.190> I'm<00:02:55.310> gonna<00:02:55.430> drop<00:02:56.000> back

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
of the pressure and I'm gonna drop back

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.000 
of the pressure and I'm gonna drop back
down<00:02:56.450> on<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.750> seven<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:57.500> it's<00:02:57.620> almost<00:02:57.800> like<00:02:57.950> a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
down on the seven so it's almost like a

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.220 
down on the seven so it's almost like a
jumping<00:02:58.430> motion<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.480> just<00:02:59.660> kind<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.959> snap

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
jumping motion and you just kind of snap

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.900 
jumping motion and you just kind of snap
into<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.560> quickly<00:03:00.800> that<00:03:01.070> way<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.760> won't

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
into it quickly that way and you won't

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:13.300 
into it quickly that way and you won't
get<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.300> those<00:03:03.020> notes<00:03:03.260> sliding<00:03:03.739> in<00:03:03.830> between

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.680 

that's<00:03:14.310> gonna<00:03:14.520> make<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.820> much<00:03:15.000> much<00:03:15.210> easier<00:03:15.270> to

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
that's gonna make it much much easier to

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.960 
that's gonna make it much much easier to
move<00:03:16.040> next<00:03:17.040> we'll<00:03:17.280> take<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.460> look<00:03:17.670> at<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
move next we'll take a look at the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.840 
move next we'll take a look at the
second<00:03:18.300> part<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.570> exercise<00:03:18.780> which

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
second part of the exercise which

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.370 
second part of the exercise which
involves<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.940> string<00:03:21.240> change<00:03:21.540> there's<00:03:22.290> a

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
involves the string change there's a

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.510 
involves the string change there's a
couple<00:03:22.560> ways<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.800> do<00:03:23.100> this

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
couple ways to do this

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.020 
couple ways to do this
we<00:03:24.300> can<00:03:24.540> either<00:03:24.950> both<00:03:25.950> fingers<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.730> jump

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
we can either both fingers just jump

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.300 
we can either both fingers just jump
straight<00:03:27.090> down<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.870> actually<00:03:28.800> leave<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.220> the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
straight down and actually leave to the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.420 
straight down and actually leave to the
next<00:03:29.580> so<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.030> goes<00:03:30.210> from<00:03:30.450> E<00:03:30.750> -<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.900> -<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.680> -<00:03:31.860> D<00:03:32.160> and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
next so it goes from E - a - a - D and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.950 
next so it goes from E - a - a - D and
just<00:03:32.550> jumps<00:03:32.940> right<00:03:32.970> straight<00:03:33.480> down<00:03:33.660> so<00:03:33.870> we're

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
just jumps right straight down so we're

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.120 
just jumps right straight down so we're
like<00:03:34.080> if<00:03:34.200> you're<00:03:34.290> playing<00:03:34.320> open<00:03:34.740> chords<00:03:35.010> and

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
like if you're playing open chords and

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.560 
like if you're playing open chords and
you're<00:03:35.220> making<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.550> playing<00:03:36.210> an<00:03:36.330> E<00:03:36.420> major

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
you're making a playing an E major

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.840 
you're making a playing an E major
chords<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.740> you<00:03:37.830> come<00:03:38.040> straight<00:03:38.310> down<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.730> an

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
chords and you come straight down to an

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.480 
chords and you come straight down to an
a<00:03:38.970> minor<00:03:39.440> it's<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.500> same<00:03:40.740> fingering<00:03:41.280> just

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
a minor it's the same fingering just

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.980 
a minor it's the same fingering just
dropping<00:03:41.970> right<00:03:42.270> down<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.510> string<00:03:42.840> so

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
dropping right down a string so

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.210 
dropping right down a string so
everything<00:03:43.350> has<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.560> come<00:03:43.650> up<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.950> go<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.100> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
everything has to come up to go to the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:56.150 
everything has to come up to go to the
next<00:03:44.400> string<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:46.260> that's<00:03:46.380> one<00:03:46.650> way<00:03:46.770> to<00:03:46.800> do<00:03:47.040> it

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.589 

another<00:03:57.160> way<00:03:57.340> makes<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.970> little<00:03:58.120> bit<00:03:58.300> easier

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
another way makes a little bit easier

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.990 
another way makes a little bit easier
and<00:03:58.780> that's<00:03:59.440> to<00:03:59.620> keep<00:03:59.800> your<00:03:59.860> first<00:04:00.849> finger

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
and that's to keep your first finger

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.790 
and that's to keep your first finger
planted<00:04:01.780> your<00:04:01.870> index<00:04:02.170> fingers<00:04:02.410> in<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.560> state

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
planted your index fingers in a state

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.770 
planted your index fingers in a state
planet<00:04:03.160> on<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.370> third<00:04:03.550> fret<00:04:03.849> and<00:04:04.630> now

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
planet on that third fret and now

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.089 
planet on that third fret and now
instead<00:04:05.050> of<00:04:05.200> always<00:04:05.349> playing<00:04:05.620> on<00:04:05.709> our<00:04:05.830> finger

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
instead of always playing on our finger

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.290 
instead of always playing on our finger
tips<00:04:06.250> our<00:04:06.489> first<00:04:06.670> finger<00:04:06.849> is<00:04:06.970> gonna<00:04:07.150> actually

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
tips our first finger is gonna actually

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.600 
tips our first finger is gonna actually
flatten<00:04:07.810> out<00:04:07.989> like<00:04:08.500> we're<00:04:08.709> like<00:04:09.069> we<00:04:09.190> do<00:04:09.310> when

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
flatten out like we're like we do when

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.030 
flatten out like we're like we do when
you<00:04:09.670> play<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.910> barre<00:04:10.120> chord<00:04:10.770> I'm<00:04:11.770> gonna<00:04:11.890> use<00:04:12.010> a

you play a barre chord I'm gonna use a
flat<00:04:12.340> part<00:04:12.550> of<00:04:12.700> my<00:04:12.760> finger<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.390> my<00:04:13.510> index

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
flat part of my finger of my index

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.860 
flat part of my finger of my index

finger to uh hold down the D and a

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.659 
finger to uh hold down the D and a
string<00:04:16.900> at<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.739> same<00:04:18.010> time

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
string at the same time

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.940 
string at the same time
on<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.329> third<00:04:19.480> fret<00:04:19.780> so<00:04:20.470> now<00:04:20.650> what's<00:04:20.859> gonna

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
on the third fret so now what's gonna

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.070 
on the third fret so now what's gonna
happen<00:04:21.370> is<00:04:21.579> it's<00:04:21.970> just<00:04:22.180> my<00:04:22.480> ring<00:04:22.750> finger

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
happen is it's just my ring finger

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.540 
happen is it's just my ring finger
that's<00:04:23.260> gonna<00:04:23.410> jump<00:04:23.710> down<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.100> D<00:04:24.220> string

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
that's gonna jump down to the D string

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.030 
that's gonna jump down to the D string
to<00:04:24.580> make<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.910> change<00:04:25.180> as<00:04:25.870> back<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.860> forth

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
to make the change as back and forth

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.440 
to make the change as back and forth
like<00:04:27.190> that<00:04:27.250> my<00:04:27.580> first<00:04:27.790> finger<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.180> just<00:04:28.360> gonna

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
like that my first finger is just gonna

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:37.760 
like that my first finger is just gonna
stay<00:04:28.950> planted<00:04:29.950> right<00:04:30.280> there

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.790 

and<00:04:38.330> now<00:04:39.330> both<00:04:39.690> of<00:04:39.870> these<00:04:39.930> kind<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.470> have<00:04:40.590> their

and now both of these kind of have their

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.330 
and now both of these kind of have their
pros<00:04:41.069> and<00:04:41.099> cons<00:04:42.919> keeping<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:43.979> first<00:04:44.099> finger

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
pros and cons keeping the first finger

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.540 
pros and cons keeping the first finger
planet<00:04:44.879> what<00:04:45.870> happens<00:04:46.199> then<00:04:46.379> is<00:04:46.560> when<00:04:47.460> you're

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
planet what happens then is when you're

first getting you some power chords

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.089 
first getting you some power chords
before<00:04:48.990> starting<00:04:49.409> out<00:04:49.500> you're<00:04:49.680> gonna<00:04:49.770> maybe

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
before starting out you're gonna maybe

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.290 
before starting out you're gonna maybe
find<00:04:50.430> you<00:04:50.520> have<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.669> hard<00:04:50.819> time<00:04:50.970> getting<00:04:51.120> the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
find you have a hard time getting the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.909 
find you have a hard time getting the
strings<00:04:51.539> you<00:04:51.629> want<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.840> play<00:04:51.990> on<00:04:52.139> e<00:04:52.349> and<00:04:52.770> a

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
strings you want to play on e and a

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.589 
strings you want to play on e and a
isn't<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:53.370> bad<00:04:53.520> since<00:04:53.759> they're<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.150> top<00:04:54.360> two

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
isn't so bad since they're the top two

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.510 
isn't so bad since they're the top two
but<00:04:55.289> when<00:04:55.409> we're<00:04:55.530> trying<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.770> plan<00:04:55.919> a<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.340> D

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
but when we're trying to plan a and D

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.760 
but when we're trying to plan a and D
and<00:04:56.550> not<00:04:56.879> hit<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.060> east<00:04:57.389> string<00:04:57.720> it<00:04:57.960> can<00:04:58.590> get

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
and not hit that east string it can get

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.020 
and not hit that east string it can get
in<00:04:58.889> the<00:04:58.949> way<00:04:59.069> you<00:04:59.129> will<00:04:59.400> accidentally<00:04:59.849> hit

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
in the way you will accidentally hit

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
in the way you will accidentally hit
that<00:05:00.060> first<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:02.550> what<00:05:02.759> if<00:05:03.030> we're<00:05:03.539> holding<00:05:03.659> down

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
that first so what if we're holding down

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.960 
that first so what if we're holding down
still<00:05:04.590> on<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.860> third<00:05:05.039> fret<00:05:05.370> of<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.490> E<00:05:05.580> string

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
still on the third fret of the E string

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.939 
still on the third fret of the E string
and<00:05:06.150> we<00:05:06.990> accidentally<00:05:07.470> include<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.889> E

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
and we accidentally include that E

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.760 
and we accidentally include that E
string<00:05:08.509> we're<00:05:09.509> not<00:05:09.659> gonna<00:05:10.409> do<00:05:10.620> anything

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
string we're not gonna do anything

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.320 
string we're not gonna do anything
terrible<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:11.490> way<00:05:11.669> if<00:05:11.849> we're<00:05:11.970> gonna<00:05:12.060> just

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
terrible that way if we're gonna just

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.960 
terrible that way if we're gonna just
add<00:05:12.509> an<00:05:13.050> octave<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.860> chord<00:05:14.159> it's<00:05:14.520> still<00:05:14.940> a

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
add an octave to the chord it's still a

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.700 
add an octave to the chord it's still a
power<00:05:15.240> chord<00:05:15.569> because<00:05:16.020> this<00:05:16.259> power<00:05:16.470> chord

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
power chord because this power chord

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.350 
power chord because this power chord
starting<00:05:17.039> on<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.250> third<00:05:17.430> fret<00:05:17.699> of<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:17.970> a

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
a G so if I add that third fret in on

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.189 
a G so if I add that third fret in on
the<00:05:29.759> E<00:05:29.789> string<00:05:29.940> on<00:05:30.419> the<00:05:30.509> low<00:05:30.659> E<00:05:30.690> string<00:05:30.810> I'm

the E string on the low E string I'm
just<00:05:31.409> adding<00:05:31.590> a<00:05:31.740> lower<00:05:31.919> G<00:05:32.520> so<00:05:33.210> that's<00:05:33.270> just

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
just adding a lower G so that's just

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:34.670 
just adding a lower G so that's just
adding<00:05:33.780> an<00:05:33.870> octave<00:05:34.139> I'll<00:05:34.319> play<00:05:34.500> it<00:05:34.560> without

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
adding an octave I'll play it without

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:44.110 
adding an octave I'll play it without
all<00:05:35.069> the<00:05:35.159> East

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.310 

but<00:05:45.120> it's<00:05:45.270> not<00:05:45.450> going<00:05:45.570> to<00:05:45.690> be<00:05:45.750> a<00:05:45.780> note<00:05:46.110> that

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
but it's not going to be a note that

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.780 
but it's not going to be a note that
doesn't<00:05:46.530> belong<00:05:46.680> to<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.950> court<00:05:47.220> if<00:05:47.490> you're

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
doesn't belong to the court if you're

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.360 
doesn't belong to the court if you're
playing<00:05:48.000> in<00:05:48.150> an<00:05:48.240> open<00:05:48.600> or<00:05:48.870> let's<00:05:49.770> say<00:05:49.950> we're

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
playing in an open or let's say we're

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.980 
playing in an open or let's say we're
holding<00:05:50.760> on<00:05:50.850> the<00:05:50.970> fifth<00:05:51.210> fourth<00:05:51.540> and<00:05:51.720> sixth

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
holding on the fifth fourth and sixth

00:05:51.990 --> 00:06:02.140 
holding on the fifth fourth and sixth
fret<00:05:52.200> of<00:05:52.560> the<00:05:52.680> d-string

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.520 

so<00:06:03.150> it's<00:06:03.270> kind<00:06:03.420> of<00:06:03.480> a<00:06:03.570> good<00:06:03.750> like<00:06:03.930> back-up<00:06:04.410> plan

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
so it's kind of a good like back-up plan

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.110 
so it's kind of a good like back-up plan
basically<00:06:04.890> so<00:06:05.520> you're<00:06:05.640> safe<00:06:05.910> from

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
basically so you're safe from

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.790 
basically so you're safe from
accidentally<00:06:06.690> over<00:06:07.020> strumming<00:06:07.470> and<00:06:07.560> hitting

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
accidentally over strumming and hitting

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.670 
accidentally over strumming and hitting
and<00:06:07.890> hitting<00:06:07.950> the<00:06:08.730> E<00:06:08.760> string<00:06:10.250> all<00:06:11.250> right

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
and hitting the E string all right

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.010 
and hitting the E string all right
next<00:06:13.880> the<00:06:14.880> final<00:06:15.240> technique<00:06:15.510> we'll<00:06:15.810> start

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
next the final technique we'll start

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.710 
next the final technique we'll start
getting<00:06:16.320> to<00:06:16.410> for<00:06:16.590> this<00:06:16.680> part<00:06:16.920> is<00:06:17.690> muting<00:06:18.690> the

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
getting to for this part is muting the

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.110 
getting to for this part is muting the
strings<00:06:18.840> with<00:06:19.380> your<00:06:19.410> index<00:06:19.920> finger<00:06:20.370> so<00:06:21.090> that

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
strings with your index finger so that

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.680 
strings with your index finger so that
is<00:06:21.870> gonna<00:06:22.170> help<00:06:22.470> you<00:06:22.590> avoid<00:06:22.890> hearing<00:06:23.550> the<00:06:23.820> the

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
is gonna help you avoid hearing the the

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.080 
is gonna help you avoid hearing the the
length<00:06:24.930> of<00:06:25.140> the<00:06:25.590> other<00:06:25.770> strings<00:06:26.100> that<00:06:27.000> you

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
length of the other strings that you

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.030 
length of the other strings that you
don't<00:06:27.270> want<00:06:27.390> to<00:06:27.450> hear<00:06:27.630> in<00:06:27.720> the<00:06:27.810> chord<00:06:28.050> we're<00:06:28.800> if

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
don't want to hear in the chord we're if

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.980 
don't want to hear in the chord we're if
we're<00:06:29.160> playing<00:06:29.400> on<00:06:29.490> the<00:06:29.580> E<00:06:29.610> and<00:06:29.730> a<00:06:29.940> string<00:06:30.270> we

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
we're playing on the E and a string we

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.440 
we're playing on the E and a string we
don't<00:06:31.170> want<00:06:31.410> to<00:06:31.500> hit<00:06:31.680> the<00:06:32.190> D<00:06:32.430> G<00:06:32.670> B<00:06:32.940> or<00:06:33.270> high<00:06:33.420> E

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
don't want to hit the D G B or high E

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.350 
don't want to hit the D G B or high E
strings<00:06:34.020> and<00:06:34.700> when<00:06:35.700> you're<00:06:35.820> strumming<00:06:36.090> it's

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
strings and when you're strumming it's

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.240 
strings and when you're strumming it's
kind<00:06:36.570> of<00:06:36.660> it<00:06:37.110> takes<00:06:37.620> a<00:06:37.740> little<00:06:37.860> while<00:06:38.010> to<00:06:38.070> get

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
kind of it takes a little while to get

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.930 
kind of it takes a little while to get
used<00:06:38.310> to<00:06:38.580> that

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
used to that

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.630 
used to that
so<00:06:39.540> what<00:06:39.720> I'll<00:06:39.840> do<00:06:40.070> is<00:06:41.070> I'm<00:06:41.220> gonna<00:06:41.340> hold<00:06:41.490> the

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
so what I'll do is I'm gonna hold the

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.520 
so what I'll do is I'm gonna hold the
chord<00:06:41.910> like<00:06:42.420> normal<00:06:42.840> we'll<00:06:42.990> say<00:06:43.140> we'll<00:06:43.350> go<00:06:43.470> to

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
chord like normal we'll say we'll go to

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.750 
chord like normal we'll say we'll go to
the<00:06:43.650> 5th<00:06:43.890> and<00:06:44.070> 7th<00:06:44.370> fret<00:06:44.580> 5<00:06:45.150> on<00:06:45.210> to<00:06:45.480> e7<00:06:45.930> on<00:06:46.170> a<00:06:46.760> and

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
the 5th and 7th fret 5 on to e7 on a and

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.510 
the 5th and 7th fret 5 on to e7 on a and
I'm<00:06:48.450> on<00:06:48.570> my<00:06:48.600> fingertips<00:06:49.200> right<00:06:49.410> now<00:06:49.560> and<00:06:49.890> what

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
I'm on my fingertips right now and what

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.920 
I'm on my fingertips right now and what
I'm<00:06:50.580> going<00:06:50.700> to<00:06:50.730> do<00:06:50.850> is<00:06:50.940> let<00:06:51.090> my<00:06:51.180> index<00:06:51.570> finger

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
I'm going to do is let my index finger

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.530 
I'm going to do is let my index finger
just<00:06:52.230> kind<00:06:52.710> of<00:06:52.830> relax<00:06:53.640> and<00:06:53.910> like<00:06:54.060> flat<00:06:54.330> across

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:54.540 
just kind of relax and like flat across

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.360 
just kind of relax and like flat across
the<00:06:54.630> strings<00:06:55.050> I'm<00:06:55.380> not<00:06:55.590> pushing<00:06:55.800> down<00:06:56.010> like<00:06:56.310> a

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
the strings I'm not pushing down like a

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.250 
the strings I'm not pushing down like a
barre<00:06:56.550> chord<00:06:56.580> I'm<00:06:56.970> just<00:06:57.210> resting<00:06:57.750> it<00:06:57.840> across

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
barre chord I'm just resting it across

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.140 
barre chord I'm just resting it across
the<00:06:58.440> other<00:06:58.530> strings<00:06:58.950> so<00:06:59.520> now<00:06:59.700> it's<00:06:59.850> gonna<00:06:59.940> make

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
the other strings so now it's gonna make

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.250 
the other strings so now it's gonna make
a<00:07:00.180> string<00:07:00.540> if<00:07:01.320> I<00:07:01.470> play<00:07:01.650> on<00:07:01.800> strings<00:07:02.630> D<00:07:03.630> G<00:07:03.930> B<00:07:03.960> and

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
a string if I play on strings D G B and

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.230 
a string if I play on strings D G B and
E<00:07:06.560> that's<00:07:07.560> all<00:07:07.800> you<00:07:07.919> hear<00:07:08.100> now<00:07:08.310> it<00:07:08.880> does<00:07:09.060> make

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 
E that's all you hear now it does make

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.510 
E that's all you hear now it does make
some<00:07:09.480> sound<00:07:09.840> but<00:07:10.110> the<00:07:10.440> the<00:07:11.130> notes<00:07:11.340> of<00:07:11.460> the

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
some sound but the the notes of the

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.740 
some sound but the the notes of the
power<00:07:11.730> chord<00:07:12.000> are<00:07:12.120> going<00:07:12.240> to<00:07:12.300> drill<00:07:12.480> that<00:07:12.690> out

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
power chord are going to drill that out

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.720 
power chord are going to drill that out
so<00:07:13.350> now<00:07:13.500> I<00:07:13.530> can<00:07:13.740> strum<00:07:14.040> all<00:07:14.220> the<00:07:14.280> way<00:07:14.460> through

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:14.730 
so now I can strum all the way through

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:20.250 
so now I can strum all the way through
and<00:07:14.940> still<00:07:15.120> just<00:07:15.390> hear<00:07:15.600> the<00:07:15.720> e<00:07:15.750> of<00:07:15.960> a<00:07:16.080> string

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:20.260 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.590 

that's<00:07:21.260> very<00:07:21.380> helpful<00:07:21.650> technique<00:07:22.600> we're

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:23.600 
that's very helpful technique we're

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.629 
that's very helpful technique we're
trying<00:07:24.110> to<00:07:24.290> have<00:07:24.470> just<00:07:24.800> kind<00:07:24.979> of<00:07:25.130> first<00:07:25.400> maybe

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 
trying to have just kind of first maybe

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.590 
trying to have just kind of first maybe
go<00:07:25.820> one<00:07:26.000> string<00:07:26.270> at<00:07:26.360> a<00:07:26.389> time<00:07:28.270> to<00:07:29.270> make<00:07:29.300> sure

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:29.600 
go one string at a time to make sure

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.760 
go one string at a time to make sure
you're<00:07:29.750> not<00:07:29.840> excellently<00:07:30.260> pushing<00:07:30.590> down<00:07:30.740> on

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:30.770 
you're not excellently pushing down on

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.870 
you're not excellently pushing down on
the<00:07:31.419> DRG<00:07:32.419> strings<00:07:33.639> getting<00:07:34.639> a<00:07:34.760> different

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 
the DRG strings getting a different

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.900 
the DRG strings getting a different
cording<00:07:35.360> and<00:07:36.460> that's<00:07:37.460> going<00:07:37.580> to<00:07:37.639> be<00:07:37.760> it<00:07:37.880> for

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:37.910 
cording and that's going to be it for

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.640 
cording and that's going to be it for
this<00:07:38.180> section<00:07:38.419> of<00:07:38.660> the<00:07:38.690> video<00:07:38.810> I'll<00:07:39.260> do<00:07:39.470> one

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:39.650 
this section of the video I'll do one

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.020 
this section of the video I'll do one
more<00:07:39.680> section<00:07:40.040> on<00:07:40.490> a<00:07:40.520> little<00:07:40.729> bit<00:07:40.880> more

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.030 
more section on a little bit more
